S'In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, and sambal. Add the raspberries, pineapple, strawberries, kiwi, red onion, cilantro and mint and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes, ensuring flavors are well blended.Rinse the chicken breasts, pat dry with a paper towels, then generously coat with the blackening seasoning. In a large heavy-bottom pan, over medium-high heat, add the grapeseed oil and allow the oil to heat. Carefully add the chicken, cover and cook for 4 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and turn the chicken over. Repeat the cooking process until the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, normally taking 13 to 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan to a serving platter to allow it to rest and finish cooking. When the temperature reaches 165 degrees F serve with the fruit salsa.'

S'Toss calamari with buttermilk in a non-reactive bowl, cover and let marinated in the refrigerator for 2 hours.Make topping by heating olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet. Add peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, scallions, fresh ginger, and wasabi and saute until peppers are tender and flavors integrate. Remove from heat and set aside.Drain marinated calamari through a strainer or colander. Heat canola oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (or as deep-fryer manufacturer directs for similar foods). To make tempura, mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Dredge sliced calamari in the dry mix, then set aside briefly. Add seltzer in a stream to the tempura mix while whisking constantly to make into a batter. Dip calamari into the batter or ladle batter over the calamari, and place into the deep-fryer basket, frying for a minute or two until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.Finish by adjusting seasoning in topping with salt and pepper. Serve topping over fried calamari and squeeze lemon and lime juice over.'

S'Season the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat 1/8 cup of the canola oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Dredge the steaks in flour, and shake to remove excess. Sear the steaks on both sides, remove from pan, and set aside on a utility platter. Add the other 1/8 cup of canola oil to the same pan and saute the onions and mushrooms until the onions become translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken or beef broth, porter beer, molasses, thyme, hot sauce and bay leaves to the onion/mushroom mixture. Reduce the heat to low and return the steaks to the pan. Simmer covered for at least 2 hours. Rump steaks are a tough meat and will require slow cooking (braising). You may wish transfer the ingredients to a crock-pot for this process. When the steaks are fork tender, remove them to a platter in a warm place. The liquid in the pan should have evaporated to a large degree, intensifying the flavor. If necessary, increase the heat to reduce and thicken into a sauce. Whisk in the butter and creme fraiche or sour cream to finish the sauce, and spoon sauce over the steaks. Garnish with the fresh chopped chives.'

Add the white wine and allow most of it to evaporate. Stir in the paprika, parsley, cup of bloomed saffron, and chicken stock, and bring to a gentle boil. Return the chorizo and chicken to the pan, and add the octopus. Stir in the rice, salt and pepper and reduce heat to medium. Cook uncovered without stirring for about 20 minutes, then add the mussels and cover. Let cook until the mussels open, about 7 minutes, then remove them to a utility platter.

S'In a large saute pot, cook the bacon until crisp over medium heat. While the bacon is cooking, season the beef cubes with Smokey Rotisserie seasoning and coat with flour. Remove the cooked bacon to a utility platter and add the floured beef cubes to the pot. Allow the beef cubes to sear undisturbed for about 2 minutes before turning, to allow the flavors to integrate into the surface of the meat. Brown the beef cubes this way on all sides, then remove the cubes to the platter with the bacon. Pour most of the fat out of the pan, leaving only about 1 tablespoon. Add the onion to the pan and cook it begins to turn translucent. De-glaze with the wine and allow it to reduce by half. Bring the heat down to low and return the bacon and beef to the pot. Add beef stock, and carrots, and stir in demi-glace, tomato paste, garlic, bay leaf and tarragon. Cover and braise for about 3 hours, adding mushrooms and pearl onions in last 30 minutes.Served with boiled new potatoes.'

S'Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Peel parsnips, and cut into 1-inch chunks, brush lightly with oil and place on a baking sheet lined with heavy duty aluminum foil (for easy cleanup). Roast until the parsnips begin to soften (as tested with a knife blade) and until the tips begin to turn golden brown. This takes about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for a few minutes while you start the other ingredients in the stockpot. (Leave oven on for toasting of croutons.)Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a large stockpot and gently saute the onion until translucent. (This takes about 10 minutes, but the more important thing is that they look translucent.) Add the chicken stock, slice open the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the pot and add along with the vanilla pod itself. Increase heat to medium, add the roasted parsnips, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper, cover and let cook until the parsnips are completely tender, about 20 minutes.Once you have the soup underway, toast the croutons in the oven which is already preheated to 400 degrees F. Cut the epee loaf into 3/4-inch thick slices. Brush the bread with oil and place on a foil lined baking sheet (important for cleanup purposes). Sift dark cocoa over the bread and toast briefly in the oven, just to make crispy. Remove and set aside.Stir the white chocolate chips into the soup and cook for a further 5 minutes, to allow them to melt and to integrate flavors.Remove soup from heat, discard vanilla pod, and stir in heavy cream. Using an immersion blender, blend until smooth. (Remember, when using an immersion blender, the blade end has to be immersed, or it will make a big mess.)  Squeeze fresh lemon or lime juice into the pot and stir to combine. (Note: If you hold the sliced end of the fresh lemon or lime against your palm while you squeeze in the juice, the seeds are likely to stay in the rind.)Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with fresh dill. Serve with lemon wedges and dark chocolate dusted croutons.'

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Slice tomatillos in half, lengthwise and remove stem end and core. Scoop out and discard the seeds, leaving as much pulp as possible. Place tomatillos, cut side up on baking sheet. Combine garlic and oil and spoon over the tomatoes, then season with salt and pepper. Roast for about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven to let cool. Cut tomatillos in halves.While the tomatillos are roasting, remove casings from chorizo and brown in a fry pan over medium heat.While the meat is browning, heat the canola oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. Lay the tortillas out on a utility platter. Remove the browned sausage meat from heat, drain any extra fat from the pan, then add brie and let the cheese melt into the meat. Stir in the roasted tomatillos, yogurt and green onions. Spoon the meat/cheese mixture evenly into each of the tortillas. Roll them closed and secure with toothpicks. Deep-fry until golden brown and drain on paper toweling. Remove toothpicks before serving. Serve with tomatillo mint salsa.'

With a fork, stir in just enough water to bind the dough. Gather into a ball and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Roll out to about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to a 9-inch pie pan and trim to leave a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under for a double thickness. Flute the edge with your fingers. Refrigerate.For the filling and topping:Peel, core and slice the apples into a mixing bowl. Add lemon juice and stir to coat apples. In a separate small bowl, mix together the cornstarch, salt, and just 1/3 cup of the sugar (reserving the rest for the topping). Add the sugar mixture to the apples and stir to blend.For the crumb topping, combine the remaining sugar, flour, cinnamon and butter in a bowl. Blend with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside.Spoon the fruit filling into the pie shell. Sprinkle the crumbs lightly and evenly over the top. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Cover the top of the pie loosely with a sheet of foil, and continue baking until browned, 35 to 40 minutes more.For the Banana Creme:In a large saucepan mix sugar, cornstarch, and salt and blend well, before putting on stovetop. Gradually whisk in milk and vanilla extract until combined, then whisk egg yolks in until no yellow streaks remain. Bring to a simmer over low heat whisking to keep smooth.

S'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice the root end off the entire head of garlic and turn it upside down, wrap it in aluminum foil and mold the foil so it supports the garlic to allow the cut end to stand upright in the oven. Pour 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil on the garlic so it slips between the skin and the cloves and wrap with the foil so it is enclosed. Roast for about 1 hour and set aside until it is cool enough to handle.To make the olive salsa for the chicken topping, in a small bowl combine the tomato, basil, parsley, peppercorns, olives and 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil. Gently squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from the skins into the mixture. Fold everything together and set aside to let flavors integrate.For the rice accompaniment to the chicken, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and stir in the basmati rice, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper, allowing rice to toast for a few minutes. Then add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer covered and undisturbed for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.In a large saute pan, heat the chicken broth over medium high heat. Add the basil, tarragon and parsley, bring to a boil to integrate flavors, then reduce heat. This is your poaching liquid. Season the chicken breasts generously on both sides with salt and pepper, rubbing the seasoning in, and place the chicken in simmering poaching liquid. (Remember, you are poaching, not boiling. The liquid should be kept at a simmer.) Poach chicken until cooked through, about 10 minutes, turning breasts midway through cooking period. Remove to paper towels to drain.Spoon some basmati rice onto serving plate, top with a piece of chicken, and spoon olive salsa over chicken.  Garnish with baby carrots.'

S"Dredge the turtle in flour. In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepot over high heat, melt the butter and brown the turtle pieces, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the turtle from pan and allow to cool enough to handle. Deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping the bits from the bottom and sides.Add the celery, onion, carrots to the pot. Stir in the beef stock, 1/2 cup water, and Worcestershire and continue to cook over medium-high heat. In small bowl whisk together the cornstarch, paprika, allspice, parsley, nutmeg, ginger, tomato paste, salt and pepper and 2 tablespoons water. Add to the vegetable mixture.Once the turtle has cooled, put meat in cheesecloth, and tie closed with butcher\\'s twine and add to the pot. The turtle needs to be in cheesecloth so that it can be extracted from the stew before pureeing. Continue to cook over medium-high heat until the mixture boils, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 hours. After 2 hours, remove the turtle in the cheesecloth and strain vegetables from stock. Transfer cooked vegetables to a food processor and process until a chunky paste is achieved. Remove the turtle from cheesecloth and return the meat to saucepan with reserved liquid and pureed vegetables. Cook over medium heat until desired thickness is achieved, about 20 minutes. Ladle into serving bowls and finish with a little sherry in each bowl before serving."

S'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.In a large saute pan, heat the 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil and sear the pork loin on all sides. Transfer pork to a roasting pan and rub with roasted garlic pepper seasoning. Slowly roast in the oven until fork tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow pork loin to rest for 8 to 10 minutes before slicing.While the pork is in the oven, begin the marmalade. In a hot skillet, heat the onions, red peppers and orange peppers (heat them dry with no oil) for about 3 minutes. The idea is to remove the liquid from the onions, by "sweating them down." Add the honey, vinegar, wine, hot sauce and cranberry sauce, and stir well. Reduce over medium-low heat until there is no liquid left in the pan and marmalade mixture is tacky.To make the garlic bread, melt the butter in the extra-virgin olive oil over low heat. Add garlic and gently cook until it begins to soften. Assemble slices of bread on a baking sheet and spoon even amounts of the garlic-oil-butter mixture on each slice. After you have removed the pork from the oven to rest, toast the garlic bread briefly in the oven. Slice down the pork tenderloin, and assemble the appetizer by layering a medallion of pork and a small amount of the marmalade on each piece of garlic toast.'

Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the potatoes to a work surface, flatten into an even round and cut into quarters. Run your fingers under the skin of each chicken breast to separate it from the meat. Place 1/4 of the potatoes under the skin of each breast, gently pressing to evenly distribute.

Rub the mesquite seasoning onto all the chicken parts. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large saute pan, brown the chicken on all sides and place on a baking sheet. Transfer the chicken to the oven and bake until the juices run clear and the chicken is fork tender, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest.While the chicken is in the oven, prepare the tomato demi-glace. Heat the canola oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and saute the red onion, celery and garlic until they begin to caramelize lightly, being careful not to burn them. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, and when most of the alcohol has evaporated, add the vegetables, stock, tomatoes, parsley leaves, and thyme. Return to a gentle boil and let the liquid reduce by half, then strain into a small bowl. Strain the mushrooms through paper towels to reserve the soaking liquid. Use 1/2 cup of the mushroom soaking liquid in a small saucepan to make the sauce by whisking in the demi-glace. Heat for a few minutes to let the flavors integrate. Remove from heat and fold in the mushrooms.Cut the figs in half lengthwise. Arrange the chicken on serving dish, spoon some sauce on top and garnish with figs.'

S'For the sauce: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, sweat the fennel, onions, and carrots in the olive oil. Cook until the vegetables are softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Next, deglaze with the white wine. Once the wine has reduced, add the stock and orange juice. Reduce the heat and allow the liquid to cook until it has reduced by half. Once reduced, add the tomatoes and garlic and allow the sauce to further simmer for 15 minutes. Taste and season. Remove saucepan from the heat, pour through a strainer, and return to the pan. Finish with the butter. Keep warm.For the fish: Season the skin side of the fish fillets with the ground fennel, salt, and pepper, and then season the flesh side with salt and pepper.In the oil in a nonstick saute pan over high heat until it reaches the smoking point. Reduce the heat and add the seasoned fish, skin side down, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, reduce the heat, and continue to cook for 5 to 6 minutes, carefully spooning the hot oil over the fish to keep the skin crisp. Once the fillet is cooked, remove from the pan and serve with the sauce.'

S'Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the crayfish a little at a time so as not to stop the boil, and let cook until pink. Using a slotted spoon remove the crayfish and set aside until they are cool enough to handle. (Skim off and discard any impurities that have risen to the surface of the stock.) Now, remove the shells from the shrimp and add the shells to the pot of chicken stock, reserving the uncooked shrimp on a utility platter. Allow the shrimp shells to cook in the broth until pink, then strain the stock into another container and discard the shells.While the shrimp shells are boiling, heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Brown the sausage and remove to a platter until it is cool enough to handle. In the sausage drippings over medium heat, saute the onion, celery, and green bell pepper until the onion turns translucent. Reduce the heat and whisk in the flour to make a roux, and let cook for about 15 minutes until it becomes a brown roux.While the roux is browning, slice the sausage into 1/4 to 1/2-inch pieces. Put the tomato paste in a small bowl and add some of the warm stock to make a slurry. Gradually whisk the warm stock and the tomato paste into the roux. Add the garlic powder, crushed red pepper, okra, 1 tablespoon parsley, scallions, red bell pepper, tomatoes and sausage. Cook over low heat until the okra - which contains a thickening agent - is tender, about 15 minutes, and the sausage is cooked through. While the mixture is cooking, remove the crayfish from their shells. (This is done by cracking the tail with both hands and forcing it back out through the curve of the tail.) Add the oysters and shrimp to the pot and cook about 5 minutes until the oysters are plump and the shrimp are pink. Stir in crayfish. Remove pot from heat and carefully fold in crab, trying not to break up the lumps.To serve, place some rice on serving dish and spoon some gumbo over. Sprinkle with file powder and garnish with remaining parsley.'

S"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the lasagne noodles.To make the sauce: Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a medium saucepot, saute garlic and onion until the onions become translucent. Add crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer about 20 minutes, checking periodically to make sure the sauce doesn\\'t burn.Boil the lasagne noodles until al dente, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Toss with olive oil so the noodles don\\'t stick together. Let cool.This lasagne will have 4 layers but 2 different types of cheese layers. One cheese layer will consist of mascarpone, ricotta, Parmesan and egg to bind. Combine these 4 ingredients in a bowl and set aside briefly. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Layer 4 to 5 lasagne noodles lengthwise side by side in an ovenproof lasagne dish with edges overlapping. Top with half of the mascarpone/ricotta cheese mixture. (It is easiest to drop evenly spaced spoonfuls of this over the noodles, and then spread it out.)  Distribute half of the fresh basil and half of the fresh oregano over the cheese, then layer another 4 or 5 lasagne noodles over the cheese in the same fashion as the first layer of noodles.The second layer of cheese will consist of provolone and mozzarella. Spread half of the provolone cheese slices over the second layer of noodles and sprinkle with half of the mozzarella. Repeat the process with the noodles, remaining mascarpone/ricotta and noodles for the third layer. For the last layer, spread out the remaining noodles, top with remaining provolone, but then ladle the tomato sauce over and finish with the remaining mozzarella.Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, remove and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil sprigs."

Cover the bowl of dough with a damp kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place for at least 30 minutes.Heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat on the griddle. Form 1 to 2 tablespoons of the dough into 4 to 6-inch disks. (The New Mexican version shown on the episode is thicker than the Latin American version.). Cook on the griddle for 1 or 2 minutes, flip with large pancake turner and cook the other side.Allow to rest than serve warm or at room temperature, or use as needed for the component of another recipe.'

S'For the fig jam: Soak the figs in the red wine for at least 2 hours and preferably overnight.Heat a large saute pan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and add the grapeseed oil, shallots, garlic and rosemary. Saute until the garlic begins to brown slightly on the edges.Add the figs and wine, the balsamic vinegar and brown sugar and bring to a simmer. Simmer the jam until the liquid has reduced by half and is syrupy. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the jam to a food processor and pulse until chunky. Let the jam cool completely.For the sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat.  Add the grapeseed oil and allow it to heat up. Add the diced sweet potatoes, parsnips and carrots and cook on high to sear the potatoes, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook the the vegetables, stirring regularly, until tender, about 20 minutes.Add the chili powder and cayenne and saute for 1 to 2 minutes to toast the spices. Add the honey cook, stirring, to glaze the sweet potatoes, 3 to 4 minutes. The vegetables should be tender but not falling apart.For the lemon vinaigrette: Combine the lemon juice, dijon mustard, honey and garlic in a blender and puree.Slowly add the grapeseed and extra-virgin olive oil while the blender is running to emulsify the dressing. Add the oregano and parsley and let the blender run for a few seconds to mix the vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper. Hold for plating.For the salmon: Season the salmon with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the grapeseed oil and allow it to heat up. Place the salmon in the pan, making sure not to overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary. Sear one side of the salmon until nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the salmon over and finish cooking until medium to medium-well, 2 to 3 minutes.To plate: Just before serving, heat the sweet potato mixture over high heat and add the Brussels sprout leaves. Cook until the leaves are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Divide the root vegetables and Brussels sprouts among 6 plates, placing the vegetables in the center of the plates. Lay the salmon over the vegetables. Drizzle 1 to 2 ounces of the vinaigrette over and around the salmon. Top the salmon with 2 ounces of the fig jam and garnish the plates with the chopped parsley.'

Remove the chicken from the marinade and allow to sit on a baking screen for 5 minutes. This will allow any excess marinade to drip off.Next, in a large bowl, blend the flour, salt and pepper, mixing well. Dredge the marinated chicken in the flour. Coat the chicken well with flour, and then tap off any excess. Add to the heated oil. Fry the chicken in batches until it reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 13 to 15 minutes. Then remove from the oil and allow any excess to drip off before serving. This will allow the meat to rest before serving. Repeat the cooking process with the remaining chicken.

While the pasta is cooking, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and add the onion, cooking until translucent. Add the flour a little at a time to make a roux. Do this gradually because some batches of flour absorb more than others and you may not need as much. Incorporate enough of the chicken broth a little at a time to form a smooth sauce. Simmer for a least 10 minutes to allow the flour to "cook out." Add the heavy cream and Cheddar, then season with salt and white pepper, to taste. Then fold in as much pasta as you need to acquire the right consistency for macaroni and cheese. Transfer to a 3-quart baking dish and sprinkle with crushed crackers. Heat in oven for a few minutes to toast the crackers. Garnish with the reserved whole crackers and serve.'

S'Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Rub the pork loin with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  In a large skillet with oven safe handles, heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat and sear the pork loin on all sides. Cover with foil and roast in the oven until fork tender, about 35 to 45 minutes to 1 hour.  At the 30 minute mark, you will remove the foil and brush some of the mango honey sauce on the pork.Bring 5 cups water to a boil in a saucepan with a lid. Add rice, butter and salt. Return to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and let cook for 20 minutes without removing the lid.After the pork loin has been placed in the oven, begin the mango honey sauce.  In a saucepan, heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat and saute shallot until translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in jalapeno and vinegar and cook for about 1 minute. Add chicken stock and mango juice, bring to a boil. Allow to reduce by 2/3, about 10 minutes. Stir in the honey and allow to thicken, about 2 minutes.  Reserve about 1/2 cup of the sauce in a small bowl, cover and keep warm by immersing in a larger container of hot water.Uncover the pork and brush some of the mango glaze on the pork and allow to caramelize on the surface of the meat in the oven. Remove the rice from the heat and let sit covered for a minutes. Heat the beans over medium heat and keep warm.Remove pork from oven and let rest.Fold the beans into the rice, cover and let rest.  For the shrimp, heat the grapeseed oil over medium heat in a skillet and add the butter to melt. Add the garlic and saute for a couple of minutes, being careful not to burn it. Add the shrimp and cook until just pink and opaque and remove from heat. (Do not overcook the shrimp.)Slice down the pork. Spoon some rice and beans into the center of serving plate. Arrange slices of sliced pork on top and arrange approximately 4 shrimp around. Drizzle with reserved mango sauce.'

Pat the sweetbreads dry with a paper towel and make a pocket in the middle of the sweetbreads big enough to fill. Season the sweetbreads with salt and pepper and fill cavity with stuffing mixture. Heat the grapeseed oil in a medium skillet with an oven safe handle. In a shallow bowl, season flour with salt and pepper and dredge sweetbreads in flour, shaking off excess. Gently transfer sweetbreads to hot skillet and sear for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place the whole pan in the preheated oven to finish. Test for doneness after about 5 more minutes by touching the sweetbreads to see if the interior has "tightened up" enough so it will remain intact when it is sliced. When this point has been reached remove from oven and let rest for about 20 minutes to allow all the flavors to flow back into the sweetbreads and allow it to set up before slicing.'

S'To cook en papillote (in the oven, enclosed in an oven bag or foil), preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place flour in an oven bag and shake to coat the interior. Add cracked pepper and brisket to bag and shake to coat surface of meat with pepper. Place bagged brisket in roasting pan. Add honey mustard, horseradish and 1/2 cup of water and seal bag. Bake for about 45 minutes per pound.On the episode we cooked this dish sous vide, French for "under vacuum," and which applies to cooking vacuum packed foods at a very low temperature of around 140 degrees F usually in liquid. Because of food safety concerns, special equipment is required for true sous vide cooking. If you happen to own one of the appliances which vacuum seals food in plastic bags which are safe for boiling, you may wish to use their "boil-in-bag" method, which is similar to sous vide. However, be sure to follow the manufacturer\\\'s instructions. Alternatively you may wish to use a "faux sous vide" cooking method (done similarly to sous vide, only without a vacuum). To do this you would wrap the ingredients in plastic and immerse them in a court bouillon - the term for a "poaching liquid" consisting of a vegetable broth - and simmer on the stovetop at a low temperature (necessary to avoid melting the plastic) for about 2 hours. (A "simmer" in classical cooking is just below a boil.) While the corned beef is cooking, prepare the honey mustard sauce:Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves and nutmeg in a heavy-gauge, non-corrosive saucepan over medium heat. In a separate pan create a roux by cooking the butter and flour for a few minutes, stirring continuously, without browning, until it emits a nutty aroma. Remove from the heat. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the cooled down roux, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and season, to taste, with salt and white pepper. Whisk in honey mustard and cover with a piece of plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming.Let corned beef rest 10 minutes before carving. Serve slices on open face rye with honey mustard sauce on the side.'

S'Preheat oven to 375 degrees FSeason chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess. Heat half the clarified butter (1/8 cup) in a large saute pan, and brown the chicken on both sides over medium heat, cooking about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to an ovenproof casserole. Add the rest of the clarified butter (the other 1/8 cup) to the same saute pan, and add the tomatoes and chopped basil, cooking gently over low heat for 2 minutes. Then, add the white wine and reduce the liquid by half. When the liquid in the saute pan is reduced, add the vegetable stock and heavy cream and bring to a gentle boil. Let the sauce cook until mixture starts to thicken about 5 to 10 minutes. Pour the sauce directly over the chicken in the casserole and bake covered in the oven until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 25 to 35 minutes.While the chicken is cooking, begin the rice. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepot and saute onion and garlic until translucent. Add rice and toast lightly. Pour in the 5 cups of chicken stock and add the poultry seasoning and season with salt and pepper. Return to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes, keeping covered at all times.  When the chicken is done, transfer the pieces to a utility platter. The chicken should still have sauce on top. You can spoon some more sauce on top of the chicken if desired, but most of the remaining sauce in the casserole will be used for the rice. Finish the rice by adding the tomato/basil sauce and combining well. Spoon the rice onto center of serving plate, top with a piece of chicken and garnish with basil.'

S'Rinse beef shoulder to remove any residue, pat dry with paper towels and place on a utility platter. In a small bowl, make the rub for the beef by combining Smokey Rotisserie Seasoning and Garlic Pepper. Rub the seasonings into all surfaces of the beef, cover with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours at room temperature. (The seasonings will actually begin to "cure" the meat.)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.In an oven proof skillet heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat, add onion and garlic and cook until they begin to soften. Add beef and sear it on all sides. Cover pan (with lid or foil) and transfer to oven to finish beef, bringing to an internal temperature of 115 degrees F for medium rare (about 30 minutes). Remove from oven, transfer to a utility platter, and let rest for 10 minutes. (Make the sauce as directed below while the beef is resting.)While the beef is in the oven, make the onion rings. Combine flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. In another smaller bowl, whisk together oil, milk, egg and black pepper. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and combine until all dry ingredients are moistened. Heat oil to 375 degrees F in a deep-fryer. Add the onion rings to the bowl of fritter batter. Using tongs, transfer batter-coated onion rings to the deep-fryer basket, deep-fry in hot oil until golden brown and drain. Keep in a warm place.For the sauce: To the pan in which the beef was roasting (use an oven mitt on the hot handle), add 1 cup water and balsamic vinegar over medium high heat and whisk in instant flour. Allow to cook for about 5 minutes to "cook out" the flour. Strain into a bowl and whisk in gorgonzola cheese, allowing it to melt. Season with pepper, to taste, and salt only if needed (as the cheese will lend saltiness).Slice beef into steaks, and transfer to serving dish. Spoon cheese sauce over meat and top with onion rings.'

S'Heat the 3 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan, and saute the garlic and shallots over a gentle heat until translucent. (If you have any trimmings of meat, you would add them at this time). Deglaze the pan with the wine, and add the beef stock and the thyme and rosemary. Allow this mixture to reduce. It could take 20 to 30 minutes (sometimes longer) at a rolling boil, uncovered. You want the liquid to evaporate to about 1/3 of what you started with (in order to intensify the flavor). Once you have reduced the liquid to the required volume, remove from the heat, strain through a chinois (a conical strainer) or some cheesecloth (so you can remove all the vegetables and herbs), return the sauce to the pan and stir in the butter to finish the sauce. Allow to rest in a warm place.For the potatoes:Boil the potatoes with the bay leaves until the potatoes are tender. While the potatoes are cooking, saute lobster meat in oil and butter until it is no longer translucent, and set aside. Drain the potatoes well and discard the bay leaves, then mash the potatoes. Using a beater, add in 1 stick of butter and salt and white pepper. Fold the lobster meat into the potatoes and set aside in a warm place.For the filet mignon:Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Season beef with salt and pepper. In a heavy bottomed, oven-safe saute pan, add just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and heat on medium high heat on the stovetop. When the saute pan is hot, cook each side of the filets for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, leaving undisturbed for the first 2 minutes or so. Turn the filets and continue the searing process on the other side of the filets for another 2 to 3 minutes. Place the pan of steaks into the preheated oven. Allow the filets to cook a further 6 to 8 minutes in the oven (depending on the thickness of the steaks and the heat of your oven).While the steaks are in the oven finish the potatoes by crumbling the Boursin cheese into the lobster mashed potatoes which you have been keeping warm and gently stirring it in to allow cheese to melt. Remove the pan of steaks from oven and allow them to rest. (Remember to use an oven mitt; the handle of the pan will be hot!)If necessary, briefly re-heat the Merlot sauce, then remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the whole stick of butter.Plate a portion of mashed potatoes in the center of serving plate. Top with the filet mignon, spoon the Merlot sauce over and around and garnish with chopped chives.'

Then trace the cornstarch paste around the edges of the wrapper. To seal, fold the bottom tip over the filling, and then bring the left and right sides into the center. To finish, simply roll to bring  the top until the roll is closed.Drop the spanakopita rolls into the fryer. Lower them slowly into the oil so they set.  Once crisp, after about 2 minutes, remove from the fryer. Remember they will continue to cook two shades darker.

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Peel all the potatoes and, as you peel them, put them in a large container with 1 gallon water and the lemon juice to keep them from browning. Once they are all peeled, remove them from the water and pat dry. Then slice the potatoes about 1/4-inch apart and about three-quarters of the way through to create a series of uniform slices so that they are still joined together at the bottom. This should create a fan type finish to the potatoes.Next, using a whisk, blend the butter, parsley, salt and pepper. Make sure to mix well. Dunk the potatoes into the butter mixture, making sure that the slits in the potato soak up the mixture as well. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, remove the potatoes, re-heat any remaining butter and drizzle on top. Divide the cheese mixture over the potatoes.  Bake the potatoes until the cheese is melted and the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Once melted, remove the potatoes and serve.'

S'Soak the rice stick noodles in tepid water for about 15 minutes. Remove them to a cutting board and cut into 4-inch pieces then place in a strainer to let all water drain off, and set aside.Coat the bottom of an omelette pan with a small amount of oil and pour off excess. Beat the eggs together and add to pan forming a thin layer, and cook as you would a thin omelette. Remove from heat and chop cooked egg roughly and set aside, keeping warm until ready to serve.Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a wok or large skillet and add garlic, onion, and red and green peppers, and cook for 2 minutes. One at a time, add the ground peanut, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar and pepper powder, stirring the mixture the entire time. (Note: chicken, shrimp, or tofu can be added to this dish at the saute stage.) Add the noodles and be sure to stir! The noodles tend to burn if not continuously stirred. Check to see if the taste of the dish is suitable to you, if not, then add in either fish sauce or soy sauce (both salty), or sugar (sweet). (Here is where a matter of preference comes into play.) To serve, place the noodle mixture on a plate, top with cooked egg and garnish with bean sprouts, peanuts and cilantro.'

This will help you remove the skin from the pepper.In a small bowl, mix jack cheese, goat cheese, thyme, rosemary, and sage, and mash together.Peel charred skin from peppers and stuff each pepper with about 2 tablespoons of the cheese/herb mixture. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Spread blue cornmeal on a piece of waxed paper and roll stuffed peppers to coat with cornmeal. Sear coated peppers on all sides, leaving undisturbed for the first 2 minutes to allow the cornmeal to integrate into the surface of the peppers and to allow the caramelization process to begin to prevent crusting off of the cornmeal.Transfer to a platter and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.'

S"Chef\\'s Note: You can replace the turmeric and masala powder with curry powderIn a large cooking pot, heat the oil and add the chopped onions, frying until golden brown. Stir in the turmeric and masala powder (or curry powder), garlic and chiles, mix well and cook for a couple of minutes to integrate flavors. Add the lamb and sear on all sides. Sprinkle the flour over the meat using a sifting motion, spoon in tomato paste, then gradually add the stock (or water) stirring constantly while doing so. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer over low heat until meat is tender, about 1 hour. Check the pot often and stir so the curry doesn\\'t burn. If the sauce is thickening too fast during this cooking time, add water to retain the consistency and to prevent burning. (If you prefer, once you have added the stock or water and the sauce is a good smooth consistency, you may transfer to a covered roasting pan and finish in the oven at 350 degrees F until the meat is tender.) In the last 30 minutes of cooking time, stir in the potatoes.While the lamb curry is in its last 1/2 hour, bring 5 cups of water to a boil, add rice and salt, reduce heat, cover and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit 5 minutes.Spoon rice onto serving plate, top with lamb curry and garnish with fresh cilantro."

S'Prepare the vinaigrette, just before use. Place the lemons in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since these will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set them aside briefly, until they cool just enough to handle. Pour vinegar into a blender, turn it on, and then squeeze in 1emon juice from the micro-waved lemons. Leaving the blender running, add 1 at a time through the feed opening: garlic, mustard, chives, basil, Parmesan, and pepper and blend until smooth. While keeping the blender running, add oil through the feed opening in a slow stream. Set aside until needed.In a large mixing bowl combine kidney beans, chick peas, green beans, artichoke hearts, and black olives. Dress with enough vinaigrette to coat well, then gently fold in pasta, scallops, shrimp, tuna, peas, and grape tomatoes. Taste and adjust dressing as needed. Do not feel compelled to use all of the dressing. You want enough to complement the ingredients of the salad without overcoming their flavors. (You can always serve dressing on the side, or add more to the salad if you wish. The pasta will absorb some of the vinaigrette.)Transfer to serving bowls or serve family style. Garnish with basil sprigs and shaved Parmesan.'

S'Season the steaks with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Tenderize steaks with meat mallet to break down the muscle and integrate spices into the meat. Place them in a bowl and pour 1/2 cup of the wine over them, letting them marinate, for a minimum of 25 minutes.Prepare demi-glace by melting the butter over medium heat in a saucepan and sauteing onion until tender. Whisk in flour with a fork to make a roux, then add 1/2 cup red wine and veal stock. Let simmer over medium heat until reduced by 1/3, stirring occasionally.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, coat potatoes with 1/2 cup of the canola oil and toss with 2 tablespoons salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, fresh thyme, and fresh rosemary. Place the potatoes in a baking pan and roast them in the oven until tender, about 35 to 45 minutes.In a hot skillet, heat the onions (heat them dry with no oil) for about 3 minutes. The idea is to remove the liquid from the onions, by "sweating them down." Add the honey, vinegar, remaining 1/2 cup wine, hot sauce and grape jelly, and stir well. Reduce over medium low heat until there is no liquid left in the pan and marmalade mixture is tacky.When the potatoes have been roasting for about 1/2 hour, heat 1/4 cup canola oil in a saute pan. Sear both sides of the steak in the hot pan until golden brown, but do not cook beyond medium, or the steak may become tough. To finish the demi-glace, remove from heat and whisk the butter into the warm reduction. Arrange potatoes around the meat and top meat with marmalade. Drizzle with demi-glace sauce.'

S'Husk corn, discarding the silk. Place corn husks in a large pot and pour boiling water over them, and allow to soak for 30 minutes. Drain and pat dry, leaving moist but not wet.Cut the kernels from the corn to equal about 1 1/2 cups. Of this amount, puree 1 cup of the kernels in a food processor and leave the other kernels whole. Set aside.For the ground beef:Heat olive oil and saute onion until translucent. Add ground beef, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, celery salt, and salt and pepper, and cook until browned. Drain off extra fat and divide into even amounts per the number of tamales you will be making.For the filling:Combine cornmeal, salt, and 1 cup water in a mixing bowl. Bring another 1 cup of water to a boil and stir in cornmeal mixture, stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat and whisk in butter, baking powder, pureed corn, whole corn kernels, and jalapeno.The tamales are eaten directly from the corn husk casings in which they are steamed. To make tamale casings for steaming: Tear corn husks into strips. Some of these will be woven together and should be at least an inch wide. You will also need about 16 narrower strips (1/4 to 1/2 inch wide) to secure the ends of the tamales.  Lay 4 strips or so side by side, and then weave another 4 or so through in a perpendicular fashion to make 8 rectangles about 8 inches square. Each tamale will be filled with even amounts of the corn mixture, beef mixture and cheese. Spoon some of the corn mixture (between 2 and 4 tablespoons) into the center of each tamale case and spread to make a layer. Then spoon an even amount of the ground beef mixture into the center of corn mixture on each tamale. Top beef mixture with even amounts of cheese on each tamale. At this point, begin 1 or 2 pans of boiling water, each fitted with a steaming rack (You will need enough steaming space over the pans to accommodate the tamales.) Fold the corn husks so the corn filling encases the meat filling and cheese. Secure the ends of the tamales casings by tying shut with pieces of corn husk. Place tamales on racks and steam - covered - for about 20 minutes to a half hour, replenishing water in pan(s) as needed. Let rest briefly before serving.'

Prepare a rub by combining Roasted Garlic Pepper Seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, lemon pepper, and salt in a small bowl and rubbing over entire surface of spare ribs. Follow manufacturer\\'s instructions for the smoker. General rule of thumb is to maintain a temperature range of 255 to 300 degrees F (indirect heat), and smoke for 1 to 1 1/2 hours per pound of meat (probably about 4 1/2 hours or so for sides of pork spare ribs). Towards the end of the smoking time, combine the honey and brown sugar in a small bowl and spread on the spare ribs.Serve family style."

S"Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sour cream, milk, eggs, salt and melted butter. Bake in a greased loaf pan for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown and when a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Let cool in pan.Let oven temperature reduce to 400 degrees F.For the Turkey:Rinse turkey breast and pat dry with paper towels. Slip chunks of butter under the skin. Season turkey breast with garlic powder, salt and pepper, to taste, and roast in 400 degrees F oven until it reaches an internal temperature of about 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.For the Dressing:Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute sausage until browned. Remove to a utility platter with a slotted spoon and pour most of the fat from the pan leaving about 1 tablespoon. Melt butter in the skillet over medium heat. Saute onion, garlic, celery, parsley, sage and thyme until onion is translucent, being careful not to burn them. Remove from heat and set aside briefly. Cut cornbread into cubes or break it up with your hands into a large bowl (depending on the texture you like). Spoon the sauteed vegetables and herbs over the cornbread. Stir or use your hands to combine well and add enough chicken stock to moisten. Transfer to a baking pan and place in the oven until crispy on the outside, for approximately the last 25 minutes of the turkey\\'s roasting time. Remove from oven and transfer to a serving dish in a warm place.For the Gravy:When turkey is done, remove breast to a platter to let rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Skim most of the fat from the pan juices, reserving 1/3 cup of the fat. Add wine to the remaining pan juices and cook over medium-high heat until reduced by half. In a separate saucepan, heat reserved 1/3 cup of fat and whisk in flour over moderately-low heat for a few minutes to make a roux. Add chicken stock and reduced wine, continuing to cook until gravy simmers.Slice turkey and arrange on plate. Serve with cornbread dressing and gravy."

S"For the pesto: In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, pulse the basil and mint 3 to 4 times or until chopped, then add the pine nuts and salt and pulse an additional 2 to 3 times. Add the garlic and cheese, pulse 2 times. With the food processor running, slowly add the oil to blend, this should take 1 minute. Don\\'t over-pulse or puree; this will result in a brown liquid sauce, not a bright herb pesto.For the pork: To butterfly the pork, place each loin on a cutting board and slice lengthwise through the center, about 3 inches deep, but not cutting all the way through, until it opens to form a 10 by 10-inch square.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Season the inside of both loins with salt and pepper and evenly spread the pesto, leaving a 2-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle with feta and top with spinach. Roll tightly lengthwise. With butchers twine, tie several knots around the stuffed loins, 4 to 5 times, to ensure even cooking.Heat the oil in a heavy bottomed saute pan over high heat, season the outside of the loins with salt and pepper, and sear on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and place the loins on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing and serving."

S'For the sauce: In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the butter until melted. Then stir in the flour, stirring through the process, until light brown and smooth. Next, add the milk, again stir and allow the roux to absorb the milk. Then season with the salt and white pepper and add the parsley. This process should take 4 to 5 minutes. Hold the sauce warm.For the steaks: Preheat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. With a meat tenderizer, pound the steaks until double in size and 1/4-inch thick. Add the salt and black pepper to the flour. Then dredge a steak in the flour, then the egg wash and finally again in the flour. Repeat the process with all the steaks. Then drop them in the fryer and cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and finish until golden brown, a final 2 minutes. Remove from the fryer and allow any excess oil to drip off on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.To serve, portion the potatoes, and then top with 4 pieces asparagus, then steak and finish with the sauce to the side of the steak and serve.'

Place the peppers in a roasting pan and roast in preheated oven, checking every 15 minutes, and turning them with tongs until the skin is fully wrinkled and charred black.  White the peppers are roasting, boil tortellini until al dente, drain, and set aside to cool. Put the charred peppers into a bowl filled with a couple of inches of ice water. Once cooled, you can then use your fingers to work quickly to slip off and discard the skins of the peppers while they are in the water. Transfer them to a plate, peel away any remnants of the charred skins, slice open and remove the stem and seeds, then julienne the peppers and set aside.Through the feed opening of a running blender, add scallions, garlic cloves, sun-dried tomatoes, and 1/2 cup of the fresh basil leaves (packed), reserving the rest of the basil. Add the vinegar and blend until a paste is formed, then leaving the blender running, add the olive oil in a slow steady stream allowing the mixture to emulsify. Season the dressing with salt and pepper, to taste.Julienne the rest of the basil (except for the sprigs for garnish).  Toss with the tortellini, julienned red bell peppers, and dressing. Transfer to serving dish and decorate with reserved basil sprigs. Can be served at room temperature or chilled.'

S'Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, make a paste with garlic, shallots, salt, pepper and enough of the canola oil to bind the paste (about 1/4 cup).  Place the beef in a roasting pan and rub paste onto meat. Roast in oven for about 1 1/2 hours, or until an instant-read thermometer registers an internal temperature of 120 degrees F.  (Arrange the oven racks so you will have room for the potatoes and asparagus to follow.) While roast is in oven, prepare demi-glace by melting the butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan and sauteing the onion until tender. Whisk in flour with a fork to make a roux, then add red wine and veal stock. Let simmer over medium heat for about 1 hour, until reduced by 1/3, stirring occasionally. In a large bowl, coat potatoes with about 1/2 cup of the remaining canola oil and toss with salt, pepper, fresh thyme, and fresh rosemary. When the roast has been cooking for about 1 hour, place the potatoes in a baking pan and put into the oven. Place the asparagus in a single layer on another baking pan. When the potatoes have been roasting for 30 minutes, drain the oil and herbs from the potatoes and pour over the asparagus. Remove the roast, if done, and allow to rest for about 15 minutes. Return the potatoes to the oven, along with the asparagus. Roast the vegetables until tender, about another 15 minutes while the rib roast is resting. To finish the demi-glace, whisk butter into the warm reduction until combined. Slice the rib roast and arrange on a large platter. Arrange the potatoes and asparagus around the meat, drizzling demi-glace sauce on the meat.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.For the beef filling, sprinkle the slices with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the beef and cook until cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes. During this time, stir and shred the beef with tongs or a spatula. The beef should be a shredded cheese steak consistency. Once cooked, remove from the heat and allow to cool until building the stromboli.On a clean, dry work surface sprinkled with flour, roll the pizza dough into a 10 by 14-inch rectangle, making sure not to flip the dough over, just rotating by 90 degrees as needed. Once the dough is rolled out, sprinkle half the cheese in the center, leaving a 2-inch border on all sides. Top with the beef, followed by the tomato sauce, in a stacked fashion. Top with the herbs and the remaining cheese. Brush the edges with some of the egg wash. Fold the bottom and top edges over the filling, and then fold the sides over twice, 1-inch at a time, resulting in a 6 by 14-inch tube. Brush the outside of the stromboli with the remaining egg wash, place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and bake until firm and golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut into 5 to 6 portions and serve.'

(The seasonings will actually begin to "cure" the meat.)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.In an ovenproof skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat, and sear all sides of beef. Cover pan (with lid or foil) and transfer to oven to finish cooking, bringing to an internal temperature of 115 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 minutes.While the beef is in the oven, heat remaining oil over medium-high heat and cook the onions until they are translucent. Add the mushrooms and cook until they soften and begin to give up their juices. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.Remove beef from oven and let rest to carryover cook to an internal temperature of 132 degrees F for medium-rare, about 10 to 15 minutes.Slice beef into steaks, and transfer to serving dish. Top with onion and mushrooms.'

S'Heat canola oil over medium-high in a large saute pot. Add onion and garlic and saute until the onions begin to turn translucent. While they are cooking, season the flour with salt and pepper and coat the oxtails, allowing any excess flour to fall away. Sear the oxtails on both sides in the pot with the onions and garlic, then remove them to a utility platter. De-glaze the pan with the red wine. Whisk in demi-glace and tomato paste and add bay leaf, parsley and thyme. Lower heat and return oxtails to pot. Cover and let simmer until meat is tender (it should easily fall away from bone), about 3 hours. Remove oxtails to a platter, cover, and let rest in a warm place. Strain braising liquid into another pot to make it into a sauce. Spoon off any excess fat that may be on the surface. Increase heat, allowing the braising liquid to reduce by one-half to two thirds.Combine the Gremolata ingredients and set aside.While the sauce is reducing, prepare the toasted French bread. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the olive oil on the bread and sprinkle with garlic powder. Lightly toast in the oven.Remove the reduced sauce from the heat and whisk in the butter. Spoon sauce over oxtails and top with a small amount of gremolata. Serve with toasted French garlic bread.'

S"Remove the giblets from the turkey, wash the turkey well, and pat dry with paper towels.Use your fingertips to gently separate the turkey skin from the breast. Mix the chopped herbs with the softened butter and distribute evenly underneath the turkey skin. This will create a self basting turkey and keep it moist as it cooks slowly.Preheat oven to 450 or 500 degrees F. Place the chopped onion, celery, apples, oranges, and carrots inside the cavity of the turkey and then sprinkle the turkey all over with salt and pepper, to taste. Place the turkey on a rack (the reason we place the turkey onto a rack is so we don\\'t get a mushy bottom on the turkey) in a roasting tray, cover with aluminum foil, and place in a preheated oven at 450 to 500 degrees F for the first 25 minutes then reduce the heat to 325 degrees F for a further 4 hours checking every 20 to 30 minutes throughout the day. About 1 hour from finishing remove the foil and allow to get golden brown.You should roast the turkey until an instant-read thermometer registers 180 degrees F (this is the temperature for a whole turkey) and the juices no longer run pink when you cut into the center of the thigh (it should be clear). The drumstick should move easily from the socket when lifted or twisted. When the turkey has finished cooking remove from oven and let it rest for at least 30 minutes - longer is better. It will not go cold!!!Note: I personally don\\'t like to baste because every time you open the oven you lose at least 25 degrees F of heat, so this means that you keep the turkey in the oven longer therefore drying it out."

Transfer to a plate to rest and top with the butter, letting it melt over the chicken. Reserve.For the red wine feta sauce: Put the wine in a small saucepan and cook until reduced by almost half. Add the demi-glace and reduce until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and whisk in the melted butter from the chicken plate. Fold in the feta and season with salt and pepper.To serve: Spoon some sweet potato mash in the center of each plate, making a well in the middle. Spoon some kale in the well of the sweet potato mash.

S'Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat to the verge of smoking. Next, mix the salt and pepper evenly into the flour and coat both sides of each fillet of fish. Then add to the pan, cooking until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and repeat on the second side until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with each fillet, holding the cooked fillets warm, covered with foil on a plate, until serving. Additional oil may be needed during the process.After searing the fish, add the wine to the pan to deglaze. Allow the wine to reduce by half, 3 to 4 minutes, then add the stock and reduce by three-quarters volume, resulting in 1 cup sauce. This reduction will take 4 to 5 minutes. Then add the mushrooms, herbs and garlic. Stir and allow to finish, reducing by half again, a final 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter until creamy. Finish the fillets with the pan sauce and serve.'

Add the chops and allow to brine for 3 hours and up to 24 hours under refrigeration. (The longer the chops are brined the more salt and fruit flavor will be absorbed.)For the pork: In large saute pan over high heat, add the oil, allow to warm until on the verge of smoking and then add 3 chops to the pan. Reduce the heat and cook for 6 to 7 minutes per side, this should yield a golden brown chop. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 chops. Hold warm until servingFor the hash: Return the same pan to medium-high heat and add the oil and the potatoes. Stir the potatoes until softened and browned on the edges, this will take 6 to 8 minutes. Once the potatoes are cooked, add the onions, season with the salt and pepper and continue to cook until the onions have softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Finally, reduce the heat to medium, add the apples and finish cooking for a final 4 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the heat and serve with hot sauce if desired.Cook\\'s Note: The chops can be finished in a preheated 375 degree F oven until reaching 160 degrees F."

S'To prepare the rolls, open the buns and spread the butter evenly on interior of the buns. Toast the buns on a flat pan or saute pan until golden brown. For the fish, preheat the fryer to 350 degrees F with grapeseed oil.Next pat dry the portioned fish on all sides with paper towels. Then sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper evenly. Next dip the fish in the flour and tap off the excess flour. Then dip the fish into the egg wash. Finish the fish in the panko, ensuring to coat evenly. Repeat the process for the remaining fish portions, then carefully drop the coated fish in the fryer. Cook until golden brown on both sides, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from the fryer and place on paper towels to remove excess oil.Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper and heat in a saute pan over medium-high heat, 1 minute per side. To build the sandwich, stack the bun with the remoulade, grilled tomatoes and caramelized onions. Finish with a portion of fish and finally top with the top half of the bun. Repeat for the remaining sandwiches.'

S'Heat the grill. Place the peppers on the grill until the skins are charred then, using tongs, transfer them to a plastic bag to rest and peel them when cool.Place the whole fillet on a utility platter, brush with melted butter, and season with salt and pepper. Sear filet on all sides on hot part of the grill. Move to indirect for medium rare. Alternatively you can sear the fillet in a pan with oven safe handles and transfer pan to a preheated 425 degree F oven for about 30 minutes to reach the same internal temperature. Allow meat to rest before slicing. (On the episode we skewered the beef tenderloins on the sterilized shafts of old golf clubs, grilled them on the skewer, and sliced servings right off the skewer. If you have a rotisserie skewer, you can do something similar.) In the blender, combine the peeled peppers with the scallions, garlic, cilantro, and lime juice. Blend these until a smooth consistency is achieved then, with the blender running, pour the olive oil in a thin stream through the feed opening. Add salt and pepper, to taste.Slice bread in half lengthwise, brush with oil, and season with garlic powder. Grill briefly, cut side down.Serve slices of fillet with sauce spooned over or on the side with slices of the bread as an accompaniment.'

Lay out sheet of dough, lightly butter with pastry brush. Fold sheet in half, butter again. Keep buttering and folding in half (probably 3 "folds" total) until you have a rectangle with dimensions close to 4 by 4-inches. Cut into 3 sections. Sprinkle Parmesan on each piece of dough. Crumble a bit of brie on each. Lay asparagus tip on top and roll dough around asparagus. The tip of the asparagus should show out of the end. Repeat to make 16 pieces. Lay all pieces out on a cookie sheet. Brush each piece with butter and bake in oven until golden brown. Serve warm.'

S'Dissolve salt and sugar in 1 1/2 cups warm water that is between 100 and 120 degrees F. (Warm water is needed to activate the yeast, but if it is too hot, it will kill the yeast. Use a candy thermometer to test the temperature.) Stir in entire contents of packet of yeast and allow the mixture to "form a head" (like on a beer), which takes about 15 minutes.Place flour into mixing bowl and add yeast mixture. Stir to combine and then knead until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Knead for a few minutes so the dough becomes elastic. Cover bowl with a clean cloth and allow to rise and rest for 30 minutes. Then punch the dough down, knead again briefly, cover the bowl with the cloth and allow to rise a second time. For the filling:Heat the olive oil in a saute pan and cook onion until it begins to caramelize. Add garlic and sliced pepper, and cook until they soften. Add pieces of sausage allowing them to brown. Pour off fat and stir in tomato sauce and Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper. Cook together for a few minutes to allow flavors to blend, then remove from heat and set aside briefly.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. On a floured surface, stretch the dough into a 14-inch circle which is thicker around the edges. Transfer to a lightly greased 11-inch pie pan and shake cornmeal over the dough. Spoon the tomato/sausage mixture into the dough and sprinkle mozzarella over the top. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the pie sets up, about 10 to 15 minutes. Serve immediately.'

S'Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the canola oil and butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter melts, add the carrots, sweet potatoes, white mushrooms, zucchini, and peppers, and stir to coat. Cook until the mushrooms give up their juices, season with salt and pepper, and roast in the oven until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove and let cool to room temperature. While the vegetables are roasting, begin the sauce. Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves, nutmeg, thyme, parsley stems, and mint stems in a heavy-gauge, non-corrosive saucepan over medium heat. In a separate pan create a roux by cooking the butter and flour for a few minutes, stirring continuously, without browning, until it emits a nutty aroma, and then remove from the heat. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the roux, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat, strain and whisk in yogurt and Parmesan cheese. Season, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Place a piece of plastic wrap on the surface and set aside.Roll out the pastry dough and, using an appropriately sized cereal bowl or small mixing bowl as a template, cut 6 rounds 8-inches in diameter.Fold roasted vegetables into the sauce and spoon the mixture evenly into 6 individual ovenproof 6-inch bowls (onion soup bowls are ideal for this), and brush the edges of the bowls with egg. Top each with a circle of pastry, draping the crust over the rim. Brush the tops of the pastry with the egg wash and bake at 400 degrees F until golden, about 12 to 15 minutes.'

S'In a large skillet, cook bacon over low heat until crisp. Remove bacon and set aside to drain.  Add onion, celery, and sage to the bacon fat rendered in the skillet, and cook until onions are translucent and celery is soft, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add sage and broken-up bread to the skillet. Stir in parsley, butter, oysters, salt, and pepper. Lightly toss stuffing, but mix well, and let cool.Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F.Butterfly the turkey breast with smooth side down and stuff, folding edges over to hold stuffing. (You may want to secure with skewers or cotton kitchen twine.) Season turkey breast with salt and pepper and place into the oven to roast until it reaches an internal temperature of about 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.While turkey is in oven, place the turkey neck and giblets in a medium saucepan with 4 cups water and cook until you have about 1 cup of giblet stock. Reserve the neck and giblets, removing meat from neck when cool enough to handle and chopping giblets. When turkey is done, remove breast to a platter to let rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Skim most of the fat from the pan juices, reserving 1/3 cup of the fat. Add the wine to the remaining pan juices and cook over medium high heat until reduced by half. In a separate saucepan, heat reserved 1/3 cup of fat and whisk in flour over moderately low heat for a few minutes to make a roux. Add stock and wine reduction, continuing to cook until gravy simmers. Add reserved cooked and chopped giblets and neck meat. Slice turkey to reveal stuffed interior and arrange on plate. Serve with gravy.'

S'Make the aioli and begin marinating the tuna early in the day. Microwave the lemon and lime in a small bowl to release the essential oils and set aside just long enough to be able to handle. Meanwhile, through the feed tube of a running blender, add 1 at a time, the egg yolks, dry mustard, salt, and white pepper. By this time, the micro-waved lemon and lime should be cool enough to handle. Leaving the blender running, squeeze the juice from half of 1 lemon through the feed opening, then add the oil in a slow stream. Remove to a bowl and refrigerate.Season the tuna steaks with salt and pepper, place them in a nonreactive container and squeeze the rest of the lemon and the lime over them. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.Heat the grill or preheat the broiler in the oven. Brush the marinated tuna with 1 tablespoon or so of olive oil.  Cook until browned, until fish flakes with a fork, 3 to 6 minutes per side, and then let rest. Leave grill hot or oven on to toast bread.Brush olive oil (about 1 tablespoon per half) on Italian bread and toast lightly, either on the grill or under broiler.Flake the tuna, place in a bowl with scallions and fennel and fold in the aioli. Spoon tuna mixture onto the toasted Italian bread, drizzle a small amount of balsamic vinegar over, and top with Cheddar. Heat briefly in the oven to melt cheese. Garnish with fresh dill. This is great served with fresh tomato soup, if desired.'

Remove the beans and foil, then spread the butter on the interior of the crust.For the filling: Peel, core and slice the apples. Arrange the slices in a ring pattern, starting on the outer edge and going into the center (the apples should be arranged to allow for even cooking).In a bowl, blend the sugar, melted butter, cinnamon and nutmeg and then pour over the arranged apples.For the topping: In a separate bowl, blend by hand the  flour, sugar and butter. This should be a crumbly looking mixture.Bake the tart until the apples have softened, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and dollop with the sweet butter topping, then return to the oven until the topping has crusted, about 15 minutes.

Cover and keep warm.For the salad: Bring a saucepan of salted cold water to a boil. Blanch the haricot verts until just tender and still bright green. Drain well.Whisk together the vinegar, Dijon mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. While whisking, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Taste and season, if needed.Toss the haricot verts with the vinaigrette and remaining salad ingredients to coat well. Taste and season with salt, if needed. Set aside.For the veal: Pound the cutlets into thin, even pieces between 2 sheets of plastic. Place the flour in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the veal in the seasoned flour.Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil to the hot pan.Saute the veal until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Cook in batches, adding more butter and oil, if needed. Transfer each cooked cutlet to a plate lined with paper towels. Season each piece with salt.For serving: Spoon some of the mashed potatoes into middle of the plates, top each with a veal cutlet, and arrange some of the salad on the side of the veal. Spoon a small amount of lemon sauce on each piece of veal.'

Cut all the potatoes, cold water rinse and dry over paper towels.Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep fryer.Next blanch the fries until the exterior starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the fryer and let air dry, then refrigerate on baking pans. Fries need to cool 1 one hour in cooler before stacking in storage pans.Return the oil to 350 degrees. Drop 10 fries per order, cooking until crisp golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the basket, allow any excess oil to drip, then season with salt and pepper.'

S'In a medium saucepan, heat the milk, heavy cream, vanilla bean or extract, and half the sugar to a simmer (just below a boil). In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar and temper it by adding a small amount of the heated milk mixture to the bowl while whisking constantly (known as a liaison). Now pour the liaison (egg mixture) into the milk pot, stirring constantly. You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook. The idea is to avoid making scrambled eggs! Continue cooking on medium heat until the mixture begins to thicken so it will coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.In a large skillet, saute the apples and bananas in the butter and add cinnamon and lime juice and stir to coat. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and allow to cook until apples are tender and caramel colored, about 20 to 25 minutes and let cool.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees FFor the crumb topping, using a wooden spoon, mix oatmeal, flour, sugar and butter until the mixture resembles bread crumbs.Combine the now cooled apples with the cream, pour into the pie shell and top with oatmeal mixture. Bake until crust is completely baked and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Heat maple syrup as an accompaniment, and serve.'

S"Grease a 2-quart baking dish with butter. Spread the cubed baked goods evenly in the prepared baking dish. Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it is scalding. In a separate small saucepan, heat the apricots and cranberries with the liqueur (or water) and let simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the dried fruits begin to soften. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add the hot milk, a small amount at a time, to the egg mixture and whisk together (known as a liaison) to temper the mixture by combining gently and gradually without cooking the eggs. Spread the apricots and raisins evenly over the bread in the baking dish, the pour the liaison into the baking dish, distributing evenly.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Let the baking dish stand for about 20 minutes to allow the liquid to absorb into the cubed baked goods.Prepare a bain marie by placing the baking dish into a larger pan or dish, placing the arrangement into the preheated oven, and then pouring hot water into the outer dish (without splashing any into the custard dish). Bake until the pudding firms up and puffs up and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and from water bath and let rest 10 minutes. Serve warm or cooled.While the bread pudding is baking, prepare the cold fruit soup. To a blender add strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, peeled banana, peach and lemon juice. Blend until smooth and strain into a bowl. Return strained fruit to blender and add softened frozen yogurt, blending to combine. Serve as a topping to the Queen\\'s Bread Custard, in demitasse cups as an accompaniment, or by itself as an independent dessert soup."

S'For the pork: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Portion the pork butt in two equal sections around 1 pound each. Next, in a small bowl, blend the salt, cayenne, black pepper and cumin, mixing well. Then pat dry the pork and rub the exterior with the mixed seasonings. Once rubbed with the seasoning, place in a deep roasting pan. Add the cut vegetables and finish with the stock, then cover with foil. After covering, bake until softened, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.After roasting, remove from the oven, place the pork on a sheet pan and allow cooling. Skim any fat from the stock and reserve. After cooling, pull the meat for burritos, and then place the stock in a saucepot, warming over medium-high heat. Then puree with a stick blender to a create a sauce. Once pureed, taste and re-season if preferred. Then remove from the stovetop and place in a container to cool.For the rice: Place the stock in a saucepan and warm over high heat. Once hot, add the annatto seed and stir until dissolved. Then remove from the stove and pour over the raw rice in a 2-inch deep baking pan. Add the cilantro and jalapenos, cover with foil and place in the oven until cooked, about 30 minutes. All liquids should be absorbed for the rice to be cooked.For the burritos: To build the burritos, in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add the pork and 1 cup reserved puree, stirring while warming for 4 to 5 minutes. Then add the cilantro, salt, pepper and lemon juice and warm. Then reduce the heat to low and keep the pork hot.Next, lay a tortilla flat and add in the center section 1 cup warmed pork, 1/4 cup rice, 2 tablespoons beans and 1 tablespoon cheese. Fold the bottom edge of the tortilla to meet, and then pull the sides over covering one another. Next, in a separate pan or on griddle, add 1 teaspoon reserved pork fat and heat over medium heat and allow to warm. Add the burrito and sear on the first side until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes, and then repeat on the second side until browned. Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and filling.'

S"In a large Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat until it begins to glisten. Stir in the onions, garlic, carrots, celery and fresh rosemary, and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the mutton and stir until all sides of the meat have browned. Add the wine and tomato paste and allow to cook for about 10 minutes. Then add the vegetable stock or water, reduce heat to medium-low and allow to simmer for 4 to 6 hours, periodically checking to make sure the liquid doesn\\'t dissipate, and adding water if needed. When the meat is beginning to become tender, add the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. The stew is finished when the meat is very tender (the flavor should be intense and very tasty). Adjust the seasoning, as needed, and whisk in the butter just before serving to make the sauce a little richer."

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with 1 inch of cold water, add 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the potatoes until they are fork-tender, 5 to 8 minutes (depending on how big they are). Drain the potatoes and set aside until cool enough to handle; thinly slice the potatoes into rounds and set aside.Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the grapeseed oil and cod and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer the fish to a large plate and set aside.Arrange the fennel, garlic, potatoes, oregano, thyme, olives, capers and tomatoes in a medium broiler-proof casserole dish. Place the cod seared-side up and in the center of the dish and cover the cod with some of the vegetables. Drizzle with some olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper.Bake until the cod feels semi-firm to light pressure and the vegetables are caramelized, about 15 minutes. Heat the broiler to high and finish the fish under the broiler for 1 minute, until the crust is extra browned. Serve garnished with the parsley.'

S'Grease a 2-quart baking dish with butter. In a large bowl, mix the vanilla wafers, apricots, raisins, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Slice the bananas and fold into the dry ingredients. Transfer to the baking dish, distributing evenly. In another bowl, mix eggs, milk, vanilla and amaretto, whiskey or warm water.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the milk and egg mixture over the dry ingredients. Let the baking dish stand for about 20 minutes to allow the liquid to absorb.Prepare a bain marie by placing the baking dish into a larger pan or dish, placing the arrangement into the preheated oven, and then pouring hot water into the outer dish (without splashing any into the custard dish). Bake until the pudding firms and puffs up and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and from water bath. Spread apricot jelly over the top of pudding and let rest.Increase oven heat to 425 degrees F.To make the meringue topping, make a slurry with 1/3 cup water gradually whisked into a small saucepan to which you have added cornstarch and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. As it thickens and becomes translucent, cover and remove it from the heat. In a scrupulously clean large metal or glass bowl, with scrupulously clean beaters, beat the egg whites (they must be at room temperature) until foamy. Add vanilla and cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Very gradually beat in sugar on high until glossy and stiff peaks form, but do not allow it to get dry. Reduce the speed of the beater to low and gradually add the cornstarch slurry. When it has all been added increase speed to medium for about 10 seconds.Spread the meringue over the bread pudding, swirling it decoratively with the back of a spoon, and being sure to anchor the meringue to the sides of the baking dish. Bake until the meringue browns, 5 or 10 minutes.'

S'In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the butter to melt. Once the butter has melted, reduce the heat, add the flour and stir to create a roux; the roux should be pale blond in color. Once the roux is made, reduce the heat again to low, add the milk, stirring into the roux and cooking until the roux has thickened. Finally, add the blue cheese, 1 cup at a time, until all the cheese has been added and well blended. Season with the salt and pepper blend. Remove from the heat and continue to stir to ensure consistency.Once the sauce has been prepared, add the orzo, spinach and tomatoes and stir to incorporate into the cream sauce. Allow the orzo to warm with the sauce, then remove from the heat and serve. This has a shelf life of 5 days.'

S"Special equipment: 1-inch circle cutterCut potato slices with a 1 to 1 1/2-inch circle cutter and soak in water to remove starch. Place on a rack placed over a shallow pan of water. Steam to al dente and set aside to cool. Using a melon baller (ball scoop) scoop out a recess in each disk.Cook bacon and remove to paper towels to drain. Pour most of the bacon fat from the pan and add butter over medium heat. Add cabbage and season with black pepper. Cook until it begins to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir in corned beef, and crumble in bacon. Cook together for about 10 minutes to allow flavors to integrate, remove from heat and stir in horseradish.To begin the sauce:Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves, and nutmeg over medium heat. Spoon the melted butter into a separate heat resistant bowl and whisk in the cornstarch, then whisk in 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, reserving the rest. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the cheese mixture, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf and cloves. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Stir enough of the sauce and reserved Parmesan into the corned beef/cabbage mixture to bind into a thick mixture. Spoon the mixture onto prepared potato disks, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and place on a baking sheet. Flash finish in oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes (monitor to make sure they don\\'t burn). Sprinkle with chives and serve."

S'For the pot roast: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Sprinkle the beef chuck liberally with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it smokes. Add the grapeseed oil and allow the oil to heat for a few seconds. Carefully place the chuck in the pan and sear each side until browned (do not move the meat too much; it will release from the pan when it is ready to be moved). Transfer the meat to a roasting pan or ovenproof casserole dish.In the saute pan, add the onions, carrots and celery and cook until the onions and carrots get some color, 8 to 10 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the red wine and allow the wine to simmer until the alcohol has cooked off, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the tomato paste and then the beef broth and allow the cooking liquid to simmer for a few minutes to marry the flavors. Season with salt and pepper and then pour the cooking liquid over the roast in the roasting pan.Cover the roast with a layer of plastic wrap and then a layer of aluminum foil. Cook until tender, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the roast from the oven and allow it to rest in the cooking liquid for 30 to 40 minutes.For the pan jus: After the meat has rested, strain the cooking liquid and pour it back into a pan. Bring to a simmer and simmer until reduced to 4 cups.Whisk together the cornstarch and 6 tablespoons water. Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering cooking liquid and then cook the jus until it thickens to cover the back of a spoon. Season with pepper.For the whipped potatoes: In a pot, cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are fork-tender. Drain the potatoes; set the strainer over the sink and allow the potatoes to steam for 5 minutes.Pour the potatoes back into the pot, add the melted butter and sour cream and whip with a hand blender until smooth. Season with salt and white pepper.Bring a pot of water to a boil; prepare an ice-water bath. Blanch the broccoli in the boiling water and then transfer to the water bath to stop the cooking process. Repeat with the carrots. Drain and set aside.To plate: In a large saute pan, heat the grapeseed oil until it begins to smoke. Add the broccoli and carrots and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Divide the whipped potatoes among 6 plates. Slice the pot roast and place the slices on top of the potatoes. Ladle the pan jus over the pot roast. and then place the broccoli and carrots around the plate.'

Then add the dry mustard, paprika, salt/pepper blend and cayenne. Mix well and store up to 7 days. Best to prepare 1 day in advance and do not puree or pulse the vegetables, they should be hand cut. Yield: 1 1/2 cups.For the catfish: Preheat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. Then toast the buns in a skillet with warmed butter over medium heat until light brown, 1 to 2 minutes.In batches, lightly coat the fish fillets with the flour/spice mixture, tap off excess any flour and then dip the fillets into the egg wash. Finally finish the fillets in the cornmeal. Then drop the breaded fillets in the oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove the fish from the oil and allow any excess oil to drip off.To build the sandwiches, toss the lettuce with the remoulade, and then place on the bottom bun. Add the tomatoes, onions, fish and the top bun. Serve.'

S"To begin red pepper coulis, preheat oven to 450 degrees F. On the stovetop, bring the chicken stock, onion, garlic and wine to a simmer in a saucepan. Place the peppers in a roasting pan and roast in the oven, checking every 15 minutes, and turning them with tongs until the skin is fully wrinkled and charred black. When the peppers are done, use tongs to put them in a resealable bag which (for safety reasons) you have resting on a plate - (remember, they\\'re volcanically hot!). Carefully close the bag shut, and allow them to sweat for 5 minutes. Use oven mitts to prevent getting burned while you handle the bag in the next step of sliding the peppers from the bag into a bowl filled with a couple of inches of ice water. You can then use your fingers to work quickly to slip off and discard the skins of the peppers while they are in the water. You will be left with beautifully cooked red peppers with a wonderful color. Chop the peppers and add them to the simmering chicken stock mixture, and continue simmering until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Create a slurry of cornstarch in a small amount of water and add to the red pepper sauce. Process coulis in a blender until a smooth consistency is achieved. Then season with salt and pepper, to taste.For the grits:Bring the water for the grits to a boil. Add grits and chopped shrimp, reduce heat and cook until grits are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in scallions, tomatoes, cilantro, bacon and cheese, and keep covered in a warm place.For the fish:Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat both sides of red snapper with salt and pepper and Cajun spice. Then on the stovetop, heat some grapeseed oil in a large non-stick saute pan, and when it begins to shimmer, saute the shrimp only until they turn pink, and then remove shrimp to a utility platter. In the same pan, sear each side of the fish. (When you place the fillet into the pan, leave it undisturbed for a couple of minutes to allow the seasoning to cook into the surface of the fish.) Cook until golden brown, then finish in the oven for a further 2 to 3 minutes and remove it to rest for 5 to 8 minutes. (Please take care to avoid overcooking the fish, as it will continue to cook even after you remove it from the oven.)Place some of the grits in the middle of serving plate, then position a fish fillet on top, and drizzle the coulis around the fish. Top with a shrimp. Garnish liberally with the scallions."

S'In a bowl, mix together vinegar, oil, rosemary, garlic, lemon juice and salt and pepper blend. Put the steak in an 8 by 12-inch casserole dish and generously coat with the vinegar mixture. Allow to marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour in the refrigerator.Preheat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan.Remove the steak from the marinade, straining excess marinade from the steak. Removing the excess marinade will prevent flaming, or charring of the steak during cooking. Put the steak on the grill, and cook over high heat, about 8 to 9 minutes per side. Remove the steak from the grill to a cutting board and let rest, about 5 minutes, before cutting. Slice the steak on the bias, top to bottom, against the grain, 1/4-inch thick. Arrange the steak over the potatoes on a serving platter and serve.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.In a large bowl, mix together the oil, 1 teaspoon of parsley, the garlic, onion, and salt and pepper blend. Add the potatoes and toss to coat. Transfer the seasoned potatoes onto a baking sheet and roast until the onions are soft to touch, about 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oven and set aside. In a large bowl combine the truffle oil, cheese, remaining parsley and thyme. Add potatoes and toss to coat evenly. Return the potatoes to the baking sheet and roast for additional 20 minutes.'

(The acids in the marinade will "cook" the scallops.)Peel cucumbers and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices. Strain scallop mixture and spoon onto cucumber disks. Top with 1/8 teaspoon of caviar.'

S'For the crab cakes: In a mixing bowl, mix all the ingredients except the crab until thoroughly mixed. Gently stir in the crab, being careful not to break up lumps. Place in the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the corn relish.For the corn relish: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the corn on all sides. Kernels should be mostly browned and lightly charred.Next, cut the tomatoes and onion into small dice, and then toss them in a bowl with the parsley, garlic, seafood seasoning, and vinegar. Then, cut the kernels from the cobs, being careful not to include any cob or silk. Add to the bowl and stir. Finish with the mayo, stirring well. (Add more mayo to the mix if too loose. Relish should be thick and easy to spoon onto the crab cakes.)Next, portion the crab mixture into bite-sized cakes. Pour the flour onto a plate. Place the cakes in the flour and toss to coat lightly. You do not want a thick layer of flour.Heat a large saute pan over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons butter. When the butter is melted, add the crab cakes and cook until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the cakes to a paper towel to drain. Season with salt.Cook the rest of the cakes in batches, adding more butter as needed. You can wipe out the pan between batches if there are overcooked bits.Top each cake with corn relish and serve.'

S'Rub Cajun spice into the surface of the meat. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit while you prepare the sauce and pasta. (The rub will actually begin to "cure" the meat.)For the sauce, melt butter in a large saucepan which will be large enough to accommodate the pound of cooked pasta, and saute onion until it becomes translucent. Mix in the flour to make a roux. Gradually add chicken broth and allow thickening. Remove from heat and whisk in Parmesan. Immediately cover surface of sauce with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside briefly.Bring a pot of water to boil for the pasta.Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet.  Cook the sun-dried tomatoes for a few minutes, then with a slotted spoon transfer them to the cheese sauce and whisk in. Cover the pot of sauce and set aside. Reserve the skillet and all the bits in it for the meat.Boil the pasta until al dente and drain. Add the cooked pasta to the saute pan containing the sauce and fold to coat pasta. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Keep covered in a warm place while you cook the steaks. Over medium high heat, sear the steaks, about 3 minutes per side and cook to your liking. Slice steaks into bite sized pieces and serve over pasta.'

S'For the catfish: To marinate the catfish, place the fillets and buttermilk in a flat bottomed container. Allow to marinate in the fridge for a minimum 30 minutes, maximum 1 day.Preheat a fryer to 350 degrees F with vegetable oil. Before frying, remove the catfish from the marinade and allow any excess buttermilk to drip off. Season the cornmeal with salt and pepper. Coat a fillet with flour, then egg wash, then seasoned cornmeal and repeat the process with the remaining fillets before frying. Fry until the catfish reaches 145 degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the fryer and allow to drain any excess oil on a plate with paper towels.For the sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and melt. Next, add the onions, peppers and celery and sweat until translucent. Then stir in the flour, seafood seasoning and garlic to thicken the butter. This will take 1 to 2 minutes.Next, add the cream and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until the cream sets. Finally, add the crawfish and whisk to blend, cooking for final 2 minutes.To serve, place 1/2 cup grits or polenta on the plate, then a quarter of the prepared crawfish sauce and top with a crisp cooked fish.

S"For the cranberries: In a saucepan over medium-high heat bring the cranberries, orange juice and zest, allspice, and sugar to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cranberry skins begin to burst, 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until thickened and the liquid has reduced. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.For the turkey: Blend the fresh herbs, salt, and pepper with 1 tablespoon oil and rub over the turkey breast.Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat and add the remaining1 tablespoon oil. Sear the turkey breast until browned, reduce the heat, flip the breast, and add the chicken stock to fill the pan up to 1/4-inch. Cover the pan and cook until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove the turkey from the pan and keep warm.For the gravy: Place the turkey pan over medium heat, stir in the flour, and whisk until well blended. Add the chicken stock, thyme, and sage. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes until thickened. Strain sauce into a clean pan and whisk in the butter. Keep on low heat to keep warm.For the peas: Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Blanch the peas and drain them. Pour out the water from the pan. In the same saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour, salt, and white pepper and whisk together until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cream, reduce the heat to medium-low, and then add the cheese and peas, cooking until thickened and peas are softened, 10 to 12 minutes.For the potatoes: Peel and slice the potato on the bias.Heat the oil in a saute pan over high heat and heat until just about smoking. (It\\'s important to have high heat so you get a good browning!)Add the potato slices to the pan and cook for 3 minutes on one side. Flip the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the chives. Turn off the heat.For plating: Plate the creamed peas in the center of the plate. Slice the turkey breast on the bias and place on top of the peas. Drizzle the cranberry sauce on the side of the peas. Spoon the gravy over turkey breast."

S'For the filling: Heat the oil for 1 minute in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring with a spoon to keep the beef from clumping. Then add the oregano, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste and cook for another 3 minutes. Transfer the filling to a colander and drain the excess oil, then transfer it to a bowl and stir in the ricotta. Refrigerate until ready to use.For the breading: In a food processor, pulse the panko breadcrumbs to half of their original size; this will allow them to bread the ravioli evenly. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl and mix them well with the Parmesan, parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.For the dough: Slowly sift the all-purpose flour, semolina and 1 teaspoon of the salt into a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil and 1 to 2 tablespoons of water. Form the sifted flour into a mound on a counter and pour half the egg mixture into the center of the mound. Start forming a dough with two fingers while supporting the mound of flour with the other hand, then add the remainder of the egg mixture once the original amount is absorbed. Continue kneading the dough by hand until all the liquid has been absorbed, 5 to 6 minutes, dusting the work surface with flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking. Once the dough is mixed well, roll it into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.To assemble and fry: Split the rested dough into 2 balls and roll out each ball on a floured work surface to the thickness of a dime (or run them through a pasta machine three times on thickness settings of 8, 5 and finally 2). Score one of the sheets of rolled dough with a ravioli pin and fill each scored pocket with 1 teaspoon of the filling. Brush the edges of the dough with egg wash, lay the second sheet of rolled pasta on top and then press and seal the individual ravioli with your fingers, ensuring that no air is trapped inside. Cut and portion out the individual pieces.In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees F. Dredge the ravioli in the flour, followed by the egg wash, and finally the breading. Working in batches, fry the ravioli for 3 minutes, flipping them once during the process. Drain on paper towels, then serve with marinara sauce.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Heat a roasting pan over high heat with the oil. Sprinkle the ribs with salt and pepper. Add the ribs to the pan, then reduce the heat to medium. Sear on both the top and bottom of the meat, 2 to 3 minutes per side, reserving the pan drippings. After searing the ribs, add the stock, mirepoix, tomato paste, merlot, garlic and the reserved pan drippings to the pan. Tightly cover and cook in the oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove the pan from the oven and check the ribs, which should be fork tender. If need be, continue cooking to achieve desired tenderness. Next remove the ribs and reserve the liquid to create sauce.Pour the reserved cooking liquid through a strainer, then discard the remaining vegetables. In a saucepan, blend the herbs and liquid over medium-high heat. Reduce the liquid by three-quarters, yielding 3 cups of sauce. Pass the reduced sauce through a strainer, then set aside and keep warm.For the potatoes: In a large pot, bring 1 gallon of water to a boil. Add the potatoes and cook until softened, 15 to 18 minutes, then drain. Pass the potatoes and butter through a food mill or ricer into a bowl. Next add the salt and pepper, and then blend with a whisk. Taste and add additional salt and pepper if needed.To serve, place the mashed potatoes in the center of the plate, top with a short rib, and finish with the warm sauce. Repeat for the remaining short ribs.'

S'To make the "white" mirepoix, mix the onion, lemon grass, celery, and leek and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. (In combination with the fish and egg whites, the mirepoix will form the clarification to make the consomme crystal clear. This combination of ingredients will form what is referred to as a raft that essentially coagulates as the consomme clarifies.) Mix the chilled mirepoix, ginger root, fish scraps, shrimp shells, and egg white and add to a stockpot. Pour in the chilled fish stock. Add the lemon juice. Bring to a simmer (just below a boil in classical cooking) over low heat, stirring frequently so that the clarification ingredients remain free floating. Please note that the heat must be kept at a simmer, low enough so that the raft which is forming does not break apart from the action of cooking and high enough to cook out the impurities so that they can be collected in the raft. Once the raft forms and rises to the surface, cease stirring. However, gather some broth from the edge of the pot and baste the raft to keep it from breaking apart. After 60 to 90 minutes at the correct simmer, the raft will begin to sink, at which point the consomme is finished.For the edamame, add soybeans in their pods to a pot and cover with water. Boil until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove soybeans from their pods and set aside until needed.In a food processor blend shrimp, egg whites, scallions, salt and pepper to a paste. Spoon some of this mixture into a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe tiny dumplings into the consomme and poach.Spoon 1/4 cup edamame into bowls, and ladle soup over.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To sear the salmon, sprinkle the fillets with the salt and pepper. Heat a pan over high heat with the oil until the pan is smoking hot. Place the salmon into the heated pan, reduce the heat and allow to sear on the first side for 2 to 3 minutes. Then flip and sear the second side, about 2 minutes. Then remove from the pan and allow to cool.To create the mousse topping, first whip the whites until stiff. Next, in a food processor, puree the shrimp, and then add the parsley and seafood seasoning and pulse 7 to 8 times. Next, remove the shrimp and place in a bowl. Add the whipped whites and mix in a folding fashion. After creating the topping, evenly portion about 2 tablespoons of the mousse on top of the cooked salmon fillets.To finish the salmon, evenly spread the seasoned breadcrumbs on top of the mousse. Finish in the oven, cooking for 10 minutes. Then remove and serve.'

In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, salt, brown sugar, cumin, pepper, coriander and cayenne.Sprinkle the salmon fillet with a generously with the spice mix and rest the fish for 1 hour.Roast the salmon in the oven until fully cooked, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the salmon from the oven and cool slightly. Flake the salmon into medium chunks and season with salt and pepper.For the slaw: In a bowl, combine the vinegar, oil, soy sauce, sugar and lime juice, and whisk until the sugar dissolves.Add the cabbage, carrots and scallions, and mix well to coat all of the slaw with the dressing. Refrigerate the slaw for at least 1 hour before using.For plating: Heat a cast-iron griddle over high heat until the griddle begins to smoke. Warm the tortillas on the griddle without any oil, just until they are pliable.Heat the oil on the griddle and add the flaked salmon to bring back up to temperature if the salmon has cooled. (If the salmon is hot out of the oven skip this step.)Place about 3 ounces of flaked salmon in the center of each tortilla and top with 2 ounces of slaw. Plate 2 tacos with a lime wedge for each serving.'

S'Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. ("Proofing" the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn\\\'t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes. Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour in the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass.Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to 1 hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and divide into 6 equally sized balls. Cover with towel and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time.While the dough is rising, prepare the "base" pizza topping. Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat and saute shallots and thyme until the onion begins to turn translucent. (If you are using dried mushrooms, remove them from their soaking liquid, lifting them out so all grit remains at the bottom.) Add the porcini to the pan, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook until tender. Remove from heat, stir in heavy cream, and scoop into a food processor. Pulse to chop and set aside to rest. This is your base toppingPreheat oven to 450 degrees F. On a floured surface, stretch the dough into 6 (6 by 8-inch) ovals and shake cornmeal over both sides of the dough. (The crust will be par-baked on both sides on the stovetop before you add the topping to be baked.) In a heavy bottomed 12-inch skillet which has a lid, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat. (Swirl the oil to coat the entire inside of the skillet.) Transfer each dough oval to the skillet, allowing 1 side to lightly cook and stiffen up before flipping it over with tongs. When both sides of each oval are par-baked this way, transfer to a pizza stone. Spoon the base topping into the center of the now toasted crusts, spreading evenly over the surface.For the finishing topping, heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large saute pan and cook the porcini, cremini, shiitake, garlic and thyme until tender. Spread evenly over the base topping and lay fresh mozzarella slices over.Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes until cheese melts and edges of crust are golden.'

Then using a slotted spoon to leave excess liquid behind, transfer meat mixture to the center of each tortilla and fold the tortilla into a closed packet and secure using a wooden skewer or round toothpicks. Deep fry chimichangas until golden brown. (Alternatively, you can skip the deep frying step altogether by arranging the chimichanga packets on a baking sheet and bake until cheese melts and tortillas begin to firm up, about 5 to 10 minutes in a preheated 350 degrees F oven.)

Cook until done, about 6 to 8 more minutes, then remove to a utility platter. To the same pan add the shrimp and cook until just pink and remove to a bowl. To the same pan add the scallops and cook until opaque and remove to the bowl with the shrimp. Add the mussels to the pan along with 1/2 cup water. Cook until the mussels open. Remove them and the pan juices to a bowl until they are cool enough to handle. (Discard any mussels that do not open.)In the same saucepan, heat the other 2 tablespoons of olive oil and butter. Add the celery and onions, sauteing until translucent. Whisk in the flour gradually to make a roux. Add clam juice and fish stock and mix well to integrate flavors. Reduce heat to low and bring to a simmer. Add carrots and parsley and let cook until fork tender.While the soup is cooking, cut the halibut fillets into 1/2 inch chunks. Then, remove the mussels from their shells and discard shells, but reserving all the liquids in the bowl.When carrots are softened, remove soup from heat and gently fold in halibut, shrimp, scallops, mussels and liquid in the bowl.

S'For the bread pudding: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a baking dish with butter. Add the cubed bread.In a small saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons butter.In a large bowl, combine the melted butter, raisins, condensed milk, sugar, and vanilla and whisk together. Add the eggs and whisk again until thoroughly combined.Pour the custard over the bread and allow to soak for a few minutes. Press the bread into the liquid to help absorb.Sprinkle the top with the cinnamon and chopped pecans and bake in the oven until the custard is set, about 30 minutes. Stick a paring knife into the center of the pudding. If it comes out with liquid stuck to the knife, cook for a few minutes more until firm. Remove the bread pudding from the oven and allow to cool a bit.For the peach sauce: In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the peaches, sugar, and liqueur and stir gently until the sugar dissolves. Allow to simmer until the mixture begins to thicken and darken, about 2 minutes. Stir while cooking to avoid burning. Add the heavy cream and stir to combine. Allow to heat through and thicken, about 2 minutes. If the sauce needs additional thickening, combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and stir some into the sauce. Remove from the heat and keep warm.For the rum sauce: Heat a small, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the sugar. Stir and cook until the sugar is melted. Remove from the heat and add the orange liqueur and dark rum. Return to the heat and simmer for 1 minute, and then flambe, if desired, or just let the alcohol burn off.To plate: Using a ring cutter, cut out rounds of bread pudding and plate in a shallow bowl. Pour the peach sauce over top, and then the rum sauce. Garnish with a dollop of creme fraiche and a small sprig fresh mint.'

Transfer the toasted spices to a molcajete or mortar and pestle and grind together.Sprinkle the pork cubes with the spices, covering all surfaces of the meat as much as possible. Let the pork sit covered in the refrigerator for 2 hours.Create a beurre manie by mashing the flour into the butter in a small bowl. Set aside until needed as a thickener for the stew.Heat the grapeseed oil in a deep saute pan over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the pork cubes and brown on all sides. Lower heat to medium and add the garlic and onion and stir to combine flavors. Cook until the onion turns translucent, then stir in chili powder and paprika. Add 4 cups water and reduce heat to low. Cover and let simmer until fork tender, about 2 hours. Add water as needed throughout the cooking process. In the last 30 minutes of cooking time, add the beurre manie to thicken. Serve hot.'

Pour most of the fat out of the pan and add the cream to the same pan over low heat, allowing to reduce by about one-third.While the cream is reducing, finely chop the now cooled spinach, and return it briefly to the colander placed over a bowl. Cut the bacon strips into 1/4-inch pieces.Whisk the Parmesan into the reduced cream, and season with pepper. Since the cheese will add saltiness, add salt only if needed.

Remove the chicken to a medium bowl and add enough cornstarch to coat the chicken; it should form a sticky-like paste around the chicken. Cover the bowl and let rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.For the sauce:Combine all the sauce ingredients, except the cornstarch slurry, in a large saucepan over medium heat and simmer until the sugar dissolves.Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pan to 350 to 360 degrees F. Carefully test the oil by dropping a single piece of chicken into it and cook for around 4 minutes. When the oil is hot enough, slowly add a few pieces of chicken at a time, until all the chicken is cooked. Remove the chicken from the oil to paper towels to drain.Add a little more oil to a clean wok or skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot add the chiles and green onions to saute for around 1 minute. Add the already cooked chicken to the wok and toss around with the chiles so that all the chicken gets great flavor. At this point add the warmed sauce mixture, a few spoonfuls at a time, until all the chicken is coated but not soaking wet.If the sauce is a little runny add the cornstarch slurry, a little at a time, to thicken the sauce. Remember you have to cook the sauce until bubbling after you have added the cornstarch. This normally takes a couple of minutes over low heat. Remove the chicken mixture from the wok to a serving bowl and serve immediately on fried or steamed rice. Garnish with whole cilantro leaves before serving.'

S'In a medium pot, heat the chicken broth to a simmer. In a separate large saute pan heat half the oil (1/4 cup). Add the diced onion, garlic, and corn kernels. Use a wooden spoon to saute together until the onions appear translucent, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, toss the diced potatoes with the remaining (1/4 cup) oil and season them with salt and pepper. Add the potatoes to the saute pan with the onion, garlic and corn. Stir with a wooden spoon and allow surface of potatoes to toast lightly. Gradually add the heated chicken broth to the saute pan just enough to cover the potatoes and corn mixture. Over a medium to medium high heat, the potatoes will cook in the broth and by the end of cooking time; most of the liquid should evaporate. If the broth has boiled away before the potatoes are cooked, add more broth in an amount that is just enough to cover. Be careful to neither burn the potatoes nor allow them to turn too soft. When the potatoes are done, a fork can easily go through, remove from the heat, stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper, as needed. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Trim the salmon by removing a 1 1/2-inch strip from the belly side. Divide into 5 ounce portions, leaving the skin on. Season with salt and pepper. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large oven safe skillet over high heat. Sear fillets beginning with flesh side down first. Do not disturb the fillets for the first 2 to 3 minutes; do not even shake the pan. You will see the surface of the salmon beginning to caramelize. Flip the fillets so that the skin side is now down, and sear until skin is lightly crisped. Transfer fish to a baking dish in the oven to finish. Fish is done when flesh springs back when touched, internal temperature of 140 degrees F. Do not overcook, as fish will continue to cook for a few minutes even after it is removed from oven, known as carryover cooking. (Remember to use oven mitts for the handle when removing that pan from the oven.) Spoon potato/corn "risotto" in center of serving plate. Top with the salmon, and garnish with chives.'

S"For the marinade: Add 1 at a time through the feed opening of a running blender, the mango, tender parts of lemongrass, cilantro, scallions, shallot, and ginger root until they begin to form a paste. Leave the blender running and through the feed opening add the curry paste and sriracha chili sauce and blend together for a few seconds, then continue by adding the liquids 1 at a time: Chardonnay, soy sauce, orange juice, and coconut milk. Reserve half of this mixture in a small bowl to make into a sauce.Arrange the salmon in a shallow bowl and pour the other half of the mixture over the fish. Cover and let marinate refrigerated for at least 2 hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Transfer the reserved sauce mixture to a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until it begins to bubble and thicken.Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe skillet and sear each side of the salmon (skin side down first) without disturbing for the first 3 to 4 minutes of sear time on each side. (This allows the surface to caramelize, so the fish won\\'t tear apart when you flip it.) Transfer the pan to the oven to finish the fish - a further 5 to 7 minutes, depending upon the thickness of the fillets. Do not overcook the fish. It is done when it springs back upon being lightly prodded. Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven (that handle will be hot). Transfer salmon to a platter and let rest.Strain the sauce and spoon over the salmon fillets."

S'Place the lime in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since this lime will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set this aside briefly, until it cools just enough to handle. Blend the allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, thyme, onions, scallions, pepper - together in a blender or food processor to make a pulp. Return to the lime and squeeze the juice into the blender through the feed tube. Reserve lime skins. Add the soy sauce through the feed tube and mix well.Season chicken pieces with jerk seasoning and place them along with the lime skins in a container which you will be able to cover tightly. Pour the marinade over the chicken and rest in the refrigerator overnight (or a minimum of 4 hours). Keep tightly covered and away from other foods, as it will taint them.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Transfer the marinated chicken to a roasting pan and pour oil over the chicken. Roast covered for about 25 minutes, removing the cover and increasing the temperature to 400 degrees F for the last 5 to 10 minutes or so. When the chicken is done, the flesh will feel firm and the juices will run clear. You can also use an instant-read thermometer which should register an internal temperature of 170 degrees F.The chicken can also be cooked on the grill. Heat grill to medium-high heat. Wrap chicken in a foil pouch in which you have shaken 1 tablespoon flour, and cook over indirect heat (on the side of the grill opposite the direct heat source) for about 15 to 20 minutes.While the chicken is cooking, prepare the aioli. Add peaches, mayonnaise, and cilantro to a food processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt and white pepper, to taste.Assemble sandwiches by placing sauce on roll, then chicken and top with shredded Cheddar and a sprig of cilantro.'

S'Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a skillet and saute the onion until it begins to caramelize. Add the broccoli and saute until tender. Remove from heat and set aside.In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat and add the garlic, onion, and bay leaf. In another small saucepot, heat the milk. Saute the onion until it becomes translucent, then deglaze pan with the white wine, and cook for a few minutes to let most of the wine evaporate, then turn the heat to medium-low. Whisk the Parmesan into the hot milk, then gradually whisk into the onion mixture. In a small bowl, create a slurry by whisking a small amount of water into the cornstarch. Add this to the sauce to thicken it. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming, and keep in a warm place.Season the salmon with salt and pepper and slice lengthwise into 3/4-inch wide strips. Roll the strips into a spiral, secure with a skewer, and place on a baking sheet. Set aside briefly.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.In a food processor blend shrimp, egg whites, salt and pepper to a paste. Spread some of this mixture evenly onto each of the salmon spirals, then spray with spray butter. Place in the oven, and bake until the fish flakes and the shrimp crusts a golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest.While the salmon/shrimp spirals are in the oven, prepare the plates. Toss the onion, broccoli mixture with enough of the sauce to coat. Spoon some of this mixture into the center of each serving plate. Top with a salmon/shrimp spiral, then drizzle with sauce and garnish with dill.'

S'Whisk the cornstarch into the vegetable broth. Melt the butter over medium heat in a saute pan, and then add the chicken broth mixture, red peppers and garlic. Simmer 30 minutes. *Pour hot mixture into blender and blend until smooth to make red pepper sauce. While the pepper sauce is simmering, begin the polenta.For the Polenta:Combine vegetable stock and cream in a large heavy saucepan. Heat to a gentle boil over medium heat, being careful not to burn. While whisking constantly, gradually add the cornmeal. Once cornmeal is incorporated, keep heat low and continue to whisk until mixture is slightly thickened and creamy. Stir in Parmesan, and season with pepper. (Since Parmesan is salty, add salt only if needed). Set aside in a warm place.For the Ragout:Heat oil in a saute pan. Saute onion, garlic, carrot, zucchini, yellow squash, and eggplant, until they begin to soften. Stir in tomato paste, chopped fresh parsley, thyme, and let cook until flavors integrate, about 10 more minutes. Add olives and heat through. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Remove from heat and stir in fresh tomato. Let sit to rest.To plate:place cheese polenta onto serving plate, making a well in the center. Top with vegetable ragout in the center, and spoon red pepper coulis over top. Garnish with fresh basil.*When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.'

Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, skimming any impurities from the surfaceWhile tripe is cooking cover the chiles with water in a separate small saucepot and boil until re-hydrated and soft. Cool and strain, reserving the cooking liquid. Heat one tablespoon of the grapeseed oil over medium heat in a skillet (reserving the rest of the oil). When the oil begins to shimmer, saute onion and garlic until the onions become translucent. Remove from heat and transfer onions and garlic to a small bowl and reserve the skillet. Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles and add to the bowl with the onions. Using the cooking liquid as needed (reserving the rest of the cooking liquid), mash into a paste with the onions and garlic. Using the same skillet heat the reserved tablespoon of grapeseed oil over medium-high heat and fry the paste for a few minutes. Remove from heat and set aside until needed.Prepare the hominy as directed on the package, utilizing the remaining chile cooking liquid as part of the cooking liquid for the hominy. (Usually you will need 4 times as much water as hominy). Mix the chile paste well with the cooked hominy. Stir into the pot of tripe, season with chili powder and return to a simmer and allow to thicken. Ladle into bowls and place small amount of sliced radishes in the center. Squeeze fresh lime juice over.'

S'Heat the canola oil over medium heat in a large saute pan. Season the pheasant with salt and pepper and coat with the softened butter. Brown all sides of the pheasant until golden brown and remove to a utility platter. To the same pan, add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion becomes translucent. Deglaze the pan with the Marsala wine and add bay leaves and parsley. Lower the heat and return the pheasant to the pan. (Wash and dry the utility platter and keep handy for the cooked pheasant.) Cover and simmer until the pheasant is tender and juices in the thigh run clear when pierced, about 35 minutes. Remove the pheasant to the utility platter and allow to rest until cool enough to handle.Strain the braising juices into another pot and skin off any excess fat. Add balsamic vinegar and brown sauce and cook over medium heat until thickened.Pull pheasant meat from the bones and cut into 1-inch pieces, discarding bones. Remove sauce from heat. In a bowl fold pheasant meat with enough sauce to coat. Do not feel obligated to use all of the sauce. The mixture should not be soupy. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the pastry dough and, using an appropriately sized cereal bowl or small mixing bowl as a template, cut 4 rounds 8-inches in diameter.Spoon the pheasant mixture evenly into 4 individual ovenproof 6-inch bowls (onion soup bowls are ideal for this), and brush the edges of the bowls with egg. Top each with a circle of pastry, draping the crust over the rim. Brush the tops of the pastry with the egg wash and bake until golden, about 12 to 15 minutes.From Food Network Kitchen: This recipe has been updated and may differ from what was originally published or broadcast.'

S'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease an oven-to-table baking dish with some of the butter. Melt the rest of the butter in a saucepan or small skillet and saute the onion until it becomes translucent. Gradually add the flour to make blond roux, then slowly add the milk and allow the mixture to thicken. Season with white pepper and just a dash of salt and remove from heat. (Be careful to avoid overdoing the salt, because there is salt in the cheese.) Layer 1/3 of the potatoes in the baking dish, followed by 1/3 of the milk sauce, and 1/4 cup of the shredded white Cheddar. Repeat the sequence twice for a total of 3 layers. You can top with the breadcrumbs before baking, but omit if making the dish gluten-free. Bake covered for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, removing the cover for the last 10 minutes. (You can speed up the cooking time by pre-microwaving for 10 to 15 minutes before baking, or even par-boiling the potatoes.) The scalloped potatoes are done when the potatoes are tender. Let rest a few minutes before serving. Garnish with sliced scallions and bread crumbs. All kids seem to love this dish (adults too). I keep this dish visually simple using only light colored ingredients, because kids seem to prefer it without green things (like the green parts of scallions), or black stuff (like ground pepper). However, you can jazz up the color if you like. In the episode, we topped this with bread crumbs - which you can do - but I keep the basic recipe gluten free.'

S"For the breading: In a small bowl, blend the panko and coconut and hold at room temperature until breading.For the sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the mangos with 1/4 cup cold water and the sugar until the mangos have started to break down, stirring throughout. This should take 10 to 12 minutes. Next, add the Sriracha and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and puree in a food processor or blender. Then add the horseradish. Serve or hold.Cook\\'s Note: When blending hot liquids, remove the liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer the liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.For the batter: In a medium mixing bowl, blend the lager, flour, baking powder, Cajun spice and egg yolk with a whisk; the batter should be thick like pancake batter consistency. If additional flour or liquid is needed, add and whisk again and hold cold until breading.For the shrimp: Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 325 degrees F. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Lightly coat the shrimp, excluding the tails, with the seasoned flour, then dip in the beer batter. Evenly coat with the coconut breading, and repeat the process until all the shrimp have been dressed.Carefully place the shrimp in the fryer and cook until golden brown. Repeat the process until all the shrimp have been cooked. Serve with the mango sauce."

S"For the salsa verde: First, dice the tomatoes, medium cut, then puree them in a food processor or blender. Next, add the cilantro, onions, balsamic, garlic, oil and jalapenos. Again, puree, taste, then season with salt and pepper. After seasoning, place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to merge.For the dirty rice: In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the oil  and allow to warm. Next, add the onions and cook, with stirring motion, until slightly translucent. This should take 3 to 4 minutes. Next, add the cooked beans and carrots and allow to warm. Then add the tomato juice and reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue to cook until the juice has reduced to 1/4 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Next, add the rice. Warm the rice and blend the flavors over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Once the rice has warmed and the juice has finished reducing, remove from the heat, add the celery leaves, taste and season to preference with the Cajun spice.For the steak: In a large saute pan over high heat, add and warm the oil for 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the steaks on both sides with the salt and pepper, and add to the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the steak and repeat the process on the second side for a final 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the pan, allow to rest and serve over the dirty rice. Finish with salsa verde.Cook\\'s Note: This steak should be medium-rare to medium based on a 3/4-inch, 8 ounce steak. For additional doneness, finish in a preheated 400 degree F oven to desired temperature."

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S"Special equipment: an immersion blenderFor the tomato sauce: Combine the whole tomatoes and liquid from the can, onion, 2 cloves of the garlic, basil, oregano, olive oil, salt and black pepper in a 2-gallon container and puree with an immersion blender until smooth.Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke. Reduce the heat to medium and add the grapeseed oil and remaining 2 cloves of garlic and quickly saute. Add the diced tomatoes and saute until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the pureed tomato sauce and bring to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes and remove from the heat.For the stuffed peppers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring 1 gallon water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil in a 2-gallon pot. Add the pasta and stir continually for the first 2 minutes of cooking to make sure it doesn\\'t stick, then stir occasionally until the pasta is cooked to al dente, about 9 minutes.Strain the pasta, spread it on a cookie sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Mix to coat and refrigerate until cold.Heat a saute pan over medium heat and add the grapeseed oil and sausage. Cook the sausage, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up the chunks, until browned and fully cooked, about 15 minutes. Remove from the pan, spread on a cookie sheet and refrigerate until cold.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the orzo and sausage in a mixing bowl with the diced tomatoes, Parmesan and basil. Season with salt and black pepper.Cut the top off each bell pepper and remove the seeds and ribs from the inside. Trim the bottom of each pepper so it will sit upright on the plate.Stuff the peppers with the sausage mixture and top with the mozzarella. Arrange in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil, return the peppers to the oven and bake until tender, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow the peppers to sit for 5 minutes.For the broccoli rabe: Combine 2 gallons of water and 4 tablespoons salt in a large pot and bring to a boil. Prepare an ice bath for shocking the broccoli rabe.Add half of the broccoli rabe to the water and cook until al dente, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the broccoli rabe from the water and shock in the ice bath. Bring the water to back up to a boil and repeat with the rest of the broccoli rabe.Remove the broccoli rabe from the ice bath and pat dry with a towel.For plating: Reheat the tomato sauce to a simmer over medium heat.Heat a saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke. Add the grapeseed oil and then add the blanched broccoli rabe. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes and then season with the black pepper and 2 teaspoons of the salt.Pool about 4 ounces of the tomato sauce on 6 plates. Divide the broccoli rabe among the plates, putting it in the center of the plate and making the pile flat so you can place the stuffed pepper on top. Place the stuffed pepper on top of the broccoli rabe and serve immediately."

Begin roasting yams in preheated oven until soft, and remove to let cool enough to handle.Heat olive oil in another large saute pan for the lamb. Season the rack of lamb with salt and pepper. Place lamb into hot pan and sear meat all around.Remove bacon to drain on paper toweling. In same pan lightly saute onion and garlic in bacon fat until translucent. Add red wine and reduce by half.Place the lamb in a roasting pan and roast in the oven until done to your liking, about 15 to 20 minutes for medium rare, an internal temperature of 125 degrees F (this means that because of the 5 to 8 minutes of carryover cooking while it rests, you pull it out at 120 degrees F so it will end up at 125 degrees F for medium rare).When yams are cool enough to handle, peel off skin and add butter and cream and mash. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Remove the lamb to a utility platter and let rest before slicing.Add demi-glace and tomato paste to the pan with the onion, garlic, and bacon fat, then incorporate all beans with mixture. Lower heat and simmer. Add rosemary and chives. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Place sweet potatoes in the middle of a serving platter. Surround potatoes with bean ragout.

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.For the lobster: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Remove the lobster tails from the shells and put into the boiling water. Poach for 2 minutes. Remove the lobster and set aside to cool.Once cooled, chop the lobster and mix with the lime juice, cayenne, seafood seasoning, and mascarpone. Taste and add salt, if needed.For the chowder: On a sheet pan, toss the corn kernels with a few tablespoons oil, season with salt, and roast until the corn is lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.In a deep pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over low heat and add the bacon. Cook until the bacon is crisp. Remove the bacon to a paper towel and pour most of the bacon fat out of the pan.Return the bacon to the pan, add the onion and celery, and cook over medium heat until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the red and green pepper, garlic, and roasted corn, and cook 5 more minutes.Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the chicken stock and stir to scrape up any brown bits from bottom of the pan. Stir in the diced potatoes and raise the heat a little to bring the mixture to a simmer.Simmer the chowder until the potatoes are cooked, about 20 minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid burning the bottom of the chowder.Taste the potatoes. When the potatoes are fork tender, turn the heat down to low and slowly stir in the cream. Keep warm on low heat.To plate: Ladle the chowder into bowls and top each with a mound of lobster. Garnish with sliced scallions.'

S'Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. ("Proofing" the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop a foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn\\\'t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes. Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour in the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and divide into 6 equally sized balls. Cover with towel and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time.While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza topping. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium- high heat in a large saute pan and saute garlic and onions until the onion begins to turn translucent. Season halibut fillets with salt and pepper and sear each side, leaving each side undisturbed for the first minute to allow the flavors to integrate into the surface of the fish. Cook further until the fish flakes, approximately another 6 to 8 minutes, and let rest. Flake the fish and fold into the mashed potatoes. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. On a floured surface, stretch the dough into six 6-inch by 8 inch ovals and shake cornmeal over both sides of the dough. (The crust will be par-"baked" on both sides on the stovetop before you add the topping to be baked.) In a heavy bottomed 12 inch skillet which has a lid, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat. (Swirl the oil to coat the entire inside of the skillet.) Transfer teach dough oval to the skillet, allowing one side to lightly cook and stiffen up before flipping it over with tongs. When both sides of each oval are par-baked this way, transfer to a pizza stone. Spoon the potato/fish mixture in the center of the now toasted crust, spreading evenly over the surface. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes until the tips of the mashed potatoes begin to turn golden. Remove from oven and sprinkle with salmon, curry powder, red onions, and chives.'

Remove the eggplant from the buttermilk, and then coat with flour and tap off the excess. Dip the eggplant in the egg wash and finish with the breadcrumb-Parmesan mixture, coating well. Repeat the process with each eggplant, and then fry in the preheated oil. Allow the eggplant to brown, and then flip the cooked eggplant to ensure even cooking. Once browned, remove the eggplant and place on paper towels to allow the excess oil to drip off.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Warm the cooked pasta in a simmering water bath. Remove and allow the water to drain, and then toss with 3/4 cup of the red sauce. After tossing the pasta with the sauce, portion the pasta and reserve. Place the cooked eggplant on a baking sheet and finish with the remaining sauce. Add some Parmesan cheese and bake, 4 to 5 minutes. After baking, place the eggplant over the sauced pasta and serve.'

S'For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, and saute the shallot until it becomes translucent. Add the mushrooms and cook until they are tender and give up their juices. (While the mushrooms are cooling, begin sauteing the bacon in a separate skillet for the potatoes.) Add the merlot and cook for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate small bowl, make a slurry with 1 tablespoon water and the cornstarch, then add the tomato paste and Dijon mustard and mix thoroughly until smooth. Add this mixture to the pan of mushrooms along with demi-glace and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Turn heat down to medium-low, and allow to reduce and thicken.   White the mushrooms are cooking, heat the oil in the deep-fryer to 375 degrees F or according the manufacturer\\\'s instructions for potatoes. Saute the bacon strips in a skillet until crispy. Remove to paper towels to drain and cool to room temperature. Drain excess bacon fat from the skillet leaving a coating in which to saute the onion. Cook until the onion becomes translucent. Deep-fry the baby potato slices until golden and drain on paper towels. Transfer them to the pan of onions, and crumble in the bacon. Toss in the scallions and season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm.Heat the oven to 375 degrees F for the steak, if you are finishing in the oven. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet with oven-safe handles. Season the steaks with salt and pepper and sear for about 2 minutes per side undisturbed (to let seasonings integrate into the surface of the meat) and then to your preferred level of doneness. Transfer the entire skillet to the oven to finish (about 10 minutes for medium- rare) They can also be cooked on a grill. Let steaks rest, then slice into 1/4-inch thick slices. To serve spoon some potatoes, top with a "fan" of steak slices and drizzle sauce over sliced steak. Garnish the plate with haricots verts.'

S'For the omelet: In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until well-whipped. Add the chives, thyme, salt and pepper, whisking together. Next, in a nonstick omelet pan over medium-high heat, add the oil and allow the pan to heat until hot. Turn the heat off, add the spinach and toss: This step should be done quickly, being careful not overcook or wilt the spinach. Next, place the same pan over high heat, allow the pan to get hot, reduce the heat to medium, and add the whisked eggs. Once the eggs have been added, continue to cook over medium heat, folding the exterior towards the middle of the pan. This folding and blending will ensure that the eggs cook evenly and do not brown. Once the eggs are almost fully cooked, after 2 to 3 minutes, add the spinach and cheese to the center of the eggs. Then fold one side over the spinach with a spatula and repeat with the other side. Finally, flip the filled omelet over and plate.For the vinaigrette: In a large bowl, whisk together the chile paste, vinegar, salt, and honey until well mixed, 1 minute. Next, slowly pour in the grapeseed oil, whisking constantly to emulsify. Be sure not add the oil too quickly as this will cause the dressing to break. Taste for seasoning.To assemble: Toss the fruit with the vinaigrette. Use a slotted spoon to portion the fruit to the plate with omelet and garnish with the sliced mint.'

S'Cover the veal with cold water to "blanch" it. Drain and rinse the veal. Boil about 2 cups of water in a saucepan and then add the pearl onions briefly to scald them. Drain and slip skins from the pearl onions and set them aside.In a large saucepot, combine the veal with the stock and simmer covered over medium-low heat until the veal is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. After the veal has been simmering about 30 minutes, add the sachet d\\\'epices. Then uncover the pot to allow the stock to reduce to intensify the flavor.Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a small pot and gradually add the flour to make a white roux. (Do not allow the roux to brown.) Remove and discard the sachet from the stew. Add the roux to the stew pot and simmer until thickened.In another pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and gently cook the pearl onions and mushrooms until they are tender. To this pan, add the lemon juice and salt and pepper, to taste, and set aside.The heat under the blanquette (stew) must be such that the stew is just below a boil. In a small pot whisk together the egg yolks and cream (known as a liaison) and temper by heating gently and gradually. (You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook.) Add the liaison to the blanquette. Add the reserved pearl onions and mushrooms. Adjust salt and pepper, to taste, if needed.'

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two cookie sheets.Sift together the flour and baking soda in a medium bowl and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, using a hand-held mixer, cream together the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar. Beat in the instant pudding mix until incorporated.Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then add the flour mixture, chocolate chips and vanilla. Using a 1/4-cup-size scoop, drop onto the prepared cookie sheets, leaving a little space between the cookies. Flatten each cookie ball about halfway. Bake until the cookies are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining dough.When cool, put 1 scoop (about 1/4 cup) of vanilla ice cream on a cookie and top with another cookie and press to form a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ice cream. If not serving right away, place in the freezer on a tray. Dust with confectioners\\' sugar and serve.From Food Network Kitchens; after further testing and to ensure the best results this recipe has been altered from what was in the actual episode."

S'To roast vegetables, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place tomatoes and rapini on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper and coat with 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Roast the vegetables until tender, then remove and allow to cool.Begin the Marsala sauce by heating 1/4 cup of the oil in a saute pan and cooking the shallots or onion gently until translucent. Deglaze the pan with the wine and add the stock and fresh thyme. Allow to reduce by 2/3.For the stuffed chicken, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay a long piece of plastic wrap over your cutting board and tuck it underneath the sides of the board. The chicken breasts should be placed on the covered cutting board, skin side down, with enough space between them so they can lay flat after you "butterfly" them. To make the butterfly cut, carefully slice open (without slicing the chicken all the way through) and spread the flesh of the chicken out so you will be able to pound it out into a single thin piece on which you will place stuffing and then roll up. Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Then put another length of plastic wrap over the seasoned chicken breasts and flatten with meat mallet to integrate the seasoning into the chicken. (Covering the chicken with the plastic will also keep the mess down when you pound with the meat mallet.) Pound chicken thin and remove plastic. Lay sliced smoked mozzarella on each breast followed by broccoli rabe and roasted tomatoes. Fold in each end and roll tightly, securing with toothpicks as needed, and placing on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and brush with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place in the oven and roast until fork tender about 45 to 50 minutes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet, season with salt and pepper, and coat with olive oil. Place in the oven and roast potatoes until they are also fork tender.Strain Marsala sauce and whisk in butter to finish. Season with salt and pepper, as needed.Remove any toothpicks securing the chicken. Slice each chicken roll to reveal the stuffed interior. Place on serving plate with roasted potatoes. Spoon Marsala sauce around chicken.  Garnish with chopped chives.'

S'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Season beef liberally with salt and pepper. In large Dutch oven or heavy ovenproof pot over moderately high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add beef and sear until dark brown and crisp on both sides, about 10 minutes total. Transfer beef to large plate. Pour off oil in pan and discard. Add sherry and simmer uncovered, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pan, until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Pour reduced sherry into a heatproof liquid measuring cup.In same pan, combine carrots, onions, celery, garlic, and bay leaf. Lay beef on top of the vegetable mixture and pour in the reduced sherry. Add enough chicken stock to cover 3/4 of meat. Cover and place on lowest rack in the oven. Roast until fork-tender, about 3 hours.While beef is roasting, prepare roasted carrots and caramelized onions. During final hour of roasting, in large bowl, toss carrots with olive oil until well coated. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spread on baking sheet and transfer to upper rack in oven. Roast until slightly tender and browned, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer to large bowl and keep warm.   During final 30 minutes of roasting, place a heavy 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat, add the canola oil and heat until hot but not smoking. Add onions and saute, stirring constantly, until caramelized, about 20 to 25 minutes. Season, to taste, with kosher salt, add to roasted carrots in large bowl, and keep warm.When beef is tender, transfer to serving platter and tent with foil. Skim fat from liquid in pot. Strain liquid through fine-mesh sieve, pressing on solids with back of spoon to extract all juices, then discard the solids. Return liquid to pot, set over high heat, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to moderate and simmer, uncovered, until reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Season juices to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour half of juices into bowl with carrots and onions; toss to combine. Pour the other half of the juices into gravy dish. Arrange carrots and onions around beef on a serving platter and serve immediately, with extra juices on side.'

S"Pour the milk and heavy cream into a heavy bottomed saucepot and scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pot (or add vanilla extract). *Cook\\'s Note: If using a vanilla bean, put the vanilla pod in the pot as well. Add half the sugar and bring to a simmer. In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar. Temper it by adding a small amount of the heated milk mixture to the bowl, whisking constantly. Pour the egg mixture into the pot of milk, stirring constantly. Do not boil or cook the egg mixture, otherwise you will have scrambled eggs! The mixture should begin to thicken so that coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Remove vanilla pod and discard, and refrigerate until chilled.For the Sponge Cake:Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and lay parchment paper over the bottom of a jelly roll size baking pan (17 1/2 inches by 11 1/2 inches by 1-inch deep). With an electric beater, beat together the egg yolks, just 1/4 cup of the sugar (reserving the rest), and vanilla until the mixture becomes a pale yellow and thickens. Sift cake flour over the egg yolk mixture and set aside briefly. Wash and dry the beaters.In a separate metal bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar together and gradually beat in the balance of the sugar until stiff peaks form. To the egg yolk/flour bowl, fold in 1/3 of the beaten egg whites until just barely combined. Repeat two more times with each of the remaining 2/3 of the beaten egg whites.Spread into jelly roll pan and bake in oven for about 15 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and springs back when touched. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes and loosen the edges with a spatula or butter knife. Then, invert cake onto a similarly sized baking sheet without edges, by holding against the top edges of the jelly roll pan and flipping it over. Peel off parchment paper and let cool completely. Wash the jelly roll pan, to have ready for soaking the cake.For the Strawberries and Whipped Topping:Reserve 18 whole (but cleaned) berries. To begin the maceration process, slice the rest of the berries into a bowl, mix in the sugar, and refrigerate.Whip the heavy cream with an electric beater until stiff peaks form.Cook\\'s Note: Each individual serving will have two layers of cake. You can adjust the serving size based on the way you slice the cake. If serving in martini glasses (as was done on the episode), cut the cake into rectangles which are approximately 3 inches square (a count of 4 across the width of the sheet cake and 6 along the length of the cake). This will yield 24 rectangles for 12 servings. You can also make slightly larger servings if using a flat serving plate by cutting into 12 rectangles which are about 4 inches square.  Return the cake squares to the jelly roll pan and pour the cold tea over them allowing to soak.To assemble:Use a spatula to transfer a slice of cake to each of the serving glasses or plates. Spoon some of the macerated strawberries on top of each cake round and top with vanilla cream. Cover with the second layer of sponge cake, then more strawberries, then more vanilla cream, and top with a dollop of whipped cream around which you will arrange 3 whole strawberries and a sprig of fresh mint."

S'Bring a pot of water to boil for the potatoes. Saute the onion in a small pan in 2 tablespoons of butter until translucent and set aside. Boil the potatoes until tender.While the potatoes are boiling, begin the dough. Whisk together the eggs, 1/4 cup water and sour cream and pour into a small pitcher (or you can actually whisk them right in a container such as a 2-cup glass measuring vessel). Mound the flour in the center of a clean room-temperature work surface like a large wooden cutting board. Create a crater in the center of the mound. Pour enough of the egg mixture into the center to fill the crater. With a fork, gently begin to scramble the mixture within the confines of the crater, whilst integrating the flour from the sides of the crater as you carefully beat the egg mixture. Once this first amount of the egg mixture is mostly mixed in, shore up the sides of the mound again with flour, maintaining the crater shape. Repeat the process with a second pour of egg mixture into the crater, and again until you have combined all the egg mixture. (Remember that making pasta is not an exact science. Depending on the flour, you may need more moisture to make the dough come together, in which case use a little extra milk or water. Conversely, if the dough is too wet, add a little more flour - but just enough to make it the right consistency. This is an acquired skill so be patient with yourself.)  Start kneading the dough with your palms, allowing the warmth of your hands to impart elasticity to the dough. Knead for a count of about 400 strokes or until you feel you have created a cohesive mass. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow it to rest for about 30 minutes.Return to the potatoes, drain, and mash them with the sauteed onion, chives, butter, milk, and salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside.Work with 1/3 of the pasta dough at a time - keeping the balance wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Use a pasta machine to gradually roll each section of the pasta down, successively reducing the setting on the machine until it is at a thickness of 1/16th of an inch.Cut 3-inch circles of pasta, spoon some of the mashed potatoes into the center and fold the filled circles into half moons, sealing the edges with egg wash and pressing shut with your fingers or carefully with the times of a fork.Bring a large shallow saute pan of water to a boil, and gently boil the pierogi in batches for 2 or 3 minutes, removing carefully to a utility platter with a wooden spoon.The final step is to melt the butter in a large fry pan and saute the garlic for a few minutes until it is tender and imparts its flavor to the butter in the pan. Be careful not to burn either the butter or the garlic. Saute the pierogi in this garlic butter and serve.'

S'Melt butter in a saute pan and add apples, cooking over medium heat for a few minutes until they begin to soften. Add apple juice, orange juice and rice wine vinegar, cover and allow the apples to cook until very soft. Then uncover and allow liquid to reduce to about 1/3 of what you started with. Puree in a blender or food processor. Create a slurry by gradually whisking cornstarch into about 1/4 cup water and blend the slurry into the sauce. Return the sauce to the pot and allow to cook for a few minutes to thicken. Season with salt, if needed.Begin the creamed leeks while the apples are cooking.Heat the olive oil and butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat and saute onion until translucent. Deglaze the pan with wine and reduce until the liquid is almost all gone. (While you are waiting for the wine to reduce, start cooking the leeks.) Cook the leeks in simmering water until tender. Drain and set aside. When the wine has mostly evaporated, stir in the cream, season with salt and pepper, and lower heat to a simmer to allow to reduce and thicken. Strain this sauce and pour over the leeks and set aside briefly in a warm place.For the fish:Season the salmon fillets with coarse sea salt and both peppers. Place a little oil into the saute pan and bring to smoking point (you need a hot pan in order to get a crispy outside). Cook the salmon, skin side down leaving undisturbed (no peeking) for about 5 minutes, or until the skin begins to get crispy, then turn and begin cooking for 4 minutes more. This allows the surface of the fish to "caramelize." (You may need more time on the salmon depending on the thickness). You can, if you wish, finish the salmon in a preheated 350 degree F oven. However, DO NOT OVERCOOK THE SALMON. Once you touch the flesh and it springs back up, it\\\'s cooked. Remember, because of carryover cooking, the fish will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven.Reheat the apple butter sauce if necessary. Place 4 lengths of the creamed leeks on one side the serving plate, with a salmon fillet on the other. Spoon apple butter sauce on the fish and garnish with lemon thyme. (Please note: In the episode, since we had the deep- fryer going, we deep-fried some vermicelli pasta for a garnish with a flourish. You can do the same or use lemon thyme.)'

Add lemon zest and juice, peaches, walnuts, and raisins and cinnamon and cook for about 5 more minutes. Stir in brown sugar and flour, remove from heat and gently fold in raspberries, and cool to room temperature.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.While the fruit is cooking, roll puff pastry out on a floured surface. Spoon some of the fruit mixture onto the pastry and begin to roll up the pastry, brushing each fold of pastry with butter and sprinkling some of the sugar as you go. If you are using 2 sheets of puff pastry, you will be making 2 strudel "rolls." Brush each roll with apricot jelly, place on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let cool completely and serve. (This is best served on the day it is made.)'

Allow to marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour under refrigeration.For cooking, preheat a grill or chargrill over high heat.Remove the steak from the marinade, straining any excess marinade. Removal of the excess marinade will prevent flaming or charring of the steak during cooking. Place the steak on the grill and cook over high heat, 8 to 9 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.

S'Chill a medium mixing bowl in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, place the cold water in a small bowl, sprinkle with gelatin and let stand 1 minute. Add boiling water and stir until gelatin is dissolved. Set aside. In the chilled bowl, combine the cocoa powder, salt, whipping cream and vanilla until roughly mixed. With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the cream mixture until it becomes stiff. Do not over-beat or you will end up with chocolate butter. Beat in the gelatin mixture just until combined.  Spoon chocolate mousse into decorative molds, dessert dishes or martini glasses. Refrigerate the molds for 1 to 2 hours. Coating:Cover a sheet pan with waxed paper. Place chocolate chips and shortening in medium heat-proof bowl. In separate large heat-proof bowl, add very warm water (100 to 110 degrees F) to 1-inch depth. Carefully place bowl with chocolate into bowl of water. The water should come halfway up side of chocolate bowl. Stir chocolate and shortening constantly with dry rubber scraper until chocolate and shortening are melted and mixture is smooth. Do not get water into the bowl with chocolate. (If water cools, replace it with very warm water as directed above; water temperature is important to success). Remove chocolate bowl from inside water bowl.  Remove the filling from molds and place on the waxed paper lined sheet pan. Pour chocolate mixture over the filling, and remove excess chocolate from around the filling. Refrigerate coated bombs for 1 to 2 hours before serving. Garnish, as desired.'

S'Bring stock and bay leaves to a boil in a large pot. Cook asparagus until tender and add to stock pot. Melt butter in a separate saucepan and gently saute onions, celery, and carrots (mirepoix) until tender, then gradually add flour (with a non-reactive utensil such as a wooden spoon), and cook until similar to a roux. Transfer to the pot of stock to thicken soup. Let simmer for 45 minutes. Remove bay leaves from soup. *Blend to a puree with an immersion blender, or in batches in a blender or food processor. Add cream to the soup, and keep warm over low heat.For the crab "souffle," mix crab, mayonnaise, thyme, salt and pepper, and squeeze of fresh lemon juice, trying to avoid breaking up the lumps of crabmeat. Place a scoop of the crabmeat in the center of soup bowl and ladle the asparagus soup around. Garnish with a lemon wedge.*When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.'

S'Early in the day, rinse pork loin to remove any unwanted smells and pat dry with paper toweling. In a large saute pan, heat the oil and sear the pork loin on all sides. Remove pork to a utility platter and coat liberally with mustard, then roll in Roasted Garlic Pepper Seasoning. Leave refrigerated for 2 hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Transfer pork to a covered roasting pan or a large saute pan with an oven safe handle, and roast covered in oven until fork tender, at least 45 minutes. (Remember to use oven mitts when removing the pan from oven.) Transfer pork to a utility platter and let rest in a warm place before slicing. Add white wine to the roasting pan and swirl to combine flavors with the juices in the pan. Place roasting pan over medium heat (or transfer to a small saucepan) on the stovetop and let reduce slightly. Add the prepared brown sauce to the roasting pan juices and wine. Cook the gravy for a few minutes to integrate flavors and to thicken. Season with salt and pepper and strain the sauce. Lay slices of pork loin on serving dish and spoon brown sauce over. Garnish with chopped rosemary.'

S'A few hours before beginning the slow cooking of the ribs, make the rub by combining garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, paprika, mustard, and salt in a bowl and mixing well. Rub the mix into the meat and let sit for at least an hour. The mixture will begin to cure the meat. About 30 minutes before beginning to barbecue, heat the grill. Wrap ribs in heavy duty aluminum foil and place on the grill over indirect heat and slowly cook for about 2 hours, turning occasionally.While the ribs are cooking, begin the sauce on the stovetop. Combine apple juice, tomato juice, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and barbecue sauce in a saucepan, stirring to mix well. Simmer over low heat until it beings to thicken. Let simmer for 1/2 hour. Reserve about 1 cup to serve on the side with the ribs, and use the rest to brush on the ribs as they barbecue.When the meat begins to become fork tender, unwrap ribs and begin brushing on the sauce. Continue to apply the sauce to the ribs during the barbeque process. When ribs are able to pull apart, they are ready.'

S'Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. ("Proofing" the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop a foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn\\\'t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes.Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to an hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time.While the dough is proofing, begin to prepare the topping. Melt the butter over medium heat in a pan with a lid. Add apples and stir gently to coat with the warm butter. Combine cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle over the apples. Stir in the lemon juice. Cover and cook over low to medium heat for about 40 minutes, or until the apples are cooked through and tender.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Stretch the dough out into a 14-inch circle which is thicker around the perimeter. Transfer dough to a pizza stone sprinkled with cornmeal. Top evenly with the cooked apple slices. Since the caramel topping and hazelnut, chocolate sauce are thick and awkward to spread, distribute spoonfuls of them evenly over the surface of the apple slices and the heat from the oven will make them melt onto the surface. Sprinkle with mini-marshmallows and drizzle with chocolate syrup. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the dough is nicely browned.'

S'Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.For the gyro meatloaf: Gather the minced onions in a clean kitchen towel and wring out as much liquid as possible. In a large mixing bowl, combine the onion, beef, lamb, milk, breadcrumbs, oregano, thyme, fennel, coriander, egg and some salt and pepper and mix together. Fry up a small test batch; taste for salt and pepper, and adjust the seasoning as needed.Transfer the meatloaf mixture to a food processor and process it to the consistency of a paste. Tightly pack it into a loaf pan, making sure there are no cracks or air pockets. Bake until cooked through, about 45 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting into thin slices.For the tzatziki sauce: Grate or mince the cucumber and add it to a bowl along with the yogurt, dill, lemon juice, mint, olive oil, coriander and cumin. Whisk to blend. Season with salt and pepper.For the lemon vinaigrette: In a blender, combine the lemon juice, oregano, thyme and mustard. With the motor running, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream to emulsify.For the salad: Toss the lettuce, red onions and tomatoes with about 4 tablespoons of the vinaigrette.Heat the 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Briefly warm up the pitas in the pan, giving them just long enough on each side to get hot but not crispy. In the same pan, sear the slices of gyro on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.Spread 1 heaping tablespoon of tzatziki sauce onto each pita. Top with some slices of meatloaf and finish with some of the salad. Roll the pitas up tightly and wrap them in foil or secure them with a toothpick. Serve.'

S'Rinse beef shoulder to remove any unwanted smells, pat dry with paper toweling, and place on a utility platter. In a small bowl, make the rub for the beef by combining Smokey Rotisserie Seasoning and Garlic Pepper. Rub the seasonings into all surfaces of the beef, cover with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours at room temperature. (The seasonings will actually begin to "cure" the meat.)For the sauce:Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan and cook the onions, garlic, and red and green peppers until the onions begin to turn translucent and the peppers begin to soften, being careful not to burn the garlic. Stir in the parsley, basil, and oregano. Add the crushed tomatoes and bay leaf. Over medium heat, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and allow to simmer for about 20 minutes.Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In an oven proof skillet heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat, and sear all sides of beef. Cover pan (with lid or foil) and transfer to oven to finish, bringing to an internal temperature of 115 degrees F, on an instant-read thermometer, for medium-rare (about 30 minutes). Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.Slice beef into steaks, and transfer to serving dish. Reheat pizziola sauce if necessary, remove bay leaf, and spoon over meat. Garnish with the pepperoncini.'

S'The duck has to be prepared the day before because of the long slow cooking time. If you are purchasing a pre-cooked confit of duck, skip the instructions in this paragraph and follow the directions on the package of the product. In any event, you will need to shred the duck for use in this recipe. For your own confit of duck, mix the salt, pepper and garlic together and coat the duck with the seasonings rubbing into the surface of the duck. On the stovetop, heat the oil or lard in a deep roasting pan (if you will be using the oven) or in a large Dutch oven (if you will be cooking on the range). (Note: you will be poaching the duck, not frying it, so, it is important to avoid making the oil too hot.) Add the duck to the warm oil. If you are using the oven, put the duck in a preheated 200 degree F oven for about 6 to 8 hours. If you are using the stovetop, cook the duck at a simmer. In either case, the duck must be cooked until it falls away from the bone. Remove all the duck meat from the bones and reserve meat until needed.Cut the endive in half and remove the core. Lightly sear the cut sides of the endive in olive oil over medium heat in a nonstick pan. Sprinkle in the sugar, salt, pepper, and butter - cover and continue to cook until al dente - about 10 minutes. You want the endive to be slightly tender, but firm enough to support the duck filling. Season with salt and pepper, remove from heat, and let cool.Prepare the mango/berry puree by adding the mango and strawberries to a blender or food processor and blending until smooth.If duck is cold, heat or re-heat it, depending on whether you have made your own confit, or have purchased it prepared. Shred the duck with 2 forks.Fill each endive-half with duck, spoon mango berry puree on top and garnish with a raspberry. Serve slightly warm.'

Remove the pork and jalapenos from the pot to a bowl and set aside. In the same pot used to cook the meat, add the remaining 1/4 cup of the canola oil, butter, and onion. Cook for 2 minutes or until the onion starts to soften. Stir in the salt, cumin, paprika, cayenne, and black pepper and cook until the onion is soft. Mix in the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low. Sprinkle the flour over the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Slowly pour the enchilada sauce into the onion mixture, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Mix in the green salsa and water. Return the cooked pork and jalapenos to the pot. Increase the heat to medium and slowly bring the chili to a boil. When the chili boils, reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Before serving remove from heat and stir in the chopped cilantro and lime juice. The consistency should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, if not simmer longer or thicken with a little cornstarch slurry.Serve with cooked rice.'

S'For the slaw: In a bowl, blend the vinegar and wasabi, and then add the cabbage and onions. Allow this mixture to marinate, or soak, for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. This marinating will soften the cabbage and onions without cooking, thus preserving the nutrients of the vegetables. Once marinated, we will hold the slaw until building the tacos.For the dressing: Slice the avocado in half, remove the seed and scoop the "meat" of the avocado into a small mixing bowl. Next, with a spoon, mash the avocado until smooth. Add the sambal, tomato, cilantro and salt to taste. Mix well, then cover and hold until serving.For the bison: Warm the pulled meat with the stock in a saucepan over medium-high heat until warmed. Once warm, remove from the heat, discard any remaining liquid and keep the meat warm to build the tacos.Construction: Drain the cabbage from the marinade and add 1 tablespoon slaw to each tortilla. Then add the bison and finish with 1 tablespoon tomato avocado dressing.'

Transfer the mixture to a piece of parchment paper and roll into a cigar shape about 1 1/2 inches thick. Refrigerate until ready to use.For the pork: Slice the loin into  3/4-inch thick slices, and then one by one, cover with plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until each slice is flat and even (about a 1/4-inch thick).Season the flour with salt and pepper, and then dredge the pork in the seasoned flour.Heat the oil in a heavy bottom saucepan over medium-high heat. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Once the oil has heated, add the floured pork to the pan and allow to cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce the heat, flip, add some thyme and parsley, and repeat the process on the second side until finished cooking, 2 to 3 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the pan and keep warm. Repeat the process until all the pork is cooked.For the asparagus: Bring a pot of water to a boil and add salt. Trim the woody bottoms of the asparagus and peel the stalks. Blanch in the boiling water until bright green, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the water and season with salt and pepper.Place asparagus in the center of a serving plate, arrange the pieces of cooked pork on top, and top with a 1/4-inch disk of sundried tomato butter. Garnish with parsley. Store the remaining butter wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator.'

S"For the fritters: In heavy bottomed pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil and cook the bacon, onions, and celery until golden brown, and stir throughout the cooking with a wooden spoon.Turn the heat to low and slowly stir in the thyme, garlic, and lemon juice. Continue to cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Add half the beans and smash with a masher or fork until semi-smooth.Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Stir in the remaining beans and blend well with a spoon. Stir in the parsley, baking powder, flour, egg, cheese, and some salt and pepper. The mixture should be moist to the touch, not watery. You can add more flour if the mixture looks runny, just stir in a little bit at a time until it thickens. Place the fritter mixture in the refrigerator to chill.Pour the oil into a cast iron skillet or deep saute pan, filling the pan 1/4-inch up the sides. Bring the oil to 350 degrees F (use an oil thermometer).For the topping, stir a few shakes of hot sauce into the mayonnaise. Taste it. You want some heat, but not too spicy.In a bowl, whisk together the cornmeal and flour. Remove the batter from the fridge.Spoon 1 tablespoon of the batter into the cornmeal-flour mixture and roll it around to coat. Carefully drop into the hot oil. Cook until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Turn the fritters as you\\'re cooking them to cover them carefully with oil. Cook a few fritters at a time but don\\'t crowd the pan.Remove the cooked fritters to paper towels to drain. Serve them hot with a bit of spicy mayo on top. Garnish with chopped chives."

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.To bread the chicken, blend the flour, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Then dust the chicken on both sides with the seasoned flour, coating well. In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the grapeseed oil and allow to heat. Then add the floured chicken, skin-side down, cooking until slightly browned. This will take 4 to 5 minutes, then flip and repeat the process on the bottom side, again for 4 to 5 minutes. Once browned, finish the chicken in the oven until the internal temperature reaches 160 to 165 degrees F, about 6 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven, keep the chicken warm on a covered plate and discard any excess oil from the pan.Return the pan to medium heat, splash or deglaze with the wine, allowing to dissipate. Next, add the onions, stir and cook until the onions are slightly translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Next, add the lemon juice and garlic, stir again and cook until warmed. Finally, remove from the heat, stir in the parsley and butter to finish the sauce. Serve over the chicken.'

S'Make "sausage" mixture by mixing venison, pork, eggs, parsley, thyme, rosemary, onion, and salt and pepper, to taste. Saute sausage mixture over medium-high heat on the stovetop until browned, using a wooden spoon to keep the texture of the mixture "fine" (not chunky) while cooking. Drain the meat mixture well and set aside to cool.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out each puff pastry sheet and cut each of the 4 sheets into 4 squares, yielding 16 squares. (These will be 4 1/2 or 5-inch square.)  Spread the "sausage" mixture, over the surface of each of the 16 squares and roll up the dough "jelly roll" style (so the cross-section of the roll will be a spiral design), seal dough on the ends by crimping, and place on a baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, approximately 15 minutes, until golden brown.'

Remove the sheet cake and ice cream from the freezer. Using some of the meringue as a "glue" position the pre-cut pieces of cake to fit the sides and the ends of the brick of ice cream. Then spread the rest of the meringue in a thick layer over the entire assembly, swirling it decoratively with the back of a spoon, and being sure to cover the lower edge of the cake on all sides so the meringue touches the pan base. Slide the Alaska into the oven and bake until the meringue browns, 5 or 10 minutes. Serve immediately with accompaniments of chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce, and caramel sauce.'

S"Rinse meat to remove residue and pat dry with paper towels. Prepare a rub by combining cayenne, paprika, chili powder, fajita seasoning, and Smokey Rotisserie seasoning in a small bowl. Squeeze lemon juice into bowl to make a paste and rub over entire surface of prime rib. Follow manufacturer\\'s instructions for the smoker. General rule of thumb is to maintain a temperature range of 255 to 300 degrees F (indirect heat), and smoke for 1 to 1 1/2 hours per pound of meat.For the Horseradish Cream:Beat heavy cream with an electric beater until stiff peaks form. Squeeze in lemon juice, 1/2 of lemon at a time, and beat in until incorporated. Then gradually beat in horseradish and salt and pepper. Chill for about an hour before serving. Slice down prime rib and serve with horseradish cream."

S'Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.For the pesto crust:Blend sun-dried tomatoes, garlic cloves and basil leaves in a food processor. Stir in Parmesan and add salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside briefly. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season chicken breast with pepper only. (The Parmesan in the pesto will provide salt.) Brown both sides of chicken, beginning with skin side first. Coat chicken with pesto and roast in oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until fork tender.For the polenta:Combine chicken stock and cream in a large heavy saucepan. Heat to a gentle boil over medium heat, being careful not to burn. While whisking constantly, gradually add the cornmeal in a thin stream. Once cornmeal is incorporated, keep heat low and continue to whisk until mixture is slightly thickened and creamy. Stir in butter and Cheddar and allow cheese to melt. Season with pepper, (and salt if needed).  Spoon polenta onto serving plate, top with chicken breast and garnish with chopped scallions.'

S'In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, add milk, rice and salt. Cook the rice at a low simmer until the rice is tender, do not boil. Once you achieve "simmer," the rice should take around 20 to 30 minutes to be ready, depending on your cooker. Taste the rice to make sure it is tender. Remember to keep stirring so the rice doesn\\\'t stick to the bottom. Once the mixture has cooked, remove from heat and add sugar, vanilla, raisins and egg yolks.  Keep stirring to incorporate all of the flavors, then let it sit for about 10 minutes. The sugar and vanilla will infuse very quickly, giving a flowery aroma. Add the heavy cream and butter, mixing them well together in the saucepan. Spoon into ramekins or individual serving bowls. Rice pudding can be served warm, room temperature or chilled. This particular recipe benefits from setting overnight in the refrigerator. Sprinkle with cinnamon, if desired.'

S'Trim the beef of excess fat, salt it and set aside. Make a marinade by combining red wine, vinegar, water, onions, peppercorns, juniper berries, bay leaves and cloves in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Let this marinade cool to room temperature. Place the beef in the now cooled marinade, cover, and refrigerate, overnight if possible, but for at least 2 hours.Remove the meat from the marinade and set aside on a utility platter. Strain the marinade into a pot, bring to a boil, and skim, then reduce to a simmer.Heat the oil in a large saute pan. Add the beef and sear it on all sides, then remove to a utility platter. Combine the carrots, onion, and celery in the same pan to make a mirepoix. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, deglaze pan with a small amount of the warmed marinade, then add the tomato paste and continue cooking for another 2 to 3 minutes. Add a bit more of the warmed marinade to the saute pan to de-glaze, and reduce heat to medium. Add the flour gradually until a paste is formed. Then, slowly add all of the warmed marinade to the mixture, similar to making a roux. If the sauce is too thick, which can sometimes happen due to density of flour, gradually add chicken or vegetable stock until you reach the consistency where it coats the back of a spoon. Return the meat to the pan, cover and simmer until fork-tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Remove meat and let rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing. Strain the sauce, place slices of meat on serving plate, spoon sauce around and garnish with steamed vegetables and dollops of sour cream. Serve with cooked egg noodles as an accompaniment.'

Once the dough is rolled out, sprinkle the mushrooms in the center, leaving a 2-inch border on all sides. Top with the beef, followed by half the cheese, then the chicken, in a stacked fashion. Top with the herbs, tomato sauce, and remaining cheese. Brush the edges with some of the egg wash. Fold the bottom and top edges over the filling, then fold the sides over twice, 1-inch at a time, resulting in a 6 by 14-inch tube. Brush the outside of the stromboli with the remaining egg wash, place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, and bake until firm and golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.

S'Soak morels in 3 cups very hot water for 30 minutes to re-hydrate. Lift them carefully from the hot water in order to leave any grit behind in the liquid. Discard the liquid, and dry the morels lightly with paper towels. Cut morels crosswise into 1/4-inch to 3/8-inch wide slices and set aside. Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in flour, and shake off excess. Heat half the clarified butter (1/8 cup) in a large saute pan, and cook the chicken over medium heat for about 8 to 10 minutes. Flip the chicken and brown on the second side, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove to an ovenproof casserole dish. Add the rest of the clarified butter (the other 1/8 cup) to the same saute pan, add the morels and button mushrooms, and cook gently over low heat for 2 minutes. Then add the Madeira and reduce the liquid by half.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.When the liquid is reduced, add the beef stock and heavy cream and bring to a gentle boil. Let the mushroom sauce cook until mixture starts to thicken, about 5 to 10 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken and bake covered in the oven until done, about 25 to 35 minutes.

In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella and the romano.Build your lasagna in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish: Start with a layer of sauce, then top with a layer of noodles. Evenly spread half of the pumpkin filling, then half of the zucchini, over the noodles. Top with half of the cheese mixture and cover with some of the sauce. Repeat the layers, finishing with noodles and sauce; sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake, uncovered, 35 to 40 minutes, or until bubbly. Let cool 15 minutes before slicing.Photograph by Ngoc Minh Ngo'

S'Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.Brush olive oil on the peppers, and place them cut side down on a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil (with the edges turned up to avoid drips.) Roast until charred, them remove them to a resealable plastic bag or tightly covered pan to sweat and cool down.Make the vinaigrette just before use. Through the feed opening of a running blender, add vinegar and garlic. With the blender still running, pour olive oil in a slow thin stream. (Alternatively, you can prepare the vinaigrette by whisking the ingredients into a bowl in the same order, in which case, the garlic should be minced first.)Return to the bell peppers and peel off the blackened skin. Slice the flesh of the peppers brunoise (julienne, then crosswise) and place in a mixing bowl. Fold in the drained black-eyed peas, scallions, and parsley. Stir in enough of the vinaigrette to coat. Serve family style.'

When shrimp begins to turn pink, douse with white wine to de-glaze pan and squeeze just 1/2 of the lemon over the shrimp (reserving the other half for later), then transfer shrimp to a utility platter, cover and set aside in a warm place.Reduce heat to medium and to the liquids in the pan, add just 3 tablespoons of the fresh basil (reserving balance for garnish), capers, red bell pepper, jalapeno, and white mushrooms and cook for about 5 to 8 minutes to integrate flavors. Then, add the can of tomatoes in puree and allow to cook, partially covered, for about 25 minutes to reduce and thicken, seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste, as needed.While the sauce is reducing, bring 2 1/2 cups water to boil. Add the rice along with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon butter. Return to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes leaving undisturbed. Then remove from heat and leave rice covered for an additional 5 minutes.Remove sauce from heat and stir in cream. Reserve 4 pieces of shrimp for garnish and stir rest of shrimp into sauce. Place rice in center of serving dish. Spoon sauce with shrimp onto rice, and garnish with 4 reserved pieces of shrimp. Squeeze remaining 1/2 of lemon over shrimp.

Add the milk and enough water to cover by 1-inch. Cook uncovered over medium heat for 45 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. When fish is cool enough to handle, shred the fish into a bowl, taking care to get all the bones out. Add onion, parsley, and tomatoes. In a separate bowl, whisk together olive oil, vinegar, lime juice, and salt and pepper. Add the dressing to the cod salad, toss and serve.'

When the onions become translucent add the mushrooms and toss until all mushrooms are golden brown and caramelized. Remove from the heat. Add butter and thyme and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve immediately.Cook\\'s Note: Never run mushrooms directly under water; they will absorb water like a sponge, and your saute will be far too soggy. Instead, using a slightly damp paper towel, wipe mushrooms down. Alternatively, use pastry brush and dust the dirt from the mushrooms."

S'Roll out 2 pastry sheets to 1/2-inch thickness and set aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to rest prior to assembly. (This will make it easier to handle). At this time preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.When ready to assemble, lay 1 of the pastry sheets on a flat floured surface. Brush with egg wash and evenly spread the spinach on top. Then cover the spinach with the sauteed mushrooms.Lay the whole side of salmon on top of the spinach and mushrooms, making sure you have at least 1/2-inch of pastry left all around the salmon.Preheat oven at 350 degrees F.Season the salmon with salt and pepper and top with the chopped eggs and sliced raw onion.Sprinkle with chopped dill and thyme and brush the egg wash liberally around the edges of the bottom pastry. Place the other pastry sheet on top of the salmon and press the 2 sheets together so they seal tightly (the whole thing should look like a parcel). Egg wash the top and sprinkle with little salt. Transfer the salmon to a sheet pan and place in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes check internal temperature by placing an instant-read thermometer into the center of the salmon. When it reads 125 degrees F remove from the oven and allow to rest for a further 10 minutes. It will continue to cook for a further 20 minutes or so.Transfer salmon to a cutting board and using a serrated knife, slice into 2-inch pieces. Place on a serving platter and enjoy.'

S'For the cod: Preheat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. Then bread each medallion of fish with flour mixed with seafood seasoning. Tap off excess, and then dip in egg wash and finish in breadcrumbs, ensuring to coat evenly. After breading the fish, drop in the preheated oil and cook in batches until golden brown, flipping during the process. This should take 2 to 3 minutes. After frying, remove the fish from the oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and place on paper towels. Allow the fish to drain excess oil.For the sandwiches: Heat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat until warmed. During heating, with the softened butter, spread 1 tablespoon evenly on the top and bottom of 1 bun, and then toast in the pan until browned, about 2 minutes. After the first bun, reduce the heat to medium and repeat the process with the remaining buns.To build the sandwiches, stack the bottom bun, spread tarter on the bottom bun, then add some lettuce, fish, pickles and finish with the top bun. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches.'

S"For the potatoes: Peel the potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan of cold, salted water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. When the water boils, lower the heat to medium and simmer the potatoes until they\\'re fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes.For the venison: Season both sides of the venison tenderloins with salt and pepper.Heat a large saute pan over high heat and add the oil. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the tenderloins. Reduce the heat to medium and sear the tenderloins on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the loins from the pan and let rest until ready to serve.For the potatoes: Drain the potatoes well and transfer to a bowl. Mash the potatoes until there are no lumps. Stir in the butter, nutmeg, cream, salt, and white pepper. Stir until creamy, adding more cream if needed. You want smooth, creamy potatoes. Taste and season with more salt and white pepper, if needed.For the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine all of the ingredients, except for the blueberries and butter. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat, add the blueberries, and simmer until reduced a little and thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, strain the sauce back into the saucepan, season with salt and pepper, and then whisk in the butter. Hold warm until serving.To plate: Spoon potatoes into the center of the plate. Slice the venison loin into    1/2-inch thick slices on a bias. Lay slices over potatoes. Top with sauce."

S'Microwave limes in a small bowl to release essential oils. Since these will be hot coming from the microwave, set them aside until just cool enough to handle. Season fish with salt and pepper and place in a non-reactive container for marinating. Squeeze lime juice over fish and add rinds to the bowl. Pour tequila over fillets, cover and let marinate in refrigerator for at least 2 hours.About 20 to 25 minutes before mealtime, prepare orange beurre blanc by combining orange juice and wine in a saucepan and simmering on medium heat until reduced by half the volume. Stir in heavy cream, bring to a gentle simmer, and allow to reduce and thicken over low heat. Stir in parsley and set aside briefly in a warm place.Heat oil over medium heat in a large saute pan and add butter. Sear marinated fillets flesh side first, leaving undisturbed for at least 2 to 3 minutes to allow the surface to begin to caramelize and prevent tearing of the fish. Flip over to sear the skin side. Allow to cook for 5 to 8 minutes or until flesh springs back when gently prodded. Remove to a tray and let rest.Whisk butter into sauce just before serving and spoon over and around the fish.'

S'Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Pour the oil into a metal roasting pan and put it in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes to heat up the pan and condition it with the oil. Spread the bones out on the roasting pan and cook until browned, 30 to 45 minutes, turning the bones occasionally so they brown evenly.Transfer the bones to a large-enough stockpot to accommodate the bones, 6 quarts ice water and more. Use tongs to transfer the bones so you do not pour any fat into the stockpot. Add the ice water to the stockpot and bring to a simmer. Allow the stock to cook for 4 hours at a slow simmer. Skim the surface of the stock occasionally to remove any fat or impurities.While the stock is simmering, discard all but about 1/4 cup of the fat from the roasting pan. Bring the pan back up to temperature over high heat on the stovetop. Add the onions and carrots and cook until golden brown and caramelized. Add the celery and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme and bay leaf and cook, stirring regularly, until the tomato paste gets a brick red color, about 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the red wine and stir it into the mirepoix (vegetable) mixture.Add the mirepoix mixture to the stock after the 4-hour simmering time. Bring the stock back up to a simmer and continue to cook it for another 2 hours.In a separate pot, bring the remaining 7 cups red wine to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes.When the stock has simmered for 6 hours, strain it through a chinois and combine the strained stock with the reduced red wine. Bring the stock to a boil, lower the heat to a hard simmer and reduce the stock until it has a consistency that coats the back of spoon and is about 2 quarts (8 cups) in volume, up to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper and then strain the sauce though a chinois again.'

S'Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. To a 1-gallon plastic bag add paprika, ground thyme, salt, ground black pepper, basil, and chili powder, and shake to combine. Add the crawfish and shrimp to the bag in batches and shake to coat. Add the crawfish and shrimp a little at a time to the boiling water so as not to stop the boil, and let cook until pink and the crawfish is curled. As they are cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove the crawfish and shrimp to a platter and set aside until they are cool enough to handle. Remove the shells from the crawfish and shrimp and add the shells back to the pot of cooking liquid, and allow to reduce by two-thirds. (The shells of crawfish are removed by cracking the tail with both hands and forcing it back out through the curve of the tail.) Reserve the crawfish and shrimp meat until needed. When reduced, strain the cooking liquid into a bowl.For the sauce:In another saucepan, combine the garlic, scallions, bay leaf, nutmeg, if using, and butter over medium heat. Add flour to make a roux and allow it to cook until blond, then begin whisking in the milk. Into the bowl of reduced seafood cooking liquid, whisk the Cheddar and Gruyere cheeses. Add this to the milk mixture and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make a topping by adding bread crumbs, parsley leaves, Parmesan, Cheddar, Cajun seasoning, horseradish, and hard boiled eggs to a small bowl and combining with a wooden spoon.Fold the crawfish and shrimp into the sauce a little at a time so you can control the amount of sauce to the amount of seafood. (Do not feel compelled to use all of the sauce.) Spread the mixture into a 3 quart casserole dish. Sprinkle with the topping and heat about 5 minutes in the oven until the topping is browned. Serve family style, garnished with parsley sprigs.'

S'Special equipment: a spice grinder and an immersion blenderFor the vegan meatballs: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Heat a large saute pan over high heat. Add the grapeseed oil and then the eggplant, onions and garlic and saute until the eggplant and onions are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.Add the salt, pepper and chili flakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the sauteed vegetables from the pan and let cool.Combine the cooled sauteed vegetables, white beans and parsley in a bowl and mix well. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse until the mixture is mostly pureed with some small chunks.Grind the oats in a spice grinder until a fine flour. Mix the oat flour into the pureed mixture. The mixture should hold together in a ball, if it is too wet add more oat flour.Form the mixture into 2 1/2- to 3-ounce balls and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until browned and hot in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.For the spaghetti squash: Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Drizzle the flesh with the grapeseed oil and season with the salt and pepper.Place the squash halves cut-side down in a casserole dish. Add 1/2 cup water to the dish and cover with foil. Bake until the flesh is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.Remove the squash from the oven and, while it is still hot, scoop the flesh out with a fork. Season with salt and pepper and hold for plating.For the tomato sauce: Combine the whole tomatoes, onion, basil, olive oil, garlic and oregano in a large pot. Puree with an immersion blender. Add the diced tomatoes and bring the sauce to a simmer over high heat. Stir in the tomato paste, season with the salt and pepper and simmer for 15 minutes.To plate: Strain the liquid off the spaghetti squash and divide the squash among 6 plates. For each plate, place 3 vegan meatballs on top of the spaghetti squash and top with 6 ounces of tomato sauce. Garnish with the chopped parsley.'

S'For the tom toms: In a small mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, parsley, garlic and oregano until blended. Next, in a separate mixing bowl, blend lightly by hand the beef, pork and veal, ensuring not to overwork or over blend. Then add the herbed eggs to the blended meats, again mixing by hand, and then finish with the panko. Mix for a final time to bind the meats and eggs, then hold in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes, or until usage.For the Parmesan cream: In a saucepan over medium heat, add the cream and chicken base, simmering until slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Once thickened and reduced, add the cheese and parsley, reduce the heat and cook for a final 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and hold warm.After resting the tom tom meat, portion into 1-inch round balls, then hold cold until cooking.In a 3-quart saucepan over high heat, bring the oil to 350 degrees F, then reduce the heat to medium-high. Fry the toms toms 10 to 12 at a time until the interior temperature reaches 160 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat the process until all the tom toms are cooked. Once cooked, add the tom toms to a large mixing bowl and blend with the cream sauce, tossing to coat. Remove from the sauce and skewer each with a 6-inch skewer to serve.'

S'Clarify butter by melting it in a very small pot or metal container over low heat and scooping out the foam that rises. Then, spoon off the clear butterfat to a clean bowl or container, being careful not to disturb the water or milk solids at the bottom. The clear portion is clarified butter. Set this aside briefly in a warm place. Combine the egg yolks, lemon juice, white pepper, and salt in a blender and process at high speed for about 60 seconds. Leaving the blender running, pour the clarified butter through the feed opening of the blender in a slow steady stream and mix until thickened. Pour into a shallow plate. Dip each asparagus spear into the sauce so that three-fourths of the stick is covered to hold prosciutto in place, then wrap a slice of prosciutto over the sauce on each asparagus spear, leaving a dry end for guests to serve themselves.'

S"For the bangers: Using a meat grinder or food mill, grind the shrimp, lobster and garlic together into a large bowl. Then add the parsley, tarragon, seafood seasoning, salt, pepper, nutmeg, egg white and lemon juice to the bowl. Mix well with a spoon, ensuring not to over mix. TIP: Take a small bit of the mix and put it in boiling water for a second, take it out and make sure the seasoning is good. If you need more salt or pepper, this is the time to do it, before you fill the casings.To prepare the sausages, poke a small hole at the end of your casing, and then tie end of casing toward end of casing. Next, fill the casing according to the instructions that come with the equipment you are using, or with a pastry bag. While filling, twist or tie the casing every 5 to 6 inches to form each link until end of the casing, and then tie off the casing.To poach the sausages, in a large saucepan, bring water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the links and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Then remove the sausages, repeat the process with the remaining sausages and then let rest to cool. To sear or crust the sausages, in a saute pan over high heat, add 1 teaspoon of oil, sear the sausages on all four sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side, and then repeat the process until all the sausages have been cooked.While sausages are cooling, begin to prepare your potatoes. In a 1 gallon pot, bring 10 cups water to a boil. Then add the potatoes and cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes. After cooking, remove from the water and strain. Then, using a ricer, process the potatoes through the ricer (or a food mill) into a bowl. If you don\\'t have a ricer or food mill, you can use mixer with a whisk attachment, mixing on high to smooth. After ricing the potatoes, add the butter and season with salt and pepper. Finish with heavy cream, stirring in.For the sauce: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the orange juice and onions and bring to a simmer. Reduce the juice to 1/2 cup, and then stir in the horseradish. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter to finish. Hold warm until serving.For the sprouts: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the oil and warm. Then add the bacon and cook for 2 minutes, stirring throughout. Next, add the onions and again cook for 2 minutes; the onions should be softened. Next, deglaze the pan with wine. Stir and add the Brussels sprouts, cooking until browned on edges, 8 to 9 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.To serve, place potatoes on plates and top with Brussels sprouts, then sausage. Drizzle with the sauce and finish with tarragon."

S'For the polenta: Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat, and then reduce the heat to medium. Next, add the cornmeal and cook with a stirring motion until thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Next, reduce the heat to low, add the butter, parsley and thyme and finish cooking until the cream has been absorbed, 3 to 4 minutes. The polenta should be semi-tight and creamy; liquid levels will vary with the moistness of the cornmeal.For the sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the veal stock to a simmer. Then add the cream and garlic. Reduce the heat to medium and allow further simmering for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and hold for plating.For the scallops: Add the oil to a large saute pan over high heat and bring to verge of smoking. During this process, place paper towels down on a flat counter, and then place the scallops on the towels and pat dry.Mix the salt and pepper together. Once the pan is hot, sprinkle both sides of the scallops with the salt and pepper mixture. Then add to pan and sear the first side, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat and flip to sear the second side for a final 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Once cooked, remove the scallops from the pan and serve atop the polenta. Finish with the demi-glace sauce and garnish with chives'

S"For the dough: Sift the flours and a pinch of salt into a bowl. Whisk together the eggs, oil, and 2 tablespoons water in a separate bowl. Pour the flour mixture onto a clean dry work surface and form a small well in the center. Pour half of the egg mixture into the well and, using a fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture. Once absorbed, incorporate the remaining egg mixture and knead by hand until all of the liquid is absorbed, 5 to 6 minutes, flouring your work surface as needed to ensure the dough doesn't stick. Roll the dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.For the filling: Mix together all of the ingredients until fully incorporated in a bowl. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes, or up to 1 hour.To assemble: Divide the rested dough into 2 equal-size pieces and roll out on a floured work surface to a thickness of 1/8-inch. On 1 dough sheet, distribute tablespoon-sized portions of the filling, at least 2 inches apart. Brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash. Carefully lay the second sheet of dough on top and press the edges shut with your fingertips. Use a round 1 1/2-inch ravioli cutter to portion out ravioli pieces, pinching the edges shut to ensure no air is trapped inside.In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F.Whisk the remaining 3 eggs and cream in a shallow bowl. Place the breadcrumbs and Parmesan into another shallow bowl and stir to combine. Dredge the ravioli in the egg mixture, followed by the breadcrumb mixture. Working in batches, carefully drop the ravioli into the saucepan and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, making sure that the oil comes back up to temperature in between batches. Place directly onto a cooling rack lined with aluminum foil to drain any excess oil.Serve with warm tomato sauce and freshly grated Parmesan."

S'Cut salmon in small pieces, about 1/4-inch thick. Set aside or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Slice cucumber into very thin (almost transparent) rounds and set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the shallots, dill, chives, capers, lemon juice and finally add the salmon. Cover and refrigerate if not using immediately. Just before serving, chop the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and a sprinkling of olive oil, and stir to combine. On a serving plate, spread the cucumber slices to cover 2/3 of the plate, leaving a space in the center of the plate. Then arrange the salmon over the cucumber, then top with the seasoned tomatoes. Garnish with sliced avocado and chopped chives. Serve with endive, toast points or crackers.'

Pour off most of the oil from skillet, leaving only a coating. Add the apples and raisins and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the veal stock and cinnamon. Swirl butter into the apple mixture to make a sweet and savory apple compote. Spoon some apple compote into the center of each of 6 plates. Place 2 pork medallions on top of apples, and spoon a little more compote on top of pork. Crumble cheese and place on top of apples so their warmth slowly melts the cheese and then serve.'

S"For the meatballs: Place the chicken thighs, eggs, celery salt, and white pepper in a food processor. Pulse until the meat is ground but still a little bit chunky. Do not make a smooth paste!Transfer the chicken mixture to a bowl. Stir together the breadcrumbs and blue cheese until combined.Fill a small bowl with water. To form the meatballs, wet your hands a little and shape the mixture into 1-inch balls. Lay the meatballs on a sheet tray.Heat a large, deep pan over medium-high heat and add the oil to fill about 1/4-inch up the sides. Do not fill the pan completely with oil.Pour the flour into a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Roll each meatball in the flour to give it a light coating.When the oil is hot, add the meatballs and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Flip the meatballs halfway through cooking. You may have to cook them in batches if they don\\'t fit in the pan, adding more oil if needed. Drain the cooked meatballs on a paper towel-lined plate.For the sauce: Combine the tomato juice, rice wine vinegar, hot sauce, celery salt, white pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the oil until well blended and slightly thickened.For serving: Transfer half the meatballs to a large bowl. Pour some of the sauce over top, just enough to coat the meatballs. Gently toss the meatballs around to coat in the sauce. Using tongs, transfer the meatballs to serving plate and insert a toothpick. Repeat with remaining meatballs.Pour the remaining sauce into a small bowl and serve as a dipping sauce."

S"Peel the potatoes and rinse to remove any traces of dirt. Cut into the potatoes into uniform pieces. (This will help in cooking time if they are all similar.) Take a sharp knife and beginning on 1 end, cut about 2/3 through the potato. Repeat the same incision from 1 end of the potato to the other, spacing the cuts uniformly. (The idea is to create the look of a fan, which is why you don\\'t cut all the way through the potato.)Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Add a pinch of salt and cook until just tender. (Do not overcook. The potatoes should remain a little hard, as they will continue to cook during roasting.)Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Drain the potatoes and place them on absorbent toweling to remove excess water. Mix the flour and salt and pepper, to taste, in a bowl and carefully toss with the already blanched potatoes. Place the floured potatoes onto a baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Bake until golden brown, approximately 30 to 40 minutes.To finish, scoop the potatoes with a slotted spoon onto absorbent paper toweling and to drain any excess oil. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the parsley."

Once the oil is heated and the dough has rested, portion out the dough to 3-ounce portions and fry until golden brown, flipping once during cooking to ensure even cooking. Once cooked for 5 minutes, remove and place on a plate with a paper towel covering. Repeat the process, and then finish with the glaze and dust with powdered sugar.'

S"Melt half of the butter in a saute pan (reserving the other 1/4 cup) over medium-high heat, and saute onion until it caramelizes. Add the mushrooms and cook until they become tender and give up their juices. Strain and set aside. In another saucepan whisk together demi-glace, tomato paste, and red wine and simmer over low heat, allowing to reduce and thicken. (Begin okra and steak as directed below.) Just before serving sauce, whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup of cubed butter, and add mushroom-onion mixture. Taste and add salt and pepper, to taste.For the okra:Heat oil in deep fryer to 375 degrees F, or as instructed in manufacturer\\'s directions. Shake cornstarch, salt and pepper in a plastic bag and add okra, shaking to coat. Deep-fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and re-season with salt and pepper while the oil is still glistening.For the steaks:Melt butter in grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet and cook steaks for about 1 minute on each side. Remove to a utility platter and let rest briefly. Strain pan juices into the pot of sauce and whisk in.Just before serving finish sauce as directed above.

S'For the chicken: Heat a seasoned grill or nonstick pan until warmed and add some oil if using. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with the salt and pepper. Cook the breasts for 2 minutes on the first side, and then flip and cook for 2 minutes more. Flip again to the first side and cook 2 minutes. Flip one last time and cook for 2 minutes more (the total cooking time will be 8 minutes). Allow the chicken to rest and cool before slicing on the bias, cutting four to five slices from each breast.For the mayo: Whisk together the mayonnaise, lemon juice, chipotle puree and salt in a medium bowl, mixing well.For the wraps: Apply about 1 tablespoon of the mayo to the center of each tortilla. Next, add some lettuce, sliced chicken, tomato and avocado, and then fold the ends in to the center to seal. Finally, bring the flap side of each tortilla over and roll to create sealed sandwich wraps. Slice on the bias and serve.'
