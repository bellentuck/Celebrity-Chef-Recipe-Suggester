S"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.For the crust: In a food processor, add the flour and a nice pinch of salt. Pulse very lightly just to blend. Add the butter evenly around the flour and quickly pulse until the flour resembles small crumbles. Slowly pour the water through the spout until the dough begins to come together. Remove and quickly form into a disc. Tightly cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, for the filling: In a large bowl, add the blueberries, apples, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine and set aside.Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured surface. Gently roll the disc into a circle big enough to fit into the pie pan and leave a 3-inch overhang. The dough should be about 1/8-inch thick. Using a pizza cutter, trim the edges of the dough. Place the dough into the pie pan and press gently against the bottom and sides to fit the dough into the pan. Pour in the fruit filling, and then scatter the butter evenly around the top of the pie. Fold the extra dough that\\'s hanging off the edge over the top to create the top of the pie crust. Leave a hole in the center for ventilation.Whisk the egg with 1 teaspoon water and brush the top with egg wash and then sprinkle with the sugar.Place in the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let the pie rest at least an hour before serving to let the filling set."

S"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Prepare the hens: In a mini food processor, pulse the garlic and 1 teaspoon salt to a paste. Using your fingers, make a pocket between the flesh and the skin of each Cornish hen. Stuff half the garlic paste between the skin and the flesh of the hens, evenly covering by pushing the paste along the flesh from the outside. Rub both hens all over with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and a grind of pepper. Cross the legs of each hen and tie together with kitchen string. Set aside and allow to come to room temperature for about an hour.In a baking dish large enough to hold both hens, mix together the remaining garlic paste, the bell pepper, onions, cayenne pepper, paprika, a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of pepper.Place the prepared hens on top of the vegetables in the pan and slowly pour in 2 cups chicken stock. Place in the oven and cook until the temperature reaches 160 degrees F between the leg and the body of the hen when tested with an instant-read thermometer, about 40 minutes.Remove the hens from oven and remove from the pan to a plate. Cover lightly with aluminum foil to keep them warm while making the gravy. In a medium saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the vegetables from the baking dish and the flour. Whisk the flour briskly until it is combined with all the pan contents. Add the wine and let reduce. Take a sip of wine for yourself; you\\'ve worked hard. Stir in the remaining 1 cup chicken stock. Taste and season with salt and pepper, and then cook until the sauce has thickened to a gravy consistency, about 5 more minutes. To serve, remove the aluminum foil from the hens. Remove the string and cut in the birds in half. Pour the gravy over the top and garnish with chopped parsley."

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Wash the chicken and pat dry. In a baking dish large enough to hold the chicken in 1 layer, mix together the lemon juice, brown sugar, oil, garlic, paprika, garam masala, ginger, turmeric, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Arrange the chicken in a single layer in the baking dish. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and transfer to the oven. Bake until the chicken reaches 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 35 minutes.While the chicken bakes, warm the butter in a pan over medium-low heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt. Saute, cooking slowly, until the onions are golden brown and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Stir in the raisins and rum, and use a wooden spoon to loosen any onion bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until the alcohol evaporates, leaving just the rum scented flavor, about 2 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat. When the chicken reaches 150 degrees F, spoon the onion-raisin mixture over the chicken. Raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F, then return chicken to the oven and bake for 10 minutes more, uncovered. The chicken will be fully cooked when it reaches 160 degrees F. Transfer to a serving platter and serve warm or cold.'

S'For the beef: In a large pan with straight sides on medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook, while stirring, until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Leave the bacon fat in the pan and add the olive oil, beef, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper. Brown the beef while breaking it up into bits, about 10 minutes. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a plate and reserve. Leave the fat in the pan for the sauce.For the sauce: Add the butter and flour to the already-hot pan from the beef. If the butter begins to brown, lower the heat while working it into the flour. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes, then raise the heat and slowly whisk in the milk. Once it begins to thicken slightly, add the heavy cream and continue to cook until the sauce reduces a bit more and thickens as well. Add the mustard. The sauce will not be thick like gravy, but not as thin as water either. Taste and season with a pinch of salt.For the casserole: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Using a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish, layer starting at the bottom with: a few spoonfuls of sauce to cover the bottom, half of the ravioli in 1 layer, the Swiss cheese, half of the beef, half of the tomatoes, half of the remaining sauce, the remaining ravioli in 1 layer, the American cheese, the remaining beef, the remaining tomatoes, the remaining sauce and the reserved bacon. Top with all of the shredded cheese blend. Bake until the edges are bubbly and the cheese begins to brown, 30 to 35 minutes.Toss the lettuce and onion in a large bowl with the pickle juice. Serve each portion of casserole with a mound of this garnish over the top.'

S"Preheat the oven to 350degrees F.For the sauce: In a saucepot over medium heat, add the oil, onions and a pinch of salt. Saute until the onions are tender and translucent. Add the tomato paste at this point and turn the heat up a bit, if needed, to cook the paste. Stir and cook until it deepens in color, and then add the cumin, thyme and garlic. Stir to blend and cook until fragrant. Then add the beef broth and crushed tomatoes. Raise the heat to bring the mixture to a boil, and then lower to a simmer and cover, simmering for 20 minutes more. (The sauce can be stored and frozen at this point.)For the beef filling: Meanwhile, in a large pan with straight sides, add the olive oil over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to swirl, add the onions and green and yellow bell peppers. Add the garlic and cook until tender, about 4 minutes more. Add the ground beef, broth, cumin, onion powder, thyme, tomatoes and Spanish seasoning, allowing time between each addition to blend. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of pepper (the Spanish seasoning adds salt content, so be careful to not over season). Stir and break down the beef into bits using a spoon or fork. Cook until the beef is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. (The beef can be stored and frozen at this point.)To assemble the casserole: Toss the shredded cheeses together to blend and set aside. Add 1/2 cup of the red sauce to a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish baking dish and spread to coat the bottom evenly. Top with 6 tortillas, overlapping to cover the bottom of the casserole dish. Layer the dish by next adding half of the beef mixture and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheeses, spreading evenly in the casserole. Next, dunk 6 tortillas, one by one, in the warm red sauce and layer over the cheese and beef, overlapping where needed. Top with the remaining beef, another 1/2 cup of the shredded cheeses and another layer of tortillas dunked in the red sauce. Pour the rest of the sauce over the top, spread evenly and finish with the remaining shredded cheese. Place dish on a baking sheet and bake until the cheese is melted and the sauce bubbles, 25 to 30 minutes. If baking the dish from the freezer, add 15 to 20 minutes to the cook time, or until it\\'s bubbly. Cover loosely with foil if it\\'s browning too quickly. Serve hot."

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Brush both sides of the salmon with 1 teaspoon lemon juice and sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside.  Warm 2 tablespoons oil in 2 separate skillets over medium-high heat. Add half of the onion and half the garlic to each pan. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and thyme into 1 pan and the spinach, lemon zest and remain lemon juice in the other pan. Stir the spinach until it wilts, then transfer it to a bowl and set aside. Saute the mushrooms until they are reduced and tender, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the sour cream. Set aside.  Trim the thinner ends of the salmon fillet so you have 4 pieces of even thickness. Unroll a pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Pass a rolling pin lightly over 2 or 3 times to seal the seams and lengthen slightly. Cut the pastry sheet into 3 equal strips, using the natural seams as a guide. Roll out the second puff pastry sheet to get 1 more strip. Save remaining puff pastry for another use. Lightly prick the 4 strips with a fork. Put 1 heaping spoonful of mushroom mixture on 1 half of each pastry, top with salmon, then layer with a heaping spoonful of spinach mixture. Wet the edges of the pastry with water and fold over the other half, pressing lightly and folding to seal the edges. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling. Cut 2 vents on the top of each pastry packet and arrange them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until the pastry is golden and fish is just opaque in the center, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Transfer the pies from the oven to serving dishes and garnish with chopped parsley.'

S"For the truffle base: In a double boiler (you know the rules, don\\'t let that water touch the bottom of your top pot or bowl), add the milk chocolate, sweetened condensed milk, bittersweet chocolate and salt. Cook until the mixture reduces in volume and slightly thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a tray and then refrigerate until solid, about 3 hours.For the coating. Set the oven to broil or the highest temperature possible on your oven and preheat. On a large parchment paper-lined baking sheet with edges, add the marshmallows in 1 layer. Broil until the marshmallows are black: not brown, but black. If the oven is uneven, rotate the tray during broiling, but it needs to char them black. Have the strength to wait.Allow the marshmallows to cool completely; sliding the parchment off the sheet onto a plate and placing it in the fridge helps. Once the marshmallows are hardened completely, remove and finely chop. Add them to a large bowl with the graham cracker crumbs and stir to combine.Remove the truffle base from the refrigerator and, using a small scoop or spoon, make several balls a bit smaller than a golf ball or the size of a shooter marble. Roll these in the graham/marshmallow coating and place on a tray. Repeat with the rest of the truffle base and coating and refrigerate until ready to serve.Serve the truffles chilled or at room temperature."

S'In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the orange juice with the vinegar, olive oil, garlic, cayenne pepper, oregano, cumin, ancho chili powder, black pepper and 1 teaspoon of the salt to form a paste. Set aside.Wash the pork shoulder and pat the meat dry with a paper towel.Put the shoulder, fat side up, on a cutting board. Leaving the fat in a single piece and attached at 1 end, use a knife to remove the layer of fat from the shoulder, opening it like a book to reveal the meat. Then, use the knife to poke 1-inch deep holes into the meat on all sides. Rub the spice paste around the shoulder, working it into the punctures. Return the fat back to its original position. Score the fat with diagonal cuts and sprinkle the remaining salt over both sides of fat. Wrap the shoulder tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 8 hours or overnight.Remove the pork from the refrigerator 1 hour before you start cooking.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Pour the remaining orange juice into a roasting pan. Unwrap the pork from the plastic and put it in the pan, fat side up. Roast, uncovered, for 30 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Roast for 3 hours and 45 minutes longer. If the orange juice dries up during the cooking process, add in more juice or water. Serve when the internal temperature of the pork reaches 185 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. The meat should pull away with the prick of a fork and the skin is crispy. Remove the meat from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for 20 minutes, under a tent of aluminum foil, before serving. Slice the meat, arrange it on a serving platter and serve.'

S"For the Cajun clams: In a bowl, add the milk, seafood seasoning, lemon zest, a nice pinch of salt and a few good grinds of pepper. Whisk until the salt dissolves. Add the clams, and then soak in the refrigerator for 2 hours.For the dredge mixture: In a brown paper bag or bowl, add the cornmeal, flour, seafood seasoning, a nice pinch of salt and a few good grinds of pepper. Stir to combine. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the clams from the bowl, shaking off any excess milk. Drop them into the flour mixture and shake or stir to coat. Place the clams on a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack and rest 15 minutes.In a heavy-bottomed pot, add enough oil to reach 4 inches up the sides. Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 365 degrees F. Fry the clams in batches until golden brown, about 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on the size of the clams. Remove from the oil to a paper-towel-lined plate and season lightly with salt.Serve with a spritz of lemon juice, cocktail sauce and tartar sauce, but I\\'m having it with a side of burger."

Once the sugar and salt have dissolved, remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Transfer to a large bowl, add the chicken, and refrigerate, covered, at least 2 hours or overnight.   Bring the remaining 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. In a medium heatproof bowl, add the ancho chiles and cover with the boiling water. Weigh down with a plate so the peppers remain under water and let them soak for 15 minutes. Remove and discard the stems when the peppers have softened.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.   On a sheet tray toss the jalapenos, onion, tomatoes, garlic and cumin with 2 tablespoons oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Roast until nicely caramelized with good color, 25 to 30 minutes. Add the pumpkin seeds to a dry, hot skillet on high heat. Stir often, until the seeds are golden and begin to pop. Transfer to a food processor along with roasted vegetables. Add the soaked chiles, about 2 tablespoons of chili soaking liquid, the cilantro leaves and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the processor. Puree until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if needed.Remove the chicken from the refrigerator, blot dry with paper towels and put into a large Dutch oven. Pour in the mole sauce and bake, covered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer the chicken to a cutting board to cool. When cool to the touch, shred the chicken and add it back to the sauce. Spoon the mole into corn tortillas and serve with lime wedges, avocado slices, shredded lettuce, red onion, and radishes.

Let sit to drain until you have about 2 cups of juice. Do not squeeze the apple mixture in the cheesecloth to extract more juice. Pour the stained juice into the saucepan and stir in the sugar. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer and cook until reduced by half and becomes thick. Reserve half the jelly for serving and half for brushing on the chops as they grill. Let jelly cool slightly before brushing the chops.Preheat grill to medium-high heat.Season lamb chops with salt and pepper and lightly coat with oil. Grill on each side for about 3 minutes, for medium rare, continuously brushing with the glaze. Mix the remaining 1/4 cup of chopped mint into reserved jelly and serve alongside grilled chops.'

Add the 1/4 cup dill, the garlic, a nice pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Bring to a boil and simmer until the pot is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and remove the pot from the heat. Stir, allowing the shrimp to cook until pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the pot in a colander and pour the shrimp into the ice bath to cool.To make the salad: In a large bowl, combine the dill, grated garlic, mayonnaise, sour cream, yogurt, cucumber, onion, lemon zest, and sugar. Taste, and then season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Remove the shrimp from the ice bath, dry gently with a paper towel, and coarsely chop. Stir them into the dressing until combined.Tear the first few layers from the center of each iceberg wedge (creating a "bowl" in the wedge) and put them on individual salad plates. Divide the shrimp salad among each plate, filling the lettuce "bowl" and letting the salad spill over onto the wedge. Garnish with chopped dill. Serve cold or at room temperature.'

S'In a large stockpot over medium-high heat, melt 1/4 cup butter and lightly saute the onions and garlic, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken, water, and stock, making sure liquid covers meat. Tie the thyme sprigs, parsley stems, and sage sprigs together and add to the pot along with the peppercorns, and celery. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the chicken until it is "fall of the bone" tender, about 30 minutes, skimming off scum as it simmers. Remove the chicken from the pot to a cutting board and let cool. Remove the herb bundle and the celery and discard. Reserve the stock. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pull it from bones and cut into bite-sized pieces.In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups of flour with the remaining chopped herbs and the tablespoon of salt. Make a well in the middle and pour 1 cup of the reserved chicken stock, including fat, into the well. Using a fork, slowly stir the stock into the flour. Repeat, adding more flour and/or stock until a soft, doughy consistency is reached. Add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if it gets too sticky. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 to 1/4-inch thickness. Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to slice the dough into 2-inch squares, then cut the squares in half on the diagonal into triangles.Return the stock to a simmer and slowly add the dumplings, allowing some excess flour to remain on the dumplings to increase the body of the broth. Be careful not to let the dumplings touch as they are added to the pot. Cook until the dumplings rise to the surface. If the broth does not thicken to your liking, mix together 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon flour in a small bowl with a fork. Slowly add the mixture into the broth to help thicken the soup. Stir in the reserved chicken and ladle into serving bowls.'

When the oil heats and the bacon begins to sizzle, add the sweet potatoes and spread out as much as possible to allow the potatoes to rest in the pan in 1 layer. Leave the potatoes to cook until a quick toss reveals browning on the side in contact with the pan, about 5 minutes. Continue to toss and let stand until most sides of the potatoes are golden and the bacon bits are crisp, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Then add the onions, garlic, jalapenos, cumin and season with a nice pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of pepper. Cook the same way, allowing everything to sit in the heat of the pan for a minute or 2.

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.For the chips: In a large frying pan pour enough oil to fill it 1-inch deep, and heat it to 360 degrees F. When the oil begins to swirl add the tortilla wedges in batches and fry, flipping once until golden and a light tap sounds hollow, about 4 minutes total. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle each batch with a pinch of salt as they are placed on the plate. Transfer evenly to serving plates or a platter.Meanwhile make the jalapeno salsa: On a baking sheet toss the jalapeno halves, onion, and garlic with olive oil and arrange so that garlic cloves hide under the cavities of the jalapeno halves. Season with salt and pepper, and roast in the oven until the jalapenos begin to blacken and char along with the onions, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and place all the ingredients, oil included, into a food processor. Add the cilantro, chicken stock, and lime juice, blend until smooth, taste and season with salt. Set aside.For the cheese sauce: In a small saucepan on medium heat, add the butter, oil, onion, pinch salt and couple grinds pepper. Saute until the onions are tender, then add the flour and cook until it stops foaming, but does not brown, about 2 minutes. Add the heavy cream and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the cheese and stir until melted. Keep warm.To assemble the nachos, layer the chips on a platter and scatter with the shredded chicken, drizzle cheese sauce, and finish by topping with some of the jalapeno salsa.'

S'Preheat grill to medium.Soak skewers in water while preparing the BBQ sauce. In a medium saucepan melt butter and saute onions and jalapeno, until tender. Season with cayenne, and salt and pepper. Add ginger, brown sugar, orange juice and ketchup in that order making sure to blend each ingredient completely before adding the next ingredient. Let simmer until the edges begin to caramelize, about 15 minutes. Set aside and let cool. Once cool, remove half of the sauce and reserve for dipping. The other half is for brushing on the shrimp when grilling. Cut bacon in thirds. Thread each shrimp onto a skewer, starting from the tail end. Bend the shrimp as you thread it so it lies in 1 straight line on the skewer, removing its natural curve. Wrap the center of each shrimp with a piece of bacon. Brush with BBQ sauce and place skewers with bacon, seam side down, onto the grill. Cook over medium heat until bacon crisps and shrimp is cooked through, about 8 minutes.'

S'For the ravioli, in a medium bowl, combine the shredded cooked beef (or fresh chuck), cheese, garlic, onion pulp, oregano, and salt. Using both hands, mix and squeeze the beef and seasonings together.To make the ravioli, lay a few wonton wrappers, flour side up, on a work surface and set a glass of water next to it.  Scoop a spoonful of the beef filling (about 2 tablespoons) into the center of each wrapper. Wet your finger and lightly trace the border of each wonton. Fold the wrapper in half, pressing out any air, and seal the edges with your fingers. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.  Cover the ravioli with a towel while you prepare the sauce.To make the sauce, in a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, tomato sauce, onions, and vodka. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Reduce the heat, stir in the heavy cream and cheese, bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes more. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm while you cook the ravioli.To cook the ravioli, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches, gently drop the ravioli, one at a time, into the water. Cook until the ravioli float. (If using fresh ground chuck, cook for about 6 minutes until the meat is cooked through, testing one ravioli by cutting in half.)Transfer the hot ravioli to a serving platter and top with warm vodka sauce, or gently place them directly in the sauce, toss to coat, and divide among serving plates.'

S'To roast the tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Season the tomatoes with oregano, salt and pepper, to taste. Drizzle with oil and arrange them on a cooling rack over a baking sheet. Roast until then are golden, 20 to 25 minutes.Raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F when the tomatoes are roasted. Unfold 1 puff pastry sheet onto a clean cutting board. Prick the dough evenly, multiple times, with a fork. Using a 2-inch pastry cutter, cut out 12 circles and arrange them on a parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with the second sheet of pastry. Bake until they are nicely puffed and golden, about 8 minutes.To assemble: Cut the puffs in half. Spoon a generous teaspoon of marinara sauce into the bottom of half of the puffs and sprinkle with Parmesan. Put a roasted tomato on top of each followed by the basil and a sprinkling of the mozzarella. Top with the other puff pastry halves and arrange them on a baking sheet. Bake for another 5 minutes, giving the cheese time to melt. Transfer the bites to a serving platter and serve warm.'

S'Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. In a large bowl sift to combine the flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons of the sugar and salt. In small bowl whisk the egg yolks until smooth, then add the milk, vegetable oil, lemon extract, and lemon zest. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the liquid ingredients and gently stir the batter, with a wooden spoon, until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. You can use a hand beater or a stand mixer on low speed, if desired. In a very clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy. Add the remaining sugar and beat until soft peaks form. Gently fold the whites into the batter. Pour about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup batter into an oiled waffle iron, sprinkle with walnuts, then close the iron. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes, depending on waffle iron settings. Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm in a low oven. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm with maple syrup.'

Refrigerate until ready to use.For the bologna: In a large pan on medium-high heat add the oil. Add the bologna chunks to the hot oil. Saute while tossing to brown all sides, about 8 minutes. Add the onions and season lightly with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Continue to toss while cooking until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the mustard, and honey to coat, and then add the wine. Simmer while tossing until the wine bubbles and foams and is reduced to only a bit of sauce in the pan.To assemble the sandwiches, slather chipotle mayonnaise on each slice of toasted bread and top equally with the bologna. To serve as a smaller bite, cut the toasted bread into 1/4ths and continue to top as directed.'

S'Position a rack in the middle of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until crumbly. Slowly drizzle in the butter while pulsing until the crumbs are moist but still crumbly. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the side of an 8-inch springform pan using the bottom of a measuring cup, making sure the crust goes at least 1 inch up the side. Set aside.Whisk together the egg yolks, condensed milk, lime and orange zests and juices in a medium bowl. Pour into the crust and bake until the pie sets, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the broiler. Whisk the egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until foamy. Slowly add the sugar until the meringue turns glossy. Increase the speed and continue whisking until the meringue holds medium-soft peaks and is glossy but not dry. Top the pie decoratively with the meringue. Broil in the middle of the oven until the meringue begins browning on top, about 3 minutes. Serve warm or let cool to room temperature.

S'Make the sauce: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the tomatillos, onion, jalapeno and olive oil on a baking sheet and season with salt and black pepper. Roast until browned, about 45 minutes. Puree in a blender with the cilantro, thinning with water as needed. Season with salt.Meanwhile, prepare the omelet: Cook the chorizo in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, breaking it up, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Stir the cumin, cayenne and paprika into the drippings in the skillet. Add the beans and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper, then add the bell pepper and cook 1 to 2 more minutes. Transfer to a bowl.Whisk the eggs and milk in another bowl. Wipe out the skillet, reduce the heat to medium and add 1/2 tablespoon butter. Pour half of the egg mixture into the skillet and cook until the center is no longer liquid, loosening the edges with a rubber spatula and tilting the skillet to let the uncooked egg run underneath. Shake the pan to loosen the omelet, then spoon half of the bean mixture, chorizo and cheese down the center. Fold in both sides to cover the filling, then flip the omelet so it is seam-side down and cook 1 more minute. Repeat with the remaining butter, egg mixture and fillings to make another omelet. Top with the tomatillo sauce and garnish with the crema and tomato.Photograph by Stephanie Foley'

Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry, reserving marinade. Season chicken with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, sear chicken on all sides in 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat until golden brown. Remove to a plate. In the same pot add more oil, if needed, and saute the onions, carrot and celery until tender. Add cayenne pepper and tomato paste and cook until tomatoes turn a deep reddish brown color. Add flour and stir until incorporated then pour in reserved marinade. Stir and simmer until thickened about 10 minutes. Add chicken back to the pot and pour in enough stock to just come up the sides of the chicken but not cover it completely. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook covered for about 1 hour or until the chicken falls off the bone. Gently remove legs from pot and strain liquid from the solids, discarding the solids. Return chicken and strained liquid back to the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer. Heat a large saute pan with remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat and add bacon. Cook until crispy then add mushrooms and pearl onions. Continue to cook until tender and browned. Add mixture back to the pot with the chicken. Toss the noodles with butter. Place the noodles on a serving platter or individual plates and top with the chicken.

Stirring constantly, cook until the shallots and peppers soak up the wine and the wine evaporates, about 5 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Add the cream, mustard and lemon zest. Increase the heat slightly, and continue to cook and stir until the liquid slightly reduces and thickens, about 8 more minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley.For the fingerlings and mushrooms: Place a large baking sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.In a large pot, add the potatoes, a nice pinch of salt and cover with an inch of water. Bring to a boil and boil the potatoes for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the potatoes to sit for 5 more minutes. Drain and air-dry the potatoes.Remove the baking sheet from the oven and quickly scatter half of the rosemary and thyme on it. Arrange the potatoes and mushrooms over the herbs. Spritz the entire baking sheet with the lemon juice and drizzle everything lightly with the olive oil. Place the remaining herbs over the top. Roast until the potatoes are tender and the mushrooms are darker in color and tender, 30 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway through.Remove the herbs and serve warm, at room temperature or chilled, with a drizzle of the sauce, served at the same temperature as the dish.'

Cook until the vegetables are tender and the onions become translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and stir.Add the sausage and beef in parts around the pan. Cook while breaking up with a wooden spoon until both are cooked through and browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stir. Add enough stock to cover the contents by almost an inch. Bring the pan to a boil then add the broken lasagna sheets. Nudge and nestle them beneath the level of liquid. Cover the pot, lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the lasagna noodles are al dente, 6 to 8 minutes.In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta and the lemon zest. Evenly scoop the pan-sagna into shallow serving bowls. Immediately top each with some shredded cheese, a dollop of the ricotta blend, and garnish with some basil and parsley.'

S"For the roasted garlic: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.In a ramekin, add the olive oil and garlic. Roast until the oil begins to bubble and the garlic becomes a very light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the garlic to a large bowl and put half of the oil in a large pan. Reserve the rest of the oil in the ramekin for garnishing.For the dip: In the large pan with the garlic-infused oil, add the eggplant, onion and paprika; you may have to do this in batches. Turn to medium-high heat and cook, tossing, until all sides of the eggplant are lightly golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer everything in the pan, bits and all, to the large bowl with the awaiting garlic.Using a mezzaluna, chop the contents of the bowl until broken down but still a bit chunky. Sure you can do this in a food processor, but it may lose the texture if over-pulsed. You can also chop all of this on a cutting board, then scrape everything back into the large bowl. Add the parsley, yogurt and lemon zest and juice to the bowl. Stir to combine, taste and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until cool.If traveling with this to a swanky party, wait to garnish until just before serving at your host\\'s place. Transfer the dip into a serving bowl, make a nice swirl with the back of a spoon and pour over the remaining garlic-infused olive oil. Sprinkle over the chopped parsley and serve with assorted pita chips, grissini and flatbread crisps."

S"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.For the spicy ketchup sauce: Add the ketchup, vinegar and hot chili sauce to a bowl and stir. Reserve 1/2 cup for the meatloaf.For the meatloaf: In a large bowl, whisk together the Worcestershire sauce, egg, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic, thyme, onions, scallions and reserved spicy ketchup sauce. Crumble half the chuck into the bowl, followed by some bread, then half the turkey pile on some more bread cubes. Repeat with the other half of meat and remaining bread. (So a half pound of crumbled chuck, some bread, then a half pound of ground turkey, some bread and repeat until done. Adding this way will make mixing easier and lighter for a juicier loaf.) Gently mix with 1 hand, bringing the egg mixture from the bottom to the top and around until everything is gently combined. Place into a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, flatten the top and pour the remaining spicy ketchup sauce over the top evenly. Bake in the oven for 60 minutes. Remove and allow to rest for 10 minutes.Tilt the loaf pan slowly to 1 corner and discard any excess fat or juices from the pan while holding the loaf inside. Don\\'t worry, the meatloaf will still be juicy! Slice into 1-inch thick portions. Serve warm and if there\\'s anything left, refrigerate it and enjoy a meatloaf sandwich for leftovers the next day."

S'For the casserole: Preheat the oven to 375degrees F. Butter a 13- by 9-inch ovenproof dish or lasagna dish and set aside.Cook the egg noodles in salted boiling water according to package directions for al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and immediately place the noodles in a large bowl filled with ice water to stop the cooking. Once cooled, drain and then pour the pasta into a large bowl with the tuna, peas and both cheeses. Toss to combine.In a large pan with straight sides, add the 2 tablespoons butter, the olive oil, onions and thyme. Season with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and cook on medium heat until the onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and cook gently until tender and darkened, about 5 minutes more. Add the Worcestershire sauce and horseradish, and then sprinkle the flour over the entire pan. Stir to help the flour soak into the vegetables and cook a minute more to lose the flour taste. Raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken stock. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes, and then slowly stir in the heavy cream. Simmer until the cream is thickened slightly, about 4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt if needed. Pour the mushroom sauce over the prepared noodles in the large bowl and quickly stir to combine. Immediately pour into the prepared dish.For the topping: In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and olive oil. Season with a sprinkle of salt and a grind or two of pepper. Stir until the crumbs soak up the oil evenly. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the top of the dish and place, uncovered, in the oven until the sides are bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let it rest 5 minutes before serving.'

S'For the squash: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Place the squash on a baking sheet flesh-side up and rub with the olive oil. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Roast until the edges begin to ripple and a poke with a fork reveals tender flesh, about 40 minutes. Allow to cool until easy to handle.Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh into a large bowl, leaving about 1/4 inch of flesh within the skin of each squash half to help it maintain its shape.For the filling: In a large pan on medium-high heat, add the olive oil and sausage. While cooking, break the sausage into bits like ground meat with a wooden spoon. Once some of the fat is rendered from the sausage, add the onions, paprika, pumpkin pie spice, sage, celery, bell peppers and a pinch of salt. Cook until the sausage is done and the vegetables are tender.Add the mixture to the bowl of squash along with the cheese, walnuts and cranberries and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Fill the hollowed squash halves with the mixture and place back in the oven to melt the cheese and make the tops golden brown, 15 more minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve warm.'

S"Make the dip: Blend the heavy cream in a blender until slightly thickened. Add the sour cream, lemon juice, blue cheese, scallions and garlic powder and pulse to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill 2 hours. Make the chips: Heat 1 to 2 inches vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Rest a cooling rack on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Spread some flour in a baking dish, add the beet slices and toss. Tap off the excess flour, then fry the beets in batches (don\\'t overcrowd the pot), stirring occasionally to make sure they don\\'t stick to each other, 3 to 5 minutes, or until the fizzling around the chips slows down.Transfer the chips with a slotted spoon to the rack and season with salt. Let cool at least 5 minutes; the chips will crisp up as they cool. Return the oil to 350 degrees F between batches.Replenish the oil, if necessary, and return to 350 degrees F. Dredge the sweet potato slices in flour and fry in batches, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the rack, season with salt and let cool. Serve the chips with the blue-cheese dip.Photograph by Steve Giralt"

S"Slice the bacon into 1/2-inch chunks. Add to a large soup pot and cook over medium-high heat to render the fat and get crispy on all sides, about 8 minutes total. The more brown the better; just don\\'t burn them. They are perfect when they are more chewy than juicy. Remove bacon chunks and set aside on a paper towel lined plate. Pour off all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of fat from the stock pot. Add the onion, carrot and celery with a pinch of salt and pepper and saute until onions are just translucent, about 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cumin and let cook another minute before adding the split peas and stock. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the peas are al dente (cooked through, but slightly firm and whole), about 20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes.Ladle out about 3 cups of the peas and carefully blitz the remaining soup using an immersion blender or countertop blender until creamy. If using a countertop blender be sure to only fill it about 1/3 the way up and start on a slow speed, then raise to a higher speed. This method will take a bit longer due to the need to blitz in batches. Pour the soup back into the pot. Return the 3 cups of peas to the soup and stir to combine and heat through. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top with bacon, tomato and a squeeze of lime."

S'For the cauliflower: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Trim the green leaves from the base of each head of cauliflower. Then trim a sliver off of each base to level it. Make 2 equal slices vertically from the top to the base of each head of cauliflower, creating 4 steaks in total.In a large baking dish, add the beer, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, red chile flakes, garlic, a nice pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Whisk until the sugar and salt dissolve, then place the steaks in 1 layer in the dish.Bake the steaks, flipping them once, until tender but still firm enough to hold their shape, about 20 minutes. Use your judgment when you flip them to determine if they need to cook the full 20 minutes.Transfer the cauliflower steaks to a paper towel-lined baking sheet; reserve the baking liquid for the next step. Pat the top of each steak dry as well.For the glaze: In a medium bowl, add the jam, jerk seasoning, lime juice and 1/4 cup of the cauliflower baking liquid. Stir to loosen and combine.Heat a cast-iron griddle to medium-high heat (cast iron is preferred, but you can use a large pan and do this in batches, or use a nonstick griddle, but cast iron--ooooh--cast iron!!!).Drizzle each cauliflower steak with olive oil on both sides followed by a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Place the steaks on the griddle and cook until lightly golden brown when you take a peek beneath, 4 to 6 minutes; gently flip the steaks, then allow them to become golden brown again on the other side. Brush the tops and sides of each liberally with the glaze. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, then remove to a platter and sprinkle with the mint and cilantro. Serve warm.Chop the chilled leftovers for a quick salad.'

S'Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a small bowl, drizzle the tomatoes with oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and put a cooling rack on top. Arrange the tomato slices on the rack. Roast until the tomatoes begin to caramelize on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove and let cool, then gently chop.Pile the cilantro, onion, lime zest and a pinch of salt together on a cutting board. Chop vigorously until finely minced and combined. Mix in the chopped tomatoes.On a griddle or a saute pan large enough to fit the sandwiches, add half of the butter on medium- high heat. Build the sandwiches directly on the grill by putting 1 slice of bread on the pan, making sure the bread gets moistened with the butter. Top with a slice of cheese, evenly sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the onion-tomato mixture, a second slice of cheese and then top with another piece of bread. Repeat for the rest of the sandwiches, gently pressing down each sandwich with a spatula. After the cheese begins to melt a bit, check the bottom of the sandwich for color and if golden brown, gently flip. Add the other half of the butter around the edges and gently press each sandwich while toasting the second side. Remove when the bottom reveals a golden brown color and the cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. Arrange on serving plates and serve.'

Pour tofu into a mixing bowl, add remaining filling ingredients and use hands to mix well. Fill a small bowl with water. Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of filling in the center of a dumpling wrapper. Wet the outer edge and fold to make a half-circle. Pinch dough together to seal, pushing air out as you work. Repeat process until the remaining dumplings are all assembled. In batches, deep-fry dumplings until golden, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.

S'Drain the oysters and place in a small bowl. Cover with 1 cup milk and let soak for 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together remaining milk, water, cayenne and eggs. Place the flour, cornmeal, black pepper, and salt into a brown paper bag, close and shake to mix.In a large heavy-bottomed pot, pour enough oil to fill the pan halfway. Heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 360 degrees F.Drain the oysters from the milk. In batches dip oysters in the egg mixture then drop in the paper bag. Close and shake. Remove to a plate and repeat with the rest of the oysters. When oil is at 360 degrees F, fry oysters in batches. Do not overcrowd. Cook turning once until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove to a paper towel. Repeat with remaining oysters.To serve, cut sandwich loaves in half horizontally. Slather a generous amount of Spicy Remoulade Sauce on the inside. Place a lettuce leaf inside and fill generously with oysters. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over oysters just before serving.'

S'Prepare the pork: Combine the mustard, honey, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, the paprika and garlic in a bowl. Prick the pork on all sides (including the fat) with a paring knife, about 1/2 inch deep. Brush all over with the mustard mixture. Tightly wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 6 hours. Unwrap the pork, place in a roasting pan and bring to room temperature. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Transfer the pork to the oven and pour 1 inch hot water into the pan. Cook 3 hours, adding water as needed to maintain 1 inch. Remove the pan from the oven, add water if needed and cover tightly with foil. Return to the oven and cook 6 more hours. Turn off the oven and let the pork rest inside, about 1 hour.Meanwhile, make the sauce: Melt the butter with the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and paprika and cook 2 to 3 more minutes (reduce the heat if the garlic starts to brown). Stir in the brown sugar, preserves, ketchup and chili sauce, stirring after each addition. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the vinegar. Add salt to taste. Remove the pork from the oven and take the meat off the bone. Coarsely shred the meat using 2 carving forks. Toss with some of the barbecue sauce and pan juices and season with salt and pepper. Serve on rolls with coleslaw.Photograph by Steve Giralt'

Strain the oysters over the pot of stock and set aside the oysters.In a large bowl, mix all the stuffing cubes with the parsley and set aside.In a saute pan on medium heat, add 2 tablespoons butter, celery, onions, sage, thyme and garlic. Season with a pinch of salt and a nice grind of pepper. Cook until the onions and celery are tender, but the garlic is not browned. Remove to the bowl of bread cubes. In the same pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the oysters. Saute until the edges begin to curl on the oysters. Remove to the bowl of stuffing cubes and stir to combine with everything. Pour the stock over the mixture and stir. This is a wet dressing, so it will be very moist. Pour into a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Press down to make it compact, and then cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 45 minutes, then raise the temperature to 400 degrees F and bake uncovered until golden brown on top, about 15 minutes more.'

S'For the steak: To a large resealable bag, add the red wine vinegar, hot sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and lime zest and juice. Mix together and add the flank steak. Marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator.Preheat the grill to medium-high.Remove the steak from the marinade and discard the marinade. Pat the steak dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill over medium-high heat until cooked to medium-rare,5 to 6 minutes per side. Let rest 10 minutes, loosely covered with aluminum foil, before slicing.For the gravy: In a large pan with straight sides, add the butter, olive oil, onions and thyme. Season with salt and pepper and cook over medium heat until the onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic, season with salt and cook gently until the mushrooms are tender and darkened, about 5 minutes more. Add the Worcestershire sauce and horseradish. Sprinkle the flour over the entire pan. Stir to help the flour to soak into the vegetables and cook a minute more to lose the flour flavor. Raise the heat to medium-high and add the beef stock. Cook until slightly thickened, then slowly stir in the heavy cream. Simmer until the cream is thickened slightly, about 4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt, if needed.For the toast: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F or a grill to medium heat.Arrange the sliced bread on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. In a small pot, add the butter, onion powder, thyme and garlic and season with salt. Heat over medium-low heat until the butter is melted. Brush the garlic butter evenly onto the bread. If baking, place in the oven and bake until the edges are golden, about 10 minutes. If grilling, place the bread slices buttered-side down on the grill and grill until toasted and grill marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes.To serve, layer the toast, then slices of beef and pour over a spoonful of gravy.'

S"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.To make the glaze, add the apple cider, brown sugar, bourbon, pumpkin pie spice and cloves to a large pot. Turn the heat to medium high and cook, while stirring, until the liquid reduces and becomes slightly thickened like a glaze, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the butter and stir to melt. Taste and season with salt and pepper.Lay out plenty of aluminum foil to wrap the ham in and create a bed for it. Place the ham in the center of the aluminum foil and pull the sides up around it, leaving the top exposed. Pour over half the glaze, getting it into the spirals. Finish tightly wrapping the ham and place it on a rack in a roasting pan. Fill the pan with water, but do not let it touch the bottom of the ham.Cook until the internal temperature reaches about 140 degrees F (gauge 15 to 20 minutes per pound). Remember, it is already cooked, so you just need to bring it to temperature without drying it out.Remove the ham and raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Pull back the aluminum foil (watch out--it\\'s steamy and hot!!). With a brush and the remaining glaze, slather the top of the ham, allowing the glaze to get into any creases of the spiral you see. Place back in the oven uncovered but still sitting in the foil and roasting pan, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and rest 10 minutes before serving."

Add coconut milk and fill saucepan with enough water to cover the rice by 1/2-inch or measure by placing your thumb tip on the rice and filling the pot with water until the water reaches the middle of your thumbnail. Bring rice to a simmer, cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid has evaporated, about 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from heat and let rice stand another 5 minutes, covered.

S'Special Equipment: Food ProcessorIn a large cast iron skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Discard bacon fat in the pan. In a food processor fitted with the grater attachment, push potato, onion and garlic through the grater. Remove mixture to a towel and squeeze out excess liquid. Place potato mixture in a large bowl and mix in sage, eggs, flour, cooked bacon and salt and pepper, to taste. Fill the skillet with 1/4-inch of vegetable oil and heat until it ripples. Once the oil is preheated, form potato cakes, measuring roughly 3 inches in diameter, and add to the pan. Continue forming patties, working in batches. Cook pancakes until crispy and nicely browned, pressing down on the pancakes periodically to flatten, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Keep cooked pancakes warm in a preheated 275 degree F oven while remaining pancakes cook.'

S"1. Prepare the potatoes. Soak the potato slices covered by ice-cold water in a large bowl for 30 minutes, stirring a bit. Then transfer the potatoes to a colander and rinse until the water runs clear. Pour the potato slices onto a clean kitchen towel or several layered paper towels and dry as much as possible.2. Fry the potatoes. In a large pan with straight sides or a stock pot on medium-high heat, add enough oil to fill to 1 inch deep. In batches, fry the potato slices, flipping halfway through until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes on each side. They should be stiff and crispy on the outside, but maintain a fleshy inside. Taste one, cook\\'s treat! Remove each batch to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season with a sprinkle of salt.3. Prepare the pico de gallo. In a small bowl toss the tomatoes with the scallions, hot sauce, lime juice, cumin, cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside.4. Bake the potatoes. Preheat the oven to 375F. Butter the bottom of a pie pan or an 8x8-inch baking pan. Using half the potatoes, layer the slices in a circular pattern beginning on the outside of the pan and moving towards the center, with the slices slightly overlapping. Make sure to cover the entire bottom this way. Then evenly sprinkle half the cheddar/jack blend over the potato layer. On top of that sprinkle the pico de gallo, then add an even sprinkle of half the mozzarella. Repeat the layer one more time ending with the mozzarella cheese. Place in the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and golden on the edges, about 18 minutes. Cut into slices and serve warm with a dollop of Mexican crema."

S"In a large nonstick pan with sloped sides (even a wok shape works), melt the butter over medium-low heat, being careful to not brown the butter. If it begins to bubble, the heat is too high, so lower the heat to cook the eggs properly. (Slow and low like BBQ is the way to go with eggs.)Meanwhile, in a large bowl, add the eggs and 1 teaspoon cold water. Vigorously whisk until frothy and smooth. Swirl the pan around to coat the butter on the bottom and up the sides. Pour the eggs into the pan and let sit for a few seconds. When the eggs begin to lightly set on the bottom, use the whisk to gently beat the eggs, then allow them to sit for just a few seconds between beating them again. Curds will begin to form and increase throughout the cooking time. Repeat this process of whisking then resting the eggs for a few seconds until about 50 percent of the eggs are set and the rest are still wet. At this point, sprinkle the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper and continue to whisk and rest alternately. Once the eggs are 75 percent done, add the cheese and from this moment, continue to whisk the eggs until done. This entire process from pouring in the eggs to them being finished should take 8 to 12 minutes; this isn\\'t a race, only a journey to the best scrambled eggs ever. Remove from the heat and continue to scramble in the last seconds. Serve warm.Cook\\'s Note: While scrambling, if a thin film of egg begins to set on the edges of the pan while you are whisking away, the heat is too high and you are whisking a bit too fast. Be gentle and take your time. If this happens, very quickly before it browns, incorporate those dry edges back into the eggs with a twist of the whisk and they\\'ll disappear."

In a Dutch oven or roasting pan place 3 of the onion rings in a circle to form a trivet for the brisket (if using a roasting pan place all onion rings out in a single layer). Place the garlic in the spaces not occupied by the rings, then add one slab of brisket making sure to place it evenly on top of the rings. Add another layer of onion rings then the second slab of brisket (if using roasting pan, place brisket side by side in single layer on top of onons). Pour over the remaining marinade, the broth and wine in equal parts until the meat is just covered. Cover and cook for 3 hours adding the carrots and celery 30 minutes before the end of cooking. Check the brisket a few times while cooking and add salt, as needed, and broth and wine in equal parts if the level of the liquid falls below the meat.

Pour into the sieve and allow the juice to slowly drip into the bowl without forcing any of the pulp through. Discard solids. This should yield about 12 ounces of juice.In a pitcher, combine the watermelon and cucumber juice with the lime juice and tequila. Fill 4 highball glasses with ice and evenly divide juice among glasses. Top off each glass with seltzer water. Serve the glasses topped with a couple of cucumber and lime slices.'

Strain the oil and remove the thyme to a paper towel-lined plate. Discard the rosemary and garlic, but reserve the oil.Brush one side of each piece of bread with the oil and place them oiled-side up on a wire rack fitted inside a baking sheet with sides. On another wire rack place the strips of speck ham and brush the top of each with maple syrup. Bake in the oven until both the toast and ham are golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.Meanwhile make the eggs. In a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat, add a few tablespoons of the reserved olive oil. Crack each egg over the pan and allow to fry until most of the whites are cooked, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and a grind or two of pepper, then lower the heat and cover until the top of the eggs are cooked, but the yolks are not, about 2 minutes more.To assemble the sandwiches: Spread a tablespoon of grape jelly on the oiled side of each piece of bread. Top with a few strips of folded over ham, an egg and a few sprigs of the reserved fried thyme. Garnish with the shredded Parmesan cheese.'

When the oil begins to swirl, add the beef, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook until the meat is browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and saute for a few minutes to intensify the flavor. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Season again and remove the mixture to a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan.In the same pan, add the onions and cook until almost tender. Then add the carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, tossing, until the vegetables are tender but still a bit crunchy, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat.In the bottom of a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish in this order, layer half of the beef mixture, pressing it down to level it, and then sprinkle half of the cheese evenly over the beef. Pour the remaining half of the beef over the cheese and press down to level as well. Add the vegetables, followed by the remaining cheese; press to level. Top with the tater tots in a neat row like little soldiers. Sprinkle the top with paprika and bake until the edges on the tots turn golden brown, 25 minutes.'

S'Potstickers: In a food processor, add the shrimp, garlic, scallions, soy sauce and egg. Pulse until combined but still chunky. Remove the mixture to a bowl. To assemble the potstickers, put about 1 teaspoon of filling into the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten the rim of the wrapper with water. Fold the dough until the ends meet and press the air out of the center towards the edges. Seal by pressing firmly. This is the simplest way.To make the classic pleated look: using your thumb and index finger, pinch the corner of the unsealed wonton closed. Using your other hand pull a bit of the unsealed wonton edge toward the pinched corner and pinch to make a slight pleat in the wrapper, continue to pull the loose wrapper in and pleating until you run out of space, then push the air out through the final opening and pinch together. Repeat for the rest of the wontons. You can freeze them at this point on a baking sheet first, and then transfer to a freezer bag.Dipping sauce: Stir all the ingredients together in a small serving bowl.When ready to cook the potstickers, add oil to a large saute pan. When oil begins to swirl, add potstickers to the pan and cook until golden brown on 1 side. Flip and add 3 ice cubes. Immediately cover the pan to let the potstickers steam and cook through, about 3 minutes. Remove to a large platter and serve with dipping sauce.'

S'Make the enchilada sauce: In a medium pot over medium heat, combine the oil, onion, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook until the onion is tender, about 6 minutes. Raise the heat to medium high and add the tomato paste; stir with a wooden spoon and cook until it deepens in color, 3 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin and thyme. Cook, stirring, until combined and fragrant, about 1 minute, then add the crushed tomatoes and beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, for 20 minutes. Cover and keep warm over low heat.Cook the beef: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large straight-sided pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and green and red bell peppers. Sprinkle with a nice pinch of salt and cook until the onion and peppers are tender but not browned, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. In this order, add the beef, onion powder, cumin, thyme, Sazon, tomatoes and broth, allowing time between each addition to stir and blend. Cook for another 8 to 10 minutes, stirring to break down the beef into bits. When the beef is cooked through, taste and season with a pinch of salt and a grind or two of pepper. (Sazon adds salt, so be careful not to over-season.) Set aside.Prepare the chicken layer: In a large bowl, toss together the shredded chicken, 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce and the cheddar and pepper jack cheeses. Set aside.Assemble and bake the casserole: Use the butter to coat the bottom and sides of a deep 13-by-9-inch baking dish. In a small bowl, toss the shredded cheeses together. Pour 1 cup of enchilada sauce into the prepared dish. One at a time, dunk the tortilla slices in the still-warm enchilada sauce in the pot and layer them on the bottom of the dish using the straight edges to line the sides, overlapping where needed and covering the entire bottom of the dish. Next, add 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese blend, all of the beef, another 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese blend, a new layer of tortillas dunked in the enchilada sauce, all of the chicken and a final layer of tortillas dunked in the enchilada sauce. Pour the rest of the sauce over all of the layers and top with the remaining shredded cheese blend. Bake until the cheese is melted and the sauce bubbles, about 30 minutes. Let it rest a bit before you slice it, just like lasagna.Photograph by David Malosh'

S'Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pizza dough until it is about 1/4-inch thick and roughly a 14 by 13-inch rectangle. Sprinkle 1/2 of the dough surface with all of the olives, 1/2 of the garlic, 2 tablespoons of the grated cheese, and a pinch of salt. Fold the dough over enclosing the toppings and roll to seal and flatten, forming a 14 by 6-inch rectangle. Dust lightly with flour and fold in half again. Set aside and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat add the olive oil, remaining garlic, and a pinch of salt. Heat until the salt is dissolved, the garlic is tender, and the pot is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Reserve the oil mixture for brushing.Once the dough is rested, unfold it and roll it out to 1/4-inch thickness and 14 by 6-inches wide. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, trim the edges, then cut it into 6 by 3/4-inch strips. You should end up with 12 to 14 strips. Tie each strip into a flat knot and arrange them on a parchment lined baking sheet.Brush with the garlic-flavored olive oil, and put the pan in the oven. Bake until the bows are golden brown and cooked through, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, brush once more with garlic olive oil, and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of grated cheese. Serve warm.'

To make the flautas: In a pan over medium heat melt butter and saute onions and jalapenos until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and cayenne pepper and cook until fragrant, another 2 minutes. Add chicken and salsa; stir to combine. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro, cheese and lime juice. Let cool slightly. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.Working with 4 tortillas at a time, spread a heaping spoonful along the middle of each tortilla. Roll tortilla tightly around the filling and secure with a toothpick. Using tongs, hold each flauta in hot oil until firm, then release to continue cooking. Cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes, then remove to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season with salt. Keep flautas warm in the oven on a sheet tray while assembling and cooking the remaining tortillas.To make the Avocado Cream: In a serving bowl, mash avocado, sour cream and lime juice until smooth. Season with salt, to taste. To serve, arrange flautas on a platter of shredded lettuce and serve with Avocado Cream on the side.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To a stand mixer, add the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar. Blend on high with the paddle attachment until the sugar granules are less visible and the mixture is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.Scrape the sides with a rubber spatula, then add the egg and blend on low until combined, stopping to scrape the sides more to incorporate.Prepare the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, add the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and baking soda. Stir and toss with a spoon or fork.Scrape the sides of the mixer bowl and, while off, add half of the flour mixture. Turn on low and mix until combined; this should only take 5 to 6 rotations of the paddle. Stop and scrape the sides again, then add the other half of the flour and mix on low the same way. Turn off the mixer.Add the chopped chocolate chips and crushed candy canes. Turn the mixer back on low and blend until just combined; this should only take 3 to 4 rotations of the paddle.Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop dough balls the size of golf balls, 1 tablespoon each, and place 3 inches apart on the baking sheet, about 8 cookies per sheet. Bake until the edges are set and the center is cooked through, but still soft, 13 to 15 minutes.Cool the cookies for 2 to 3 minutes on the sheets. Then, holding the baking sheet over a wire cooling rack, remove the cookies from the sheet by gripping the baking sheet with one hand and the parchment paper on the opposite side with your other hand. Gently slide the parchment paper off the sheet with the cookies still on top, resting the parchment and cookies on the wire rack beneath until cool. This cookie removal/cooling trick takes coordination, so think about it before you do it and easy on the egg nog.'

S"1. Make the cilantro-avocado cream sauce. In a blender combine the cilantro, avocado, sour cream, lime juice, and a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth. Set aside.2. Make the beef filling. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When it begins to swirl, add the onions, salt, a few grinds of pepper, the cumin, and thyme. Cook, stirring, until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the beef and break up with a spoon or spatula as it browns. When the meat is cooked through, taste and, if needed, season with a pinch of salt.3. Fill the chimichangas. Warm the tortillas in a microwave for just a few seconds or in a 100degreesF oven for a few minutes. Divide the refried beans into 4 equal portions. Using a rubber spatula or the back of a spoon, spread the beans in the center of each tortilla, making a rectangle with the rough dimensions of 6 inches  3 inches.. Using this as a guide add the beef directly over the beans. On a 10-inch tortilla, this leaves 2 inches of tortilla on the rectangle\\'s short side of the filling, and 31/2 inches of tortilla on the long sides.4. Roll the chimichangas. With the length of the rectangle of fillings horizontal to you, use both hands to fold each end with the 2-inch border in and over the mound of beef. Then fold the 31/2-inch flap closest to you over the beef, tuck it in gently, but tightly, and roll the burrito away from you. Set aside. Rest with the seam side down and continue with the rest.5. Fry the chimichangas. Fill a large straight-sided pan with an inch of oil and bring it to 360 degrees F. (The temperature will fall when the burritos are added.) When the oil is hot, add 2 burritos at a time, seam side down, keeping the temperature at 350 degrees F. Cook until golden on the bottom, then roll and cook all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer each to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the second batch.6. Top the chimichangas. Turn on the broiler or preheat your oven to 500 degrees F. Place each chimichanga on a baking sheet, seam side down. Mix the Cheddar and Jack cheeses in a bowl. Top each chimichanga evenly with an equal amount of cheese. Cook until the cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer each to a serving plate and top evenly with lettuce, avocado cream sauce, tomatoes, jalapeno slices, and radish slices."

S'For the mushroom topping: Add the butter, oil, thyme, onions, chiles, salt and pepper to a pan over medium heat. Cook until the onions are tender and the thyme is fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until they lose some moisture and wilt, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to a plate and wipe out the pan to reuse.For the patty: Whisk the Worcestershire, salt, pepper and garlic in a small bowl. Break up the ground chuck in a separate large bowl. Gently combine the Worcestershire and the ground chuck. Form the ground chuck into a ball.Heat the pan over medium-high heat. Place the ball of ground chuck between two sheets of parchment or plastic wrap. Flatten the ball to a size a little larger than the flatbreads, using a rolling pin or the bottom of a glass. Place the flattened patty in the pan and cook on one side until the edges begin to curl under a bit. Flip the patty and cook the other side to your desired amount of doneness, about 5 minutes total.Adjust an oven rack to the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Place one of the flatbreads on a sheet of aluminum foil. Evenly layer the American cheese on top and sprinkle with the bacon. Place the patty on top and evenly spread the mushroom mixture on top.

S'For the fennel: Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.Slice a thin layer off the root end of each fennel bulb. Cut each fennel bulb into 8 wedges, keeping the root end intact. Chop 2 tablespoons fennel fronds and reserve. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the fennel wedges until crisp-tender, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from the water and set aside so the water evaporates and the fennel cools slightly.Brush all sides of the fennel with the olive oil. Season with a sprinkle of salt and a grind or 2 of pepper. Place the fennel bulbs on the grill, 1 cut-side down. Grill the fennel until golden and caramelized, about 4 minutes. Flip and grill 4 minutes more on the other cut side.Meanwhile, for the sauce: Brush the jalapeno with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the jalapeno on the grill and grill on all sides, turning while grilling, until some charring occurs, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the jalapeno from the grill, remove the stem and chop the pepper very well. Place in a medium bowl with the honey, vinegar and reserved fennel fronds. Whisk to bring together and season with salt and pepper.Remove the fennel from the grill and drizzle the sauce over the top. Serve warm.'

S'For the rolls: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.On a lightly floured flat surface, roll out the dough and separate it into 4 rectangular parts, leaving 2 triangles attached for each of the 4 sections. Each section should appear to be a rectangle with a perforated dividing line through its center diagonally. Carefully pinch together the 2 triangles along this line to close the gaps and seal it to make it 1 piece. Cut each piece in half to make 2 squares. Repeat for each and place on a nonstick baking sheet with sides. There should be 8 squares to fill.Combine the candy bars and bacon in a medium bowl. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of the candy mixture in a row along the length of the prepared dough in the center, leaving enough room to pull the uncovered dough on the edges up and over the pile of filling.For the topping: In a small bowl, mix the sour cream and just enough water to make it loose like glue, yes glue. Brush this over the top of each roll and sprinkle with sugar and a pinch of flake salt.Bake until golden on top, 16 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool slightly.'

Add the molasses and ginger and blend until smooth. Then add in the egg and blend until incorporated.Add the dry: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and pumpkin pie spice. Reduce the mixer speed and add the flour mixture in 3 parts, slowly blending and scraping the sides of the bowl to include all the dough. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.Roll, bake and top: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Pour enough sugar into a small bowl to dust the cookies (about 1/3 cup).Using a small melon baller or ice scream scoop, make 24 balls of cookie dough and roll each in the sugar to coat on all sides. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheets 1 inch apart and gently press each down.Bake until the bottoms and edges are browned slightly, about 12 minutes; remove from the oven and immediately push a ginger candy in the center of each cookie so that it cools with it locked in place. Slide the cookies off the sheet by pulling the parchment paper off the sheet and onto a cooling rack. Cool before serving.

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.For the dough:  In a cup, add 1/4 cup cold water and the sazon. Stir to dissolve and set aside. In a food processor, add the flour, butter and salt. Then pulse until the butter is in small pebbles throughout the flour. Slowly add the seasoned water in a stream while pulsing until dough comes together. Remove the dough from the processor, form in to a ball and flatten it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator while you make the filling.For the filling: In a pot, add the chicken, half of the thyme, the smashed garlic cloves and fill the pot with enough water to cover the chicken by an inch. Sprinkle with a nice pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Then lower to a simmer and cook until the chicken reaches internal temperature of 165 degrees F, or juices run clear when punctured, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the chicken parts from the water and rest on a plate to cool. Reserve 1/4 cup of the poaching liquid.Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, add the butter, oil, sliced garlic, serrano pepper, the remaining thyme, sazon, cumin, and season with a pinch of salt and few grinds of pepper. Saute while stirring until the pan is fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the frozen blend and reserved poaching liquid. Turn up the heat to create steam and continue stirring until the vegetable blend is cooked, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the flour in sprinkles and stir to combine. Then add the milk. Allow to simmer and thicken about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.Meanwhile, remove the dough from the refrigerator and sprinkle a flat surface with flour. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Using a knife or pizza wheel, trim the edges. Center the dough in a 8 or 9-inch pie dish, allowing the excess dough to drape over the edges.Remove the skin from the poached chicken, pull the meat from the bones and shred or chop. Stir into the pot along with the crema. Pour the filling into the dough. Flap the excess edges over the top of the pie, making sure to not overlap too much dough at the joints. This amount of dough leaves a hole in the center to vent. In a small bowl, whisk the egg and a splash of water. Brush the egg wash gently on the top of the pie dough.Bake until the crust is golden brown and the insides are bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.'

S'In a large bowl gently combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. Divide ground burger mixture into 4 equal segments and form them into thick patties. Refrigerate on a plate for 1 hour, then remove to and allow to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes before cooking.  In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, mayonnaise and lemon juice and salt, to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve.  Warm a grill pan over high heat. Lightly brush the top of each burger with vegetable oil, then arrange on the grill, oiled side down. Sear until the burgers release easily from the grill and are brown, about 5 minutes. Brush with a bit more vegetable oil, flip and cook until the center slightly springs back, indicating a medium-rare center, another 5 minutes. While the burgers are finishing, brush both sides of the bread lightly with olive oil then put on the grill and cook until toasted, about 1 minute, then flip and toast the other side. Transfer 1 slice to each serving plate and spread with the garlic spread. Top each slice with a burger and while they are resting make the eggs to top each burger. In a small pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over low heat, crack an egg in the center, cover and cook until the white is set and the yolk is still runny, about 5 minutes. Slide the egg on top of the of the burger, season with a bit of salt and pepper, then finish with a few shakes of hot sauce. Repeat with the remaining butter and eggs and serve.'

Turn the oven to 350 degrees F and while it\\'s preheating, place the baking sheet with the donuts inside to toast, flipping once after about 10 minutes. Continue to cook until lightly toasted on both sides, another 5 minutes. Remove the baking sheet and continue to preheat the oven.Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add the cranberries and 1 cup of the orange juice. Bring to a simmer and cook until the cranberries are plump, 10 to 15 minutes (the orange juice will reduce; that\\'s just fine). Set aside.Cube 7 tablespoons of the butter. In a large bowl, add the pecans, flour, salt, lemon zest, 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar and the cubed butter. Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, mix everything together until crumbly. Refrigerate until ready to bake.In a separate large bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar and egg yolks until well incorporated, less gritty and slightly lighter yellow in color. Add the pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract and remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar and whisk until everything is well blended. Slowly add the heavy cream while continuing to whisk, then whisk in the lemon juice and remaining 1 cup orange juice. Slowly add the simmered cranberries and orange juice.Butter the bottom and sides of an 8-by-8-inch casserole dish with the remaining tablespoon of butter. Break the donuts into large chunks and add to the casserole dish. Pour half of the custard mixture over top, making sure to nestle the cranberries in the nooks and crannies. Press everything down into the custard and allow it to soak for 10 minutes. Pour the remaining custard over top. Remove the topping from the refrigerator and sprinkle evenly over the top.Bake until golden brown and bubbly around the edges, 35 to 40 minutes. Let sit 15 minutes before serving warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."

S'Cream the butter, sugar and eggs: In a stand mixer or in a large bowl with a hand mixer on high, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy and smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs one by one, completely incorporating the first one before adding the second, and making sure to scrape the sides between additions. Beat in the almond extract.Add the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, stir to combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Lower the mixer speed to medium-low and pour the flour mixture into the butter mixture in four parts, taking time to blend in and scrape the sides of the bowl back to the center between each addition, until all is combined.Finish the dough and chill: Add the milk 1 tablespoon at a time to the dough and blend until it becomes smooth but firm enough to form balls (you may not need all of the milk). Turn off the mixer and add the cereal, folding it in by hand using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Divide the dough in half and roll into logs 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.Bake and cool the cookies: Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F; line two baking sheets with parchment. Remove the cookie dough from the plastic wrap and slice into 1/2-inch-thick discs. Place 6 discs at least 3 inches apart on each prepared baking sheet (refrigerate the remaining dough until ready to bake). Bake until golden and crispy around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheets. Once the baking sheets are cool, bake the remaining cookies.'

S"In a large container, combine all the ingredients and stir until the salt and sugar dissolve. Put the turkey breasts in the brine, making sure they are completely covered. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.To make the turkey:Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot, sage, thyme, chili flakes, and a pinch of salt; saute for 5 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-high. Add the pears, spreading out in a single layer. Let sit untouched for 2 minutes to brown slightly. Toss, saute 1 minute more, then remove from heat. Transfer the pear mixture to a bowl and add the walnuts, bread crumbs and chicken stock. Stir to combine and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside to cool.  Remove the turkey breasts from brine and pat dry. Butterfly the turkey by slicing the breasts into even halves on the horizontal, leaving about 1/2-inch, uncut at 1 edge so the breasts can open like a book. Season all over with salt and pepper, to taste. Lay a large piece of plastic wrap on a clean cutting board. Put 3 slices of bacon parallel, about 1-inch apart on top of the plastic. Arrange 1 of the open turkey breasts, cut side up, lengthwise on top of the bacon. Scoop half of the stuffing onto 1 half of the turkey breast, fold over the other half, then roll the bacon around it tightly. Make sure the bacon strips lay flat against the turkey. Sprinkle the outside of the bacon with a little paprika. Wrap tightly in the plastic wrap twisting the ends to really seal in the breast to keep its shape. Repeat with remaining bacon, turkey, and stuffing. Transfer the breasts to a sheet tray and rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.   Remove the turkey breasts from refrigerator 1/2 hour before you plan to cook them. Discard the plastic wrap and using 3 pieces of butcher\\'s twine, tie the twine over the center of the 3 bacon strips to secure the breasts when searing. Warm a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Add 1 of the turkey breasts, seam side down, into the skillet and sear until the bacon is slightly crisp and the turkey is lightly browned, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer the turkey breast to a baking sheet lined with a rack. Sear the remaining turkey breast, using 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and add it to the baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the oven and bake until the turkey is cooked through and the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 60 minutes. Remove the turkey from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes before slicing. Cut away the butcher\\'s twine, slice crosswise, arrange on a serving platter and serve."

Let the pork rest at room temperature for 1 hour.In a large Dutch oven on high heat, add the butter and olive oil. Once it begins to swirl, add the pork and allow it to sit and sear to a deep golden brown, then rotate and repeat on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Don\\'t forget the ends!For the pot: Add the apricots around the edges of the pork and cook while moving around for a minute. Add the thyme, garlic, rosemary and enough coconut milk to reach three-quarters of the way up the sides of the loin. Bring to a boil, then lower to a very low simmer and cover. Cook for 1 hour, then flip the loin and cook until tender, another hour.Remove the loin to a plate and cover with aluminum foil for 10 minutes before slicing into 1-inch-thick slices.For the gravy: Remove the herbs from the pot and raise the heat to reduce the coconut milk to a gravy consistency. Taste and season with salt if needed. Stir in the parsley and lime juice, and spoon over the pork slices."

S'Blending Hot Liquids: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid; that prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times, then process on high speed until smooth.'

In the third bowl, add the remaining 1 cup flour, the cornmeal, sugar and a pinch of salt followed by a few grinds of pepper.In a frying pan with straight sides, add enough oil to fill 1-inch deep. Heat until the oil begins to swirl and the handle of a wooden spoon begins to sizzle as soon as it hits the oil. The oil will be about 350 degrees F.Remove the fish from the milk in batches of 6 to 8 chunks. Shake the excess milk off the fish. Dredge in the flour, then the egg wash and then in the flour and cornmeal mixture. Add the batch to the oil, making sure to not overcrowd the pan and bring down the temperature. Fry, flipping once if needed, until a light golden brown and cooked through, about 6 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and season with a sprinkle of salt. Repeat until all the fish chunks are done.In a small bowl, add the hot sauce and sift the sugar on top. Gently stir together. Drizzle over the nuggets or dunk them in the sauce.'

S'For the chicken and pasta: Remove 4 to 5 chipotle peppers and a bit of adobo sauce from the can and rub it all over the chicken; measure out 2 tablespoons of the adobo sauce and set aside for later (reserve any remaining chiles and adobo sauce from the can for another use). Rest the chicken in a bowl or on a plate for 2 hours total, refrigerated first for 1 1/2 hours, then at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes.In a large pot, add the garlic, chicken and the chipotle peppers from the marinade. Add just enough water to cover, then bring to a boil on medium high. Once boiling, turn the heat to the lowest setting and poach the chicken until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and rest (reserve the poaching water for cooking the pasta). Fish out the peppers and discard them; place the garlic cloves in a large bowl and smash them with the back of a spoon or your hands. Once the chicken is cool enough to touch, shred it by hand into bite-size pieces.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Use the butter or cooking spray to coat the bottom and sides of a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish.In the same pot used to poach the chicken, add more water to the poaching water and a nice pinch of salt and bring the pot back to a boil (watch the water; it may foam up a bit from the poaching process). Add the pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package suggests. Drain the pasta in a colander.For the sauce: In the large bowl with the garlic, add the heavy cream, cheese, crema, flour, pepper, scallions, eggs, reserved 2 tablespoons adobo sauce, shredded chicken and cooked pasta. Stir to combine. Pour into the prepared dish.For the topping: In a medium bowl, toss together the crushed chips and cheese. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the dish. Bake, uncovered, until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.'

S"Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk the egg with the granulated sugar until pale. Whisk the milk into the egg mixture, then gently fold into the flour mixture. It should be a bit thicker than pancake batter but thin enough to pour. Add up to 3 tablespoons milk to loosen the batter, if needed.Heat about 2 inches of canola oil in a large high-sided skillet or pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375. Meanwhile, mix the confectioners\\' sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Hold a funnel in one hand with your finger plugging the hole at the bottom. Pour 1 cup batter into the funnel. Hold the funnel over the hot oil and remove your finger from the hole, letting the batter drop in a spiral pattern all over the surface of the oil. It will look like lots of individual pieces at first, but as you continue to add batter, the pieces will fuse together. Cook until the batter floats and the underside is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Flip with tongs and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 30 more seconds. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and repeat to make 5 more funnel cakes. Dust with the cinnamon-sugar and serve with whipped cream and/or fruit sauce, if desired.Photograph by Kana Okada"

Rub the mixture over tenderloins to coat.In a straight-sided oven-proof skillet large enough to fit the entire length of the loins, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat. When hot, add the pork loins and sear on all sides until just golden, about 2 to 3 minutes each side. (Depending on the size of the skillet, you may need to sear in batches.) Transfer to the oven and bake until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the roasts to a cutting board.  Loosely cover with aluminum foil and let rest 10 minutes.Heat the skillet over medium heat, add the remaining oil, the onions, pineapple and garlic. Saute until the pineapple caramelizes slightly. Add the red pepper flakes and saute a few minutes more. Stir in the spinach and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add broth, cover and cook the spinach until it wilts. Slice the pork and arrange on a serving platter. Serve with the greens and pineapples.'

S'For the salad: Prepare the ingredients for the grill. Cut the carrots into halves equal in length. Then cut the smaller tip of the carrot into fourths lengthwise and the larger half into sixths or eighths. The key is making the spears all the about the same size. Line up the prepared carrots, corn and pineapple slices on a tray and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle all with a pinch or two of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Flip the pineapple rings and repeat the process for them only. Roll and jiggle the rest to fully coat them.Grill the prepared ingredients. Heat the grill or grill pan to medium-high. Place the carrots, corn, and pineapple rings directly on the grill. Use tongs to tend to the grill. Roll and flip the vegetables until your personal preference for doneness, pulling each off to a tray when done. The carrots are best when charred, caramelized and a bit crispy on the ends, 10 to 12 minutes. Corn is great fresh, so just go for color on all sides, about 8 minutes total. The pineapples are best when slightly charred, but still juicy, about 6 minutes total, flipping once.Combine the salad ingredients. When the grilled goods are all cool enough to handle, chop the carrots, pineapples and trim the kernels off the corn. Add to a bowl along with the scallions, celery and cucumber.For the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, add the pineapple juice, mustard, apple cider vinegar, sugar and liquid smoke and whisk until combined. Continue to whisk rigorously while slowly pouring the olive oil into the bowl with your other hand, or with the help of a friend, nice to have them in the kitchen! Taste the vinaigrette and season with a pinch of salt and few grinds of black pepper.Dress the salad. Pour the vinaigrette over the bowl then gently toss using tongs. Serve room temperature or chilled.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 9 by 13-inch casserole dish.In a large saucepan, combine the water, thyme, bay leaf, and salt and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the chicken and simmer until cooked through, about 15 minutes, depending on thickness of the chicken. Remove the chicken to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, dice into 1/2-inch cubes and reserve.Return the water to a boil, add the wild rice, and cover. Cook over medium heat until the rice grains split, 40 to 45 minutes. Drain the excess water, transfer the rice to a bowl and set aside.In a small pot, over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of butter. When the butter is melted add the brown sugar, cranberries, rosemary, bread crumbs, and a pinch of salt. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is uniform. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.   In a large straight-sided saute pan over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the mushrooms, onions, and a pinch of salt. Saute until the mushrooms are browned, about 5 minutes. Add the heavy cream and the cinnamon, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer about 2 minutes to thicken slightly. Add the Gruyere and mix to incorporate. Add the rice and chicken to the pot and stir to combine. Season the mixture with salt and pepper, to taste, then transfer it to the prepared casserole dish. Spread the cranberry mixture evenly over the top of the casserole and bake until golden and bubbling, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve hot.'

Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Keep heat on skillet and fry a pinch of the beef in the bacon fat to test seasoning. Adjust seasoning, if needed, then form 8 even thin patties, about 1/2-inch thick and set aside. Saute onions in bacon fat in skillet until tender, 5 minutes. Place onions and bacon in a bowl with cheese. Form a spoonful of bacon-cheese mixture into a ball, then place in the center of 4 patties. Top each with another patty and seal the edges. Grill burgers over medium-high heat, flipping once until desired doneness is reached, approximately 4 minutes each side for medium. Serve in buns with garnishes.  Alternative: In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, sear the burgers 4 minutes on each side.'

Fold uncovered half of the dough over the filling, making sure to press out all the air as you work. The final product should resemble a triangle with 1curved side. Using the tines of a fork, dipped in flour, if needed, crimp the sides to seal. Repeat with remaining 19 pastries. Heat 1-inch of oil in a heavy-bottom skillet to 360 degrees F. Fry the pastries, in batches, until golden, about 2 minutes. Flip and fry 2 minutes more. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain, then transfer to a serving platter.

Mix and mash up any large chunks of tomatoes using a potato masher. Taste and season with salt and pepper if necessary (the mix packet contains lots of seasoning, so you probably won\\'t need to). Add the egg and stir.Pour all but 1/2 cup of the flavor base (tomato mixture) over the top of the beef. Using your less dominant hand with your fingers spread out like a pitchfork, gently mix and fold everything together, turning the bowl with your free hand, until just combined. Don\\'t over-mix!Form the mixture into the shape of a loaf on a parchment-lined baking sheet or press gently into a meatloaf pan. Top the loaf with the remaining flavor base. Cook until the internal temperature is 155 degrees F, 50 to 65 minutes. Remove and gently cover with aluminum foil for 10 minutes to allow the ambient heat to bring it to 160 degrees F before slicing and serving."

S'Put the wings on a baking sheet and season both sides with salt and pepper. Let stand at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.To make the sauce, in a small saucepan, mix together the hoisin, pomegranate juice, brown sugar, garlic, horseradish, scallions, and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring, over medium-high heat. When the sauce starts to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt.In a deep heavy pot, Dutch oven, or deep fryer, fill with oil to a depth of about 6 inches, and heat to 360 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the wings; the oil temperature will settle at about 350 degrees  try to maintain that temperature by adjusting the heat while you fry. Fry the wings until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Drain on paper towels.Put some of the sauce in a large mixing bowl and toss the wings in batches, adding more sauce as needed, until completely coated. Put the onions into another large bowl, add the sauced wings in batches and toss to thoroughly coat. Serve warm.'

Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and the oil to a large stock pot on medium-high heat. When the butter is melted and oil is hot, add the chicken thigh bones and cubed thigh meat. Brown on all sides, then remove the meat to a plate. Lower the heat slightly and add the onions, thyme and bay leaves. Season onions with salt and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic is tender, about 4 minutes more. Stir the chicken back into the pot and add the stock. Raise the heat, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the potatoes and frozen corn and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes more. Meanwhile, make a paste with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the flour, in a small bowl and set aside. When the potatoes are tender remove the thyme sprigs and the bay leaves. Lower the heat and add the milk, cream and the flour paste in bits. Stir to mix and allow the flour to blend into the chowder. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Transfer the chowder to a serving bowl and spritz with lemon before serving.Cook\\'s Note: Don\\'t remove the bones from the soup.

Fill the bowl with cold water and agitate the shredded potatoes and rinse with water until the water runs clear from the colander. Strain the potatoes and pour into a clean kitchen towel, gather the edges and twist the towel around to squeeze the excess water out of the potatoes. Do this as hard as possible, changing towels if needed to remove the most moisture. Transfer the dried potato shreds to a large bowl. Add the garlic powder, onion powder, Hungarian paprika, 2 teaspoons of salt, and a grind or two of pepper. Toss with your hands to combine.In a large nonstick saute pan on medium heat, add the olive oil and shredded potatoes. Spread the potatoes evenly and allow a bottom crust to build before tossing to cook some more. Continue to cook while tossing until most of the hash browns are golden, 10 to 12 minutes.

S'In a large bowl, add the beef and break it up a little. From high above the bowl for even coverage, sprinkle over the onion pulp, 1 teaspoon of the curry powder, the onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of pepper and the thyme. Gently mix with your non-dominant hand until just combined. Form into 4 equal balls and let rest in the bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil, cover with plastic wrap and rest at room temperature 1 hour.In a liquid measuring cup, whisk the tomatoes, ketchup, honey, hot sauce and the remaining 2 teaspoons curry powder until combined.Preheat 4 personal-sized cast-iron pans over medium-high heat. Form each ball of beef into a patty and press each patty to fill the entire bottom of each pan; the patties will shrink as they cook. Cook until each patty easily lifts from the pan and a peek beneath reveals a golden-brown sear, about 5 minutes. Flip the patties, then immediately pour the tomato mixture evenly over each and jiggle the pans to settle the sauce.Using the back of a spoon, gently press a recess in the center top of each patty. Gently crack an egg into the center of each patty, resting the yolk in the recess you created. Cover all the pans with a large baking sheet. Reduce the heat to a low simmer and leave covered until a quick peek beneath reveals the whites are cooked and the yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Garnish each with a tiny sprinkle of salt over the yolks, a grind of pepper and a sprinkle of parsley.'

S'Brine: In a large bowl add the water, salt, sugar and lime juice, stirring to dissolve. Add the chicken and refrigerate, covered, for 12 hours or overnight.Rub: Tear the chiles roughly into 1-inch pieces and toast in a pan over medium heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes.  Let cool slightly, then transfer them to a food processor along with the salt, garlic powder and lime zest. Pulse into a coarse powder. Remove the rub to a large bowl.Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry. Add chicken to the rub and coat all of the pieces well. Let rest on the countertop until chicken comes to room temperature or up to 2 hours.In a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot, heat enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 350 degrees F.Set up a dredging station: Put the flour, cornstarch and a pinch of salt and pepper in a paper bag. In a large bowl whisk the eggs, milk and a pinch of salt and pepper, to taste. Dredge the chicken, 1 piece at a time, to the paper bag and toss. Remove with tongs, dip in the egg wash then return them to the paper bag for a second toss. Shake off the excess flour and add the chicken pieces to the oil in batches, making sure to keep frying temperature at around 350 degrees F. Fry the chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 to 12 minutes depending on piece of chicken. Remove the chicken to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Arrange the chicken on a serving platter and season with salt, to taste, and a spritz of lime juice. Serve with honey for dipping.'

S'Prepare the grapefruit. Juice one grapefruit into a liquid measure. On the second grapefruit, slice the bottom and top to level it, then starting at the top where the white pith ends and the pink flesh begins, cut between the 2 layers at an angle from the top to bottom all the way around to remove the skin and expose the flesh, making sure to slice off all the pithy white parts. Holding the grapefruit in one hand, release the wedges by using the knife to slice on either side of each segment.Place these wedges in a medium saute pan. Squeeze the remaining flesh and membranes of the grapefruit to release any juice into a bowl. Add the sugar and honey. Whisk to combine, then taste. If needed, add a teaspoon or more brown sugar to take away the tart of the grapefruit. Pour half of the mixture into a saute pan with the grapefruit wedges. Bring to a simmer and cook until liquid is reduced and slightly thickened, about 8 minutes.To the remaining half add the oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Whisk to combine and pour into a plastic bag. Add the chicken, seal and toss a bit before resting on the counter for 25 to 30 minutes. Cook\\\'s Note: Any longer and the acid in the grapefruit juice will "cook" the chicken in the marinade and ruin it.Heat a grill pan to medium high and brush lightly with oil. Remove the chicken from the plastic bag and shake off the excess marinade. Place the smooth-side down on the grill and cook 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and cook 2 minutes more. Remove to a serving plate and pour the grapefruit sauce over the top.'

S'Prepare the steaks: Arrange the steaks in a dish; season with salt and pepper on both sides, sprinkle evenly with the liquid smoke and drizzle with the vegetable oil. Nestle the rosemary under the steaks and set aside at room temperature 2 hours, turning the steaks halfway through to infuse both sides with rosemary.Make the rosemary butter: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the butter and 1 teaspoon salt. Melt the butter, stirring to dissolve the salt, then add the garlic and rosemary. Continue cooking over low heat until the butter is fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the garlic and rosemary; set the butter aside.Grill the steaks: Preheat a grill or grill pan to high. Remove the steaks from the dish, discard the rosemary and place the steaks on the grill. Cook about 5 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove from the grill, tent with foil and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.Meanwhile, make the eggs: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk the eggs and add a splash of water (nothing more than a teaspoon). Melt the butter in a large nonstick pan over low heat but do not let it brown. Add the eggs and cook, whisking to release the cooked egg from the pan, until almost done but still wet, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat; add half of the cheese, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper and continue whisking until done. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.To serve, cut the steaks off the bone and slice against the grain; drizzle with the rosemary butter. Serve with the eggs.Photograph by Con Poulos'

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Prick each potato all over several times with a fork. Rub the oil on the potatoes and sprinkle the skin with salt and pepper. Place the prepared potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until the potatoes are fork tender, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool on the countertop before you handle.Lower the oven to 375 degrees F.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the scallions, garlic, onion powder, dry mustard, 4 ounces cheese, cream cheese and 1 teaspoon salt.Slice a 1/4-inch "lid" off of each potato lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop out the insides and leave about a 1/8-inch thick rim around the inside of the potato halves to keep them sturdy. To make things easier, slide a butter knife around the edges of the inside before scooping. Scrape the little bit of flesh still attached to the "lid" you sliced off and discard the leftover skin. Place the hollowed potatoes back on the baking sheet. Mash the potato flesh in a small bowl, and then add to the bowl with other ingredients. Mash together and slowly stir in the heavy cream. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if needed. Scoop this mixture back into the empty potato skins, sprinkle with the remaining 1 ounce cheese evenly over the tops and return the potatoes to the oven to bake until the tops are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove and sprinkle with bacon bits, of using.Cook\\\'s Note: If you have a small ice cream scoop, use it to scoop the mixed potato flesh back into the hollowed potatoes. It\\\'s much easier this way.'

S'To make the marinade: In a blender or food processor combine banana peppers, mustard, and honey. Blend until smooth, and set aside 3 tablespoons for the pasta sauce.Pour the remaining marinade into a re-sealable plastic bag. Season the pork with salt and pepper and add them to the bag. Seal and distribute the marinade equally on the pork. Marinate at room temperature up to 2 hours or in the refrigerator if longer than that. Remove the pork from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to let pork come to room temperature.Preheat a seasoned cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat.Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil for the pasta.Remove the pork medallions from the marinade and give a gentle shake to remove excess marinade. Place on the grill pan. Let cook 4 minutes per side or until cooked through. Remove from the pan and loosely tent with aluminum foil while the meat rests.Meanwhile, cook the pasta in salted boiling water until al dente, about 12 minutes. In a medium saute pan on medium heat, heat the oil. When it begins to swirl, add the onions. Season the onions with salt and pepper, and sweat until tender.Add the garlic and cook another minute. Add reserved marinade and stir. Once combined, add the heavy cream and stir until slightly reduced and thickened, about 8 minutes.Stir in the grated Parmesan, and parsley. Drain the pasta and add to sauce, coating well. Serve alongside pork.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  In a small bowl, dissolve the sazon in warm water and set aside. Warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and jalapeno and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and garlic. When the garlic begins to brown, add the sazon water, cumin, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Saute until the aromas blend, about 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat, add 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce and set aside to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and add the ground beef. Mix until evenly incorporated.  Stuff the cubanelle peppers with the ground beef mixture, using the end of wooden spoon to help ensure stuffing is tightly packed in. Brush the outside of the peppers with remaining olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste. Pour the remaining tomato sauce into an 11 by 9-inch baking dish and arrange the stuffed peppers in the dish. Bake until the peppers are golden brown and the internal temperature registers 140 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 50 to 60 minutes.'

S'Working, 1 at a time, scrub any grit from shells under running water. Discard open mussels that do not close with a few taps of the finger and any with cracked shells. Put the mussels in a bowl of cold water.Heat the oil in a large wide pot over medium-high heat and add the chorizo. Using a wooden spoon or potato masher, mash the chorizo into chunks, so it resembles ground beef. Saute until brown, about 8 minutes. Remove chorizo to a bowl. In the same pot, add the onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Saute 3 minutes to sweat. Deglaze the pan with the wine. Pull the mussels from bowl and transfer them and the water to the pot, do not strain, leaving behind any sand and grit that has sunk to the bottom. Stir to coat. Add the chorizo back into the pot and cover. Cook over medium heat until the mussels open, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large serving bowl, sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.'

S"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the bottoms and sides of the mini muffin tins with cooking spray.For the dough:  In a food processor, pulse the pecans, sugar, salt and flour until the nuts are ground and the ingredients are combined. Add in the butter and pulse until dough resembles coarse meal. Slowly pour in the ice water through the feed tube until the dough comes together. Remove from processor bowl to a clean work surface sprinkled with flour. Form the dough into a ball and divide evenly into 24 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and evenly press into each cup until the bottom is covered. If the dough is sticky, dip your finger in flour first. Bake 15 to 18 minutes, until the crusts are very golden. Check periodically to make sure they don\\'t get too brown. Meanwhile, make the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the egg , egg yolk, corn syrup, sugar, pumpkin filling and vanilla. Stir in the chopped pecans. Remove the dough from oven and spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling into each cup. Top each with 1 pretty pecan half. Return the pans to the oven and continue baking, for 12 to 15 minutes more, until the pumpkin filling is set. Allow to cool before removing from the pans."

S"In a large saute pan, melt the butter and then add the brown sugar, salt, and pecans, in that order, with a stir between each. Stir on medium-high as bubbles form, and continue to stir until the sugar is dissolved as much as possible and the coating on the pecans becomes sticky, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and spread the mixture onto a baking sheet to cool. Refrigerate for about 10 minutes.Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, buttermilk, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract. Use a spatula to release the pecans from the cooled sheet. Add the cooled pecans to the bowl and stir. Make the ice cream one of the following ways:1. Get fancy and put it in your home ice cream maker and prepare according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Place in an air tight 2-quart container and freeze for at least 5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, then every hour for 3 more hours.2. Add 2 cups ice and 1/2 cup coarse sea salt to a large plastic storage container. Pour the ice cream mixture into a 1-gallon plastic storage bag and seal, squeezing out as much air as possible. Place this bag in the plastic storage container and cover with the lid. Shake vigorously for 10 to 15 minutes. Add more ice and salt if needed halfway through the spin cycle. Depends on your shakin\\'! Once the shaking is done and you\\'ve checked for the right texture for your ice cream, remove the bag from the container and rinse off quickly in cold water. Open and scoop ice cream out, or cut a hole in the corner of the bag and squeeze it out."

Cook, stirring to keep the onions from browning, until the chorizo is cooked through and broken down to resemble ground meat, about 10 minutes.For the cornmeal: Into the skillet with the chorizo, add the milk, buttermilk and cornmeal. Bring to a simmer while whisking, to keep the cornmeal from clumping or sticking in the corners. When the liquid begins to thicken, turn off the heat and continue to stir until the mixture is the texture of loose grits.In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs while very slowly adding a bit of the cornmeal mixture. Whisk vigorously to combine and then feel the outside of the bowl. If it\\'s not warm, add a bit more of the cornmeal mixture while continuously whisking; keep adding the cornmeal mixture until the eggs are just as warm as the cornmeal mixture. Then, reversing the order, slowly pour the egg mixture into the cornmeal mixture, whisking vigorously.

S'Combine the parsley and cilantro (leaves and stems), garlic, half of the sliced onion, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, vinegar, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1/2 cup olive oil in a food processor; blend into a thick and smooth chimichurri sauce. Pierce both sides of the steak with a fork several times; place in a resealable plastic bag and add half of the sauce. Seal the bag and turn to coat the steak; refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Cover and reserve the remaining sauce.Preheat a grill to medium-high. Remove the steak from the bag (discard the bag of sauce); season with salt and pepper and grill until medium-rare, about 6 minutes per side. Let rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the peppers and the remaining sliced onion half; season with salt and pepper. Saute until the vegetables are softened and caramelized around the edges, about 8 minutes. Add the beer, cover and cook until the peppers are tender, about 5 minutes.Warm the tortillas on the grill. Thinly slice the steak on the bias; divide among the tortillas along with the peppers and onions. Thin the reserved chimichurri sauce with the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice; drizzle over the fajitas. Serve with lime wedges, if desired.Photograph by Kana Okada'

S'Toast the baguette cubes: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, add the baguette cubes and drizzle over the olive oil. Toss until the bread is coated. Sprinkle over a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper then toss again. Pour onto a nonstick baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden on all sides, making sure to remove and toss in 3 to 4 minute intervals. This should take 12 to 14 minutes. Remove and allow the cubes to cool slightly before tossing back into the large bowl.Make the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, combine the mustard, lemon zest and lemon juice. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Add the jalapenos and onions and allow them to soak in the vinaigrette for 10 minutes.Build the salad: To the large bowl of toasted baguette cubes, add the baby spinach, black olives and tomatoes. Toss gently. Pour over the vinaigrette and toss until combined. Serve at room temperature.'

S'In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, add the butter, peanut butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar, and blend on medium-high speed until creamy. Turn off the mixer and use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl, pushing everything back towards the center. Then add the salt, vanilla and egg, and blend until combined. Lower the speed of the mixer and add the flour in 1/2-cup intervals. Between each addition be sure to completely blend in all the flour and scrape the sides as before. Once completely combined, scrape the dough out of the mixer, add to a container with a lid and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator and, using a tablespoon, scoop out the dough and roll into a ball between your hands. Then roll the formed ball in the turbinado sugar and place on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat for the rest of the balls, making sure to separate them on the sheet by about 1 inch. Try chopping roasted peanuts and adding them to the sugar before rolling out all the balls or add a drop of food coloring to the sugar to make the cookies even more festive!Once all the balls are on the baking sheet, make an indentation in the center of each using the rounded end of a wooden spoon, the back of a rounded teaspoon or your good old-fashioned thumb. Fill the center of each with about 1/2 teaspoon strawberry preserves. Bake until lightly golden, about 12 minutes. Remove to a wire rack. Let cool before serving.'

S"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.Cut the potatoes in quarters lengthwise. Using a paring knife and plenty of patience, cut each quarter into 1 or 2 torpedo- or oval-shaped pieces. Place in a large bowl of cold water while you finish the rest.Add the potatoes to the boiling water and blanch for just under 4 minutes. (This really depends on the size of your potatoes, but be sure to not cook them for potato salad; this is just to get them slightly tender--you shouldn\\'t be able to get a fork through them. The oven will do the rest.) Remove the potatoes from the water to a paper towel-lined plate until slightly cooled.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Pour the potatoes into a large bowl and drizzle over enough olive oil to coat all sides. On a large baking sheet with sides, add the thyme and rosemary (whole) to make a bed of sorts. Pour out the potatoes onto the sheet and space them evenly so the air can circulate as they roast. Season the entire sheet with a pinch of salt.Roast the potatoes until golden brown on the edges and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes."

Taste, then season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper.Remove the shrimp from the ice bath, dry gently with a paper towel and coarsely chop. Stir into the dressing until combined.Cut the iceberg lettuce into 4 wedges. Tear the first few layers from the center of each wedge to create a "bowl" in the wedge; divide among plates. Fill the lettuce bowls with the shrimp salad, letting it spill over the wedge. Garnish with chopped dill. Serve cold or at room temperature.Photograph by David Malosh'

Add the vegetable stock and apple cider and then cover. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until tender.In batches, carefully puree the contents of the pot in a blender or use an immersion blender. Taste and season with salt. Serve warm or chilled.When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.'

Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the bread cubes and toast, tossing, until golden, about 6 minutes. Set aside to cool.Make the bacon: Mix the brown sugar, paprika, lemon zest and crushed pepper in a small bowl. Add the bacon and press to coat on both sides. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; place the thyme sprigs on the parchment paper, then lay a strip of bacon on top of each sprig. Bake until the bacon is caramelized and crisp, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly on the baking sheet. Cut the bacon into bite-size bits using scissors; add to the bowl with the lettuce. Discard the thyme.Make the dressing: Whisk the mayonnaise, syrup, mustard and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Add the dressing to the salad and toss. (This is enough dressing for the whole salad, but you can use less if you want a less wet salad.) Sprinkle the croutons on top and eat.Photograph by Kang Kim'

S'For the steaks: In a small bowl, combine the paprika, thyme, salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Sprinkle on both sides of the steaks and let rest at room temperature for up to 2 hours.In a large pan with straight sides, add the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the steaks and sear on both sides until a deep golden color is on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook about 4 minutes more. Remove to a plate and cover with aluminum foil.For the gravy: Using kitchen twine, tie the thyme and rosemary together. In the same pan you seared the steaks in, add the herb bundle and the butter. Lower the heat to medium, melt the butter and then add the onions. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of black pepper. Cook on medium heat until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes, and then add the garlic. When the garlic becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes, add the stone-ground mustard and beef stock. Stir to blend and then add the heavy cream. Taste and season with more salt, if needed, and raise the heat to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce has thickened to a gravy, lower the heat and stir in the sour cream. Add the reserved steaks back into the pan and bring to a simmer while spooning the sauce over the steaks. Cook this way until desired doneness; it should take only a minute more for medium-rare. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Place the slices on a serving plate and pour the gravy over the top.'

When the oil begins to swirl, add the batter in batches to the pan using a small ice cream scoop or 1/4 cup measure to make each hoecake. Gently spread into a circle, if needed. Flip the hoecakes when the air pockets begin to pop on the surface of the batter and a peek underneath the cake reveals a golden rim and surface, about 2 minutes.Once the second side is golden brown, transfer the hoecakes to a baking sheet in a warm oven and continue making the rest.

S'For the brine: In a large bowl, add the water, salt, and coffee. Stir to dissolve the salt and add the rib roast. If the liquid does not cover all of the meat, flip the roast halfway through the marinating time. Or, consider pouring the marinade into a large plastic bag, adding the rib roast, and then sealing tightly so that the roast is completely surrounded by the brine. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.For the rub: In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, sage, paprika, parsley, garlic powder, white pepper, bread crumbs, coffee grounds, salt, and a nice grind or two of freshly ground black pepper.Remove the roast from the refrigerator and discard the brining liquid. Pat the roast dry with a paper towel. Using your hands, coat the roast on all sides with the rub, gently massaging it into the flesh. Let it rest on the counter to come to room temperature, about 1 hour.Place in a roasting pan and put it in the oven. Cook until medium-rare, 125 degrees F, about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover lightly with aluminum foil while the meat rests, 15 minutes. Slice between the ribs and serve.'

S'For the bacon and veggies: In a large straight-sided pan with a lid, add the oil and bacon and cook on medium-high heat until the bacon is crisped. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving the fat in the pan.Add the onions, pepper flakes, thyme and bell peppers. Cook, stirring, until the onions and peppers are tender and the pan is fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and stir to combine. Pick out and discard the thyme stems. Remove the vegetables to a separate plate.For the chops: To the same pan, add the butter and olive oil. Once the butter is melted and the pan is hot, add the pork chops and sear on one side until a peek beneath reveals a golden color, about 4 minutes. Remove the chops to the plate with the vegetables.In the same pan still on medium high, add the apple butter and 1 1/4 cups water. Use a wooden spoon to scrape any bits off the bottom of the pan. Add the chops back into the pan, then surround and cover them with the vegetable mixture. Pour the tomatoes over the top, lower the heat to a low simmer and cover halfway. Cook until the desired doneness, usually 5 to 10 minutes lends itself to a lovely pink center.Allow to rest 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with the reserved bacon and chopped parsley or cilantro. Serve with Garlic Red Bliss Mash.'

Add the cream and beat on medium-high speed until smooth and the consistency of whipped cream. Arrange half of the cake cubes in the bottom of a 13-cup trifle dish. Sprinkle evenly with a layer of blueberries. Dollop half of the cream mixture over the blueberries and gently spread. Top with a layer of strawberries. Layer the remaining cake cubes on top of the strawberries, then sprinkle with more blueberries and top with the remaining cream mixture. Finish with the remaining strawberries and blueberries, arranging them in a decorative pattern. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.Photograph by Steve Giralt'

S'Divide the chocolate hazelnut spread among the tortillas and spread evenly over half of the surface of each.On a griddle or in a large skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter until bubbly. Add 1 or 2 of the tortillas, spread-side up, to the griddle. Spread 1/3 cup marshmallows in an even, single layer over the chocolate spread on each tortilla. Cook until the tortillas bubble in the pan and turn light golden brown on the bottom.Using a spatula, quickly fold the uncovered half of the tortilla over the marshmallows, making a half-circle. Press on the top of the tortillas gently to seal. When the marshmallows are slightly melted and spongy, flip the crepe and let stand in the pan until the underside is just hot; do not overcook.Transfer the crepes to a cutting board and let stand for 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining butter, tortillas, and marshmallows.To serve, put the chopped hazelnuts on a plate. Cut the crepes in half crosswise, and then quickly press the cut side and round edges into the nuts to adhere. Sprinkle additional nuts over the top and serve immediately garnished with banana slices, if desired.'

S"Make the eggs: In a large nonstick pan or two medium nonstick pans, add the butter (do the division if using 2 pans). Turn the pan on low and allow the butter to gently melt without browning. Once it is melted, tilt and swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides (this will help you slide the eggs out later).Ok, pay close attention: We are going to Frankenyolk these eggs. That means you\\'ll make one egg have two yolks. (If you get lucky and get a double-yolk jumbo egg, go buy a lottery ticket.) Crack one egg into the pan. Then separate the second egg over a bowl, leaving just the yolk in one side of the shell and the whites in the bowl. Take the yolk in the shell and, using the edge of the shell, gently break the thick clear albumen (egg white) of the egg already in the pan and pour the separated yolk right next to the other yolk. Keep the yolks next to each other so they cook at the same time. Repeat this process with the rest of the eggs so you have 4 eggs with 2 yolks each. What to do with the whites? Make an egg white omelet the next day if you feel guilty. If not, how about a meringue pie for dessert tonight? Haaaiii!!Cook the eggs on medium-low heat until the whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny. This takes a good 8 to 10 minutes, so be patient and work on the other steps. Brown edges on a fried egg are just wrong in my book. If the eggs finish before the other steps, just remove the pan(s) from the heat.Cook the refried beans: In a medium pot, add the oil and chorizo and cook on medium heat, using a wavy potato masher or wooden spoon to break the chorizo into bits to create crumbles like ground beef. Once the orange fat is rendered, add the onions, a tiny pinch of salt and cumin and the garlic and cook, stirring them into the chorizo. When the onions are tender and stained with the fat of the chorizo, add the refried beans and chopped pickled jalapenos. Cook until the beans are softened and loose. If they dry up a bit, add a splash of water or, if you are feeling slightly dangerous, add a bit of the pickling juice from the jalapenos. Keep warm.Char the tortillas: In a large dry pan (cast-iron, please) or griddle over high heat, add the stack of tortillas. Cook and flip in a way that once the bottom tortilla is charred, it moves to the top of the stack, flipped. Continue to flip and alternate sides until each tortilla has had a date with the bottom of the pan. Time to build your plate!Build your plate: Place equal amount of the refried beans on each plate. Slightly level them out with the back of your spoon. Sprinkle each with an equal amount of cheese and then slide a double-yolk sunny-side up egg on top. Sprinkle some pico de gallo around the edges so you don\\'t mess with the yolks. Season each yolk with salt and a crack of black pepper. Sprinkle the entire plate with cilantro and spritz with lime juice and a shake of hot sauce. Serve each plate with 2 folded charred tortillas."

S"For the cauliflower: In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and butter to melt. Once melted, add the cauliflower florets, a nice sprinkle of salt and cook until golden on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Give a good toss and let cook for 3 more minutes. Repeat tosses until most of the cauliflower is coated with the butter and golden on parts, about 4 tosses or so. Cauliflower should still be crunchy at this point, but tender enough to eat a smaller floret. Go ahead, take a bite! Then, pour the rest of the florets into a large bowl and quickly cover tightly with plastic wrap. Cook in batches if the florets won\\'t fit into one pan.While the cauliflower continues to steam in the bowl, make the sauce. In the same pan over medium heat, add the butter. Once the butter is melted, add the onions, curry powder, turmeric and season with salt. Cook until tender, about 5 minutes, and then add the garlic and cook a bit more. Once the garlic is fragrant, add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Cook until the stock is reduced by half, and then add the heavy cream and raise to a simmer. Cook until the sauce is reduced and thickened. With a slotted spoon, remove the cauliflower from the bowl and add to the pot. Raise the heat and simmer 5 minutes more. Serve warm."

Cook until the greens of the scallions are wilted and darkened with the oil and the garlic is tender and slightly golden, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, season with salt and cook while stirring until the tomatoes are softened, about 2 minutes. Add the clam juice and lemon juice, bring to a light simmer and stir. Taste, and if the tomatoes and lemon juice are too tart, add sugar and stir.Sprinkle the shrimp with salt and pepper and add to the pan. Cook on 1 side until the shrimp begins to turn opaque and curl slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Then toss and cook until they just begin to turn pink on the other side, 1 to 2 more minutes. (Shrimp cooks fast and there\\'s a thin line between done and overdone; the best rule is to remove the pan from the heat as they begin to reach the finish line. Continue tossing and the heat of the pan will continue to cook them until done.) Serve warm or chilled."

S'For the topping: In a medium bowl, add the flour, brown sugar, butter, pecans, sage, orange zest and a pinch of salt. Mix with your hands until it feels like you could make a ball that would just slightly hold together and everything is crumbly. Take a tiny bite; it should be slightly sweet with a hint of salt (like a good chocolate chip cookie!). Add a tiny pinch more of salt as needed. Cover the bowl and place in the freezer while finishing the recipe. Remove from the freezer 5 minutes before using and break apart with a fork as if you were flaking rice.For the filling: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Poke the sweet potatoes about 6 to 8 times, about 1/4-inch deep, using a fork. Rub with the oil and set the potatoes on a baking sheet. Roast on the middle rack until fork tender and the skins are darkened, 40 to 50 minutes. Set aside to cool. By the time the potatoes are cool enough to handle, the skins will loosen from the flesh. With your hands, gently remove the skins and discard. Place the sweet potato flesh in a large bowl along with the cream, flour, brown sugar, butter and pumpkin pie spice. Mash until smooth.Shift the oven rack one level down and turn on the broiler. Spread out the marshmallows in a single layer on a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and broil, watching the entire time. When the tops of the marshmallows char to a black color and begin smoking (be strong, brown looks good, but black tastes better!), quickly remove from the oven. Lower the oven to 375 degrees F. With a rubber spatula, fold the marshmallows into the mashed sweet potatoes until combined. Taste and add a bit more brown sugar if needed, a tablespoon at a time; this should be just on the edge of sweet, the topping does the rest. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and fold them into the sweet potatoes to combine.Spread the sweet potato mixture into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, leveling the top. Sprinkle the prepared topping evenly over the potatoes. Bake until the topping is shiny and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve warm.'

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.For the bottom layer: In a large pan on medium-high heat, add the oil, sausage and chorizo. Using a wooden spatula or, even better, a wired and wavy potato masher, break up the chorizo and sausage until they are homogenous and resemble ground beef in its tiniest form. Once broken down, continue to cook until the sausage is cooked through and orange fat is rendered from the chorizo, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon to drain off excess fat, transfer the mixture to an 8-by-8-inch casserole dish.For the middle layer: In the same pan with the remaining fat from the meat, quickly add and saute the onions and peppers with a pinch of salt and pepper until tender and the moisture from being frozen is cooked out, 5 to 8 minutes. As before, use a slotted spoon to transfer the pepper/onion mixture to the casserole dish, draining off excess fat, and evenly spread this mixture over the top of the meat layer.Next, evenly layer the mozzarella cheese over the vegetables. Then use the American cheese slices to create another layer, pressing down once done to make everything level and compact.For the top layer: In a large bowl, add the hash browns, butter, steak rub and remaining fat from the pan. Season generously with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Sprinkle this layer on top of the cheese and gently press down, but not too tight so steam can escape.Bake, uncovered, until the top is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve with a shake of hot sauce or sunny-side up eggs over the top.'

S"In a liquid measuring cup whisk in order, starting with the honey, molasses, 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, pomegranate juice, and wine. Cook\\'s Note: Starting with the sticky ingredients then adding the liquid makes it easier to blend.Pour half of the mixture into a large resealable plastic bag. Add to the bag the peppercorns, vegetable oil, and steak. Seal and massage the steak a bit before letting it rest at room temperature for 1 hour. If you need more time than that, refrigerate it, but make sure to bring it to room temperature before you grill it.Pour the rest of the marinade, onions, and garlic into a small saucepot over medium-high heat.  Bring to a boil then cover and lower to a simmer until the liquid reduces and thickens, about 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.Heat the grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.Remove the steak from the plastic bag and gently pat dry. Discard the marinade from the plastic bag. Season the steak on both sides with a sprinkle of salt. Place on the grill, it\\'s totally okay if a few peppercorns from the marinade hang on for dear life and go for a ride on the grill with the steak.Cook until the steak easily releases from the grill, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook the second side for 5 minutes more for medium rare, which is best for this cut. Remove from the grill to a plate, cover with aluminum foil and let the steak rest 10 minutes, allowing the juices to redistribute before you slice it. Make notice of the direction the muscles in the steak are traveling and make sure to cut across or perpendicular to that direction to achieve the most tender results. Place the slices of steak in a serving dish and pour the glaze and onions over the top."

Heat a 10-inch cast-iron pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. When the oil begins to swirl, add the seasoned chicken and saute until cooked through, about 4 minutes on the first side and 3 minutes on the second side. Remove the chicken to a plate with tongs, leaving the oil in the pan. Rest the chicken for a few minutes, and then chop into 1/2-inch cubes.To the same pan, add the onions and peas and carrots and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir and cook until the onions become tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Sprinkle in the flour and stir until the flour dissolves into the vegetables and juices. Add the chicken stock and raise to a simmer, stirring until thickened. Once the liquid has thickened, stir in the heavy cream. Season with salt, if needed.Return the chicken to the pan. Unfold the pie crust and place over the top of the filling, tucking the excess edges inside the pan. Brush the crust evenly with the egg wash. Using a knife, gently cut 3 vents in the top of the crust. Place in the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.'

Run each piece of chicken through these bowls in the order of setting them up: flour, egg then panko.In a large straight-sided pan, add enough oil to just cover the bottom by about 1/4 inch. Heat on medium high and when the oil begins to swirl, add the chicken in batches, placing each piece in the oil away from you so there is less splatter. Add more oil between batches if needed. Cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and season with a pinch of salt and a tiny spritz of lemon.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To make the Spicy Tartar Sauce: Mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl until well combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.In a deep 12-inch pan set over medium-high heat, add enough oil so it comes 1/3 of the way up the sides. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F.In a wide-mouth bowl, whisk the eggs with the hot sauce, seafood seasoning and a pinch of salt. In a small paper bag, mix together the cornmeal, flour, cornstarch, and salt and pepper, to taste. Dredge the catfish in egg mixture, then in the flour mixture. Gently shake off excess flour. Set aside and repeat with remaining flounder. Fry the fish in batches until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes each side, being careful to keep the temperature at 375 degrees F. Remove catfish to a paper towel to drain and immediately season with salt.Slice the sandwich rolls in half, slather the cut sides with butter and season with salt. Arrange, cut side up, on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly golden, about 8 minutes. An alternate is to put them, buttered side down, on a griddle or under a broiler, and toast until golden. Set aside.To assemble sandwiches, slather the rolls with the Spicy Tartar Sauce, top with lettuce and catfish, and serve.'

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Put the bell peppers, onion, garlic, and peppercorns on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with a healthy pinch of salt. Mix with your hands to fully coat the vegetables, and arrange the bell peppers, skin side up, so that the garlic and peppercorns can hide under the cavity of the bell pepper halves. Roast until the skin of the peppers begins to blacken and pucker, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately put all of the ingredients and residue from the baking sheet into a bowl, and quickly cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let the peppers steam for about 5 minutes. Remove the pepper halves and, using your fingers, remove their skin by gently ripping and pulling it off, and return the peeled peppers to the bowl.Add the mixture to a blender along with the chili sauce. Pulse lightly until almost smooth, but still having a slight texture. Season, to taste, with salt and pour it into a small bowl.'

S"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Butter a baking sheet and line it with buttered parchment paper. Set aside.Mix the vinegar, cornstarch and vanilla in a small bowl and set aside. In a stand mixer, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, slowly add 1/4 cup of sugar. Continue beating to stiff peaks. Slowly whisk the vinegar mixture into the meringue until well incorporated.Spread the meringue evenly on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the coconut, walnuts, almonds and pecans evenly over the meringue. Bake until the coconut begins to turn golden and the whites are shiny and springy, about 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely.Meanwhile, combine the strawberries and drained pineapple in a bowl and set aside.In a clean bowl whisk the heavy cream and remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar to stiff peaks and reserve.Use a knife to release the edges and remove the meringue from the pan. Gently flip the meringue onto a parchment-lined surface, nut side down.  Spread the whipped cream over meringue and sprinkle evenly with strawberry mixture, leaving a 1-inch border around the perimeter of the meringue. Leave a little extra room at 1 of the short ends to help seal the pavlova when it\\'s rolled. Starting with the short side with more fruit, slowly roll the meringue into a log, keeping the roll as tight as possible and tucking in the fruit as you go. Use a serrated knife to slice the ends for clean edges. Cut into 2-inch slices and transfer to a serving dish for serving."

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Coating: Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and set aside.Season the lamb all over with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat the oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to swirl, add the lamb and sear it on all sides until golden and a nice crust has formed, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the lamb from the pan and brush with mustard on all sides. Press the coating onto the lamb, making sure to cover all sides. Put the lamb, bone side down, back in the pan and put it in the oven. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 125 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, and the coating is golden brown, anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes for medium-rare. Remove the lamb from the oven and let it rest 5 minutes before serving.'

Put the diced apples in a bowl with the cinnamon and lemon juice. In a large bowl or stand mixer add the butter and 2 cups of sugar and beat until smooth. Add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, and blend to completely incorporate before adding the next. The mixture will become very light in color. Add the buttermilk and the extracts and mix to combine. Stir in 3 cups of flour along with the baking powder and stir until incorporated.In a separate clean dry bowl, whisk egg whites until foamy, then add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and whisk until shiny and soft peaks form when removing the whisk from the whites.  Gently fold this into the cake batter. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan. Arrange the apples in the center of the ring all the way around, being sure they don\\'t touch the outer or inner edge of the pan. Pour in the remaining batter and bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and cool completely. Put a large plate or cake plate on top of the pan, then holding both together, flip them so that the curved bottom of the Bundt pan is on the top and the plate is resting on a flat surface.

S"Heat the oven to 300 degrees F.In a small bowl, combine the paprika, onion powder, 4 teaspoons salt, oregano, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and a few grinds of black pepper. Rub the mixture all over the ribs and allow it to sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours at the most.Place the ribs snugly in an oven dish with the fat side of each rib facing up. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and don\\'t be afraid to top the dish with another heavy dish to ensure the seal! Cook in the oven for 2 1/2 hours, at this point the meat should be falling off the bones. Remove the ribs from the oven and raise the temperature to 425 degrees F.Using a pair of tongs, flip and move the beef around a bit. Drizzle the honey evenly over the top of each rib. Place the ribs back in the oven, this time leaving it uncovered and cook another 10 to 15 minutes."

Add the stock, water, and vinegar, and then raise the heat to a boil, lower to a simmer, and cook for at least 1 1/2 hours. When ready, the ham hock meat will be easy to remove from the bone. Do so and make sure each serving gets a chunk of ham hock. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, remembering the ham hock and broth will add salt content.

Bring to a boil, then lower and simmer while stirring until reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes. Peel potatoes and cut lengthwise, then again making long quarters. Cut these into 1-inch pieces ending up with pie slice-shaped wedges. Place in a separate large pot of boiling water and cook for about 5 minutes. Potatoes should give a bit when poked with a fork. Drain the potatoes and arrange in a single layer in a buttered 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Pour the syrup over the potatoes; making sure it covers the potatoes. Place lemon slices on top and bake for 35 minutes, spooning syrup over potatoes twice during that time. Potatoes are done when they are tender to the fork. Remove from the oven, remove the lemon slices, and stir in pecans. Arrange the marshmallows evenly on top. Place back in the oven turning it up to 400 degrees F and cook until marshmallows puff up and turn brown, approximately 10 more minutes.'

S'Prepare the beef: Freeze the beef 30 minutes, then slice paper-thin. Whisk the brown sugar, red pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, onion, applesauce, vegetable oil, soy sauce and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl until the sugar dissolves. Add the beef and stir to coat; cover and refrigerate 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place 4 dolsot stone bowls or two 10-to-12-inch cast-iron skillets in the oven to preheat, 30 minutes.Cook the beef: Heat a cast-iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove the beef from the marinade and shake off the excess. Add the beef to the pan (you may have to do this in batches-be careful not to overcrowd the pan or the beef will steam). Cook without moving the meat, about 2 to 3 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook 1 more minute. Remove to a plate and cover with foil.Cook the veggies: Combine 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and the carrots in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, tossing, until the carrots are slightly tender but still crisp, just under 1 minute. Transfer to a large plate in a pile, leaving space for the other ingredients. Add 1 more tablespoon vegetable oil to the same pan; add the mushrooms and cook until they wilt and begin to brown slightly, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and transfer to the plate. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and the spinach to the pan. Cook, stirring, until wilted, 1 minute, then add the vinegar and cook until completely evaporated, about 30 seconds. Place the spinach on the plate with the rest of the vegetables.Assemble the bibimbap: Mix the gochujang with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl; set aside. Remove the preheated bowls or skillets from the oven to a heat-safe surface, like a wooden cutting board. Add equal amounts of hot rice to each pot. (The rice must be piping hot in order to cook the egg yolk when you stir it in.) Add equal amounts of the remaining ingredients to each bowl or skillet in piles, clockwise in order: beef, carrots, mushrooms, spinach, cabbage, scallions, bean sprouts and kimchi. Drop a dollop of the gochujang mixture in the center of each bowl or skillet, then drop the egg yolks right on top of it (1 yolk per individual bowl or 2 yolks per skillet). Serve immediately, while the rice is still sizzling, and stir to combine all of the ingredients before eating.Photograph by Ryan Liebe'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Allow to rest on the counter for up to 2 hours to come to room temperature.Heat a large oven-safe pan (such as a cast-iron skillet) over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Right as the oil begins to smoke, add the chicken, skin side down. Press gently while cooking and allow to sear until a peek beneath reveals golden brown skin, about 10 minutes. Using tongs, flip the bird over so that the skin is on top and place the pan in the oven. Be gentle with the tongs, they could rip the skin; try gripping the legs to flip. Place the pan in the oven and roast about 30 minutes.Meanwhile, in a saucepot on medium heat, add the butter and melt. Add the onions, garlic and allspice, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper. Sweat the onions for a few minutes, but do not brown. Add the brown sugar, mustard, hot sauce and vinegar. Cook a bit more to bring the flavors together, and then remove from the heat.When the chicken is around the 140 degree F mark, about 30 minutes in, remove from the oven and brush on the glaze. Return to the oven and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer reads 165 degrees F, about 15 minutes more. Let the chicken rest 10 minutes before serving. Cut off the legs, and then slice the breast off and cut into portions.'

S'To make the hash, put the chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat. Vigorously break up the sausage into bits with a potato masher or wooden spoon as it cooks. Once it resembles ground meat, add the plantain and carrots. Season with a tiny pinch of salt and some black pepper. Toss to coat everything in the fat and cook, without stirring, for a few minutes to develop color on the plantains and carrots, then toss and wait again. Cook this way until the plantains and carrots are caramelized on most sides and tender, and the chorizo is browned, about 15 minutes.Add the thyme, garlic, scallions, and jalapenos. Toss to coat and cook, stirring, until the garlic is tender and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and stir to coat.To make the gravy, sprinkle the flour over the top of the hash and stir with a wooden spoon until it disappears, then cook for a few more minutes to remove the flour taste. Add the Worcestershire sauce and orange juice. Continue to stir, allowing the juices to thicken. Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream. Garnish with the parsley and serve.'

S"Possible garnishes: 1 (8-ounce) container sour cream, 2 cups grated Cheddar, 2 cups grated pepper jack cheese, 1 large onion, diced, 4 scallions, chopped, 5 Roma tomatoes, diced, 1 bunch cilantro, leaves choppedIn a large stock pot on medium-high heat add the vegetable oil, onion and jalapeno. Sprinkle with salt and saute until both are slightly tender. Remove the casing from the chorizo and add it to the pot. Using a wooden spoon or a potato masher, break up the links until they resemble ground meat. Saute until the orange-colored oil is released and the chorizo begins to slightly crisp about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder, thyme, paprika, red pepper flakes, tomatoes, and tomato paste. Stir all ingredients well and cook until the tomato skins begin to peel back and everything is a dark reddish-brown color, about 10 minutes.Add the turkey and gravy flavoring, then using a spoon or masher, break the ground turkey apart stirring frequently while cooking. Cook until the turkey is heated through, then add chicken stock, hot sauce, cinnamon stick, and salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the cornmeal, lower to a simmer and cover. Cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to release the chili from the bottom of the pot. Remove cinnamon stick when it begins to un-curl itself and soak up a bit of moisture becoming dense and hydrated, around 40 minutes into the simmer.Meanwhile, in a heavy pot or deep-fryer heat enough oil to fill the pot at least 3-inches deep to 350 degrees F. Stack the tortillas, a few at a time, and cut into 4 strips. When the oil reaches temperature, add 5 to 6 strips at a time and fry in batches until a tap from a spoon sounds hollow and bubbles begin to form on the strips, about 1 minute for each batch. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle each batch immediately with salt. About 30 minutes before serving add the cannellini beans to the chili and stir to heat through.Transfer the chili to a large serving bowl and serve with the tortilla chips and garnishes set up like a bar.Cook\\'s Note: If making the chili a day in advance, reheat the chili and add the beans 30 minutes before serving. Store the blue corn tortilla chips in an airtight container or plastic bag."

Once all the potatoes are grated, put them into a piece of cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel and squeeze to remove the moisture. Add the potatoes to a large bowl, stir in the melted butter and season well with salt and pepper, to taste.Spray the muffin tin lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Press the grated potatoes evenly into the muffin cups being sure the potatoes go up the sides and a thin layer and covers the bottom. Bake until the top edges turn light golden brown and the potatoes are cooked through, about 35 to 40 minutes.Meanwhile, in a small bowl toss together the prosciutto with maple syrup and a few grinds of freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.Remove the potatoes from the oven and gently crack an egg into each cup. Bake until the egg whites set but the yolk remains runny, about 6 to 8 minutes.Remove from the oven and set the oven to broil. Top the eggs with grated cheese and put the maple prosciutto on another sheet tray. Broil both until cheese melts, and prosciutto crisps slightly, about 1 minute.Top the eggs with crispy prosciutto and serve immediately.'

S"In a large pot, add the potatoes, liquid smoke, garlic, a nice pinch of salt, a few grinds of pepper and water to just cover. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are fork-tender all the way through, about 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and rest the colander over the top of the empty pot to allow the heat to dry the potatoes. Once cool enough to handle but still warm, cut the larger potatoes in quarters and the others in half to make all the same general bite size. Some may not need to be cut at all. Add to a large mixing bowl.If using a gas stove, place the pepper directly over a medium flame and allow to char on one side, then rotate until the entire pepper is black and charred. If you don\\'t have a gas stove, roast the pepper on a baking sheet under the broiler or at the highest temperature of your oven. Carefully watch to rotate the pepper and char on all sides. Remove to a resealable plastic bag and close, allowing it to steam for 5 minutes to loosen the skin. Once cool enough to handle, remove the seeds and charred skin and chop the pepper. Set aside.In a large pan on medium heat, add the bacon and cook, stirring, until crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan. Add the vinegar, sugar, mustard, paprika, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper to the still-hot pan. Cook at a rolling simmer until the sugar and salt dissolve, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and toss until they soak up the vinegar mixture.Transfer the potatoes back to the large bowl. Add the red peppers, bacon, parsley and scallions and toss. Pour into a serving bowl and serve warm or cold."

S'Line a sheet tray with a wire rack. Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, separate the chicken wings into drummettes and wings, discarding the wing tip joint.In a large paper bag add the flour, 2 tablespoons of salt and about 5 grinds of black pepper. In batches, toss the chicken wings in the bag until fully coated with flour. Place the coated wings on the wire rack at room temperature until the flour appears to be invisible or soaked into the skin, about 30 minutes.Meanwhile make the coating: In a small saute pan over medium-low heat, add the paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. Toast the spices while tossing constantly to avoid burning until they are fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove the spices from the heat and allow to cool completely. Once cooled add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the sugar. Place in a bowl or paper bag for tossing.In a large pot, heat oil until a deep fry thermometer reaches 375 degrees F. Working in batches, add the chicken and fry until cooked through and crispy, 10 to 13 minutes each batch. Remove from oil and immediately add the fried wings to the bowl or paper bag filled with the coating and toss. Serve immediately.'

Lightly oil the grill grates.Grill the chicken over indirect heat, rotating occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, about 50 minutes.For the glaze: While the chicken is grilling, melt the butter in a small pot. Add the onion, allspice, a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook until the onion is tender, then add the garlic and cook until tender but not browned. Add the brown sugar, mustard, vinegar and hot sauce. Reduce about 5 minutes, then remove from the heat.When the chicken is nearly cooked through, brush on the glaze. Cover the grill and continue to cook until the glaze begins to color and the chicken is done. Cover the chicken loosely with foil and rest for 15 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute. Then cut into sections and serve.'

Stir well to combine and reserve.In a deep heavy-bottomed 12-inch pan, add about 3 inches of oil. When ready to fry the balls heat the oil to 375 degrees F.  Scoop 1 tablespoon of the potato mixture into your hand and roll it into a ball. Using the back of a 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon scoop or your finger, make an indentation in the ball leaving a pocket for the filling. Scoop a small amount of the chicken filling into the center of the potato and repeat to make a second ball. With the chicken filling facing the center, sandwich the first disk with the second and pinch to close off any seams. Roll lightly between your palms to form a ball. Continue with remaining filling and potato mixture.Lightly beat the remaining egg in a small bowl. Add the potato flakes to a shallow bowl or plate and season lightly with salt. Dip each ball into the beaten egg, then into the potato flakes. If the ball is not completely covered, put it back into the egg, then into the potato flakes for a second time. Set aside and repeat to coat all the balls. Fry the balls, in batches, until cooked through and golden, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and arrange on a serving platter to serve.'

Using a teaspoon measure, scoop the mixture and form into balls, then press into a coin shape the diameter of a quarter. Refrigerate to set up dough cookies, about 30 minutes. To make bites, dip peanut butter coins in melted chocolate then toss in graham cracker crumbs until coated, double dip and double coat if you feel dangerous. Arrange the coated coins on a wire rack and refrigerate for about 30 more minutes to set. Add the marshmallow fluff to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Remove the coins from the refrigerator and squeeze about 1 teaspoon of marshmallow fluff into the center of half of the coins. If you don\\'t have a pastry bag, use a plastic bag, fill it with fluff and cut 1 corner off and dollop that way. Then top each half with another coin to make a sandwich and place return to the refrigerator to set, about 1 hour. Options: chop coconut flakes and add them to the graham cracker crumbs to use for coating.Add puffed rice cereal into the peanut butter, butter and powdered sugar for a bit more texture and crunch."

S"Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. In a large pan with straight sides and a lid (large enough to eventually hold all the chicken nestled in 1 layer), add the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to swirl, add the chicken pieces in batches, without crowding the pan. Cook until golden brown, flipping and browning on all sides. The purpose isn\\'t to fully cook them here, just to get color. Remove the chicken to a plate.Immediately add the tomatoes to the pan and allow them to roast while resting for a few minutes, then shake the pan and stir to get another side of the tomatoes roasting on the bottom of the pan. Cook like this until the tomatoes are charred and begin to break apart and create a sauce, about 8 minutes.Add the black olives, chile flakes and garlic to the tomatoes. Then, nestle the chicken pieces back into the pan. Add enough chicken stock so the chicken is almost but not completely covered by the liquid (leave about 1/2 inch). Cover and lower to a simmer. Cook until the check of a garlic clove reveals it to be tender, or the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.Bring the liquid in the pan back to a boil. Add the pasta and spinach and cook until the pasta is al dente, about 5 minutes (according to the timing on the package). Remove the pasta to serving plates or bowls. Pour the chicken and spinach sauce over the pasta and serve with a spritz of lemon."

Remove to a wire rack and allow to rest until the flour soaks into the skin, about 15 minutes. Repeat the process for 2 dry coats. After the second resting period, the wings are ready to fry.In a deep fryer or deep heavy pot, add enough oil to fill to about 4 inches. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Add the wings in batches to keep the temperature and fry each batch 12 minutes. Remove the wings to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle immediately with a pinch of salt.In batches, add a bit of the glaze to a large bowl and a few wings, then toss them to coat.

S"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter an 8-by-8-inch baking dish and set aside.For the casserole: Fill a large pot with water. Add the garlic and a small handful of salt. Bring to a boil and add the potatoes. Cook until fork tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the potatoes and garlic with a slotted spoon to a sieve to let drain. To the same water, add the green beans. Bring back to a boil if needed, then simmer until the green beans are bright and tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove to a sieve.In a saute pan on medium heat, add the olive oil, onions, serrano chile and thyme. Season with a pinch of salt, a grind or 2 of pepper and paprika. Cook until the onions are tender, and then add the mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce, and season again with salt and pepper. Cook until the mushrooms release some of their moisture and become tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the thyme sprigs and slowly stir in the heavy cream. Raise the heat until things begin to bubble. Cook at this temperature, while stirring, until the cream thickens a bit, 6 to 8 minutes. Once thickened, turn off the heat and stir in the crema.In one large bowl, add the potatoes. In another large bowl, add the green beans. Add the jalapenos to the potatoes. Then, add three-quarters of the mushroom mixture to the potatoes and the rest to the green beans. Divide the cheese the same way into both bowls. Mash the potatoes until combined. Press into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Stir the green beans until combined, and spread evenly over the top.For the topping: Rinse the potato peels and dry as much as possible with paper towels. In a bowl, add the potato strips, sage, thyme, paprika and olive oil. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of pepper. Toss and sprinkle evenly over the top of the green beans. Bake until the potatoes brown and begin to crisp on the edges, about 30 minutes.Cook\\'s Note: To prepare in advance, build casserole, but leave off the topping and refrigerate. Refrigerate the reserved potato peels already cut into strips in a container with water. Before baking, rest the casserole at room temperature for about 1 hour, and then make the topping and bake as instructed."

S"For the batter: In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, thyme, salt, black pepper, ground mustard,  cayenne pepper, nutmeg and lemon zest. Gradually whisk in the flour to make a thick, tight batter. Add more flour by the spoonful until the proper texture is met (this should feel like it won\\'t drip through a colander whole, but can be pressed through and remain stringy, not doughy).Boil the spaetzle: Fill a double boiler halfway with water and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and place a colander over the pot. Add a heaping cup of spaetzle batter at a time to the colander and, with a rubber spatula, press the batter through the holes into the boiling water. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the colander between pressings and stir the spaetzle into the water so the next group of batter doesn\\'t stick to the one before it. The spaetzle is cooked when it floats to the top. Remove with a fine mesh sieve and strain to remove as much water as possible (shake it!).Pan fry the spaetzle: In a large pan on medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Add the butter to the remaining bacon fat in the pan and allow it to melt. Then add the boiled spaetzle to the pan to saute. Water and oil can produce splattering, be careful! Allow the spaetzle to build a golden crust, and then toss and cook until it\\'s mostly golden all over, but still tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan and toss. Sprinkle with lemon juice, taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Serve warm."

In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture, whisking the batter until just combined. In a medium bowl or wide baking dish, add onion rings and dust with flour. Toss gently to uniformly coat rings, and shake off excess flour. Working in batches, dip floured onion rings into the batter, making sure they are thoroughly coated, then carefully add to the preheated oil. Cook until deep golden, flipping halfway through if necessary, about 2 minutes. Remove the onion rings to a paper towel-lined plate and season immediately with salt.

Using an ice cream scoop, make 1 ball of ice cream (if you use your hands to make it perfect, do it fast!) and quickly roll it in the cereal coating. Place it on the baking sheet in the freezer and repeat for the remaining balls. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.Remove the egg wash from the fridge and, one by one, dunk and coat each ball in it. Then roll again in the cereal coating, returning each ball to the freezer immediately after rolling in the cereal coating. Freeze this time about 30 minutes.Repeat the egg wash and cereal coating again, freezing the final time a full 2 hours or overnight. (Perfect to prep the day before!)Fill a heavy pot or deep fryer about halfway with oil and bring to 375 degrees F. Drop a few ice cream balls in directly from the freezer and cook golden brown, about 1 minute. Timing depends on the batch and ball size, so watch the pot! Roll on a paper-towel-lined plate to quickly remove any excess oil. Serve immediately after frying.'

S"Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add in the onion, green pepper and garlic. Saute for 3 minutes to soften the vegetables. Then, add the tomato paste and cumin and cook until a deep reddish-brown color is achieved. Stir in the tomatoes and cook until they become tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in the broth and the beans, bring everything to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the gravy thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. (Chef\\'s Note: The consistency will be soupy.) Adjust the seasonings with salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste.For the faux-fongo:Heat 2-inches of vegetable oil in a deep skillet to 360 degrees F.Cut the plantains into 2-inch pieces, then remove their skins with a knife by cutting through a corner of the flesh along the length of the slice to get a lead, then peel the fruit. Fry the plantains, in batches, in the oil until when tapped with a metal spoon it sounds hard, about 8 minutes. Transfer the pieces to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with remaining plantains.Sandwich the plantains between parchment paper and, using a small plate or a coffee mug, press them so they are about 1/2-inch thick. Fry the plantains again at 360 degrees F until crisp and golden, then transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to cool slightly.Add the fried plantains to a food processor. Combine them with the bacon, bacon fat, and garlic, then pulse until everything is blended, but still chunky. (Chef\\'s Note: The texture should be a mix of crunchy, moist and tender.) Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt, if needed.To serve, spoon in enough Faux-Fongo to fill a 6-ounce ramekin and press the mixture down well. Invert the portion onto a plate and ladle the gravy around it. Repeat with remaining 3 servings."

S'For the steaks: On a plate, sprinkle the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper, and drizzle with the olive oil. Lay out enough plastic wrap to cover each steak. Tightly wrap the steaks individually with a piece of rosemary on both sides of each steak. Rest at room temperature 2 hours.For the butter: In the meantime, in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter together with the paprika and 1 teaspoon salt.  Stir to dissolve the salt, then add the rosemary and garlic. Continue cooking on low until the butter is fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. If the butter begins to brown, turn the heat down.  Remove from the heat, discard the rosemary and skim off any foam. Pour into a container and refrigerate until solid.Preheat a grill or grill pan to high heat. Remove the steaks from the plastic wrap and discard the rosemary. Place the steaks on the grill and cook until the internal temperature reaches 125 degrees F, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the steaks to a serving platter and top each with a generous scoop of the compound butter. Loosely cover the steaks with a foil tent and allow to rest for 10 minutes, so the carryover cooking brings the final internal temperature up to 130 degrees F (medium rare, closer to rare) before serving.'

Set aside.Sear the beef: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat until it begins to swirl. Add the beef cubes and sprinkle with half of the seasoning blend. Cook, stirring intermittently, until the beef is browned on all sides but not cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove the beef chunks with a slotted spoon and set on a plateBuild the flavor: Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions, bell pepper, garlic, tomato paste and hot sauce. Cook, stirring, until everything turns dark reddish brown, about 10 minutes.Complete the chili: Add the ground beef and sprinkle with the remaining half of the seasoning blend. Cook, stirring, until the beef is browned, then add the reserved beef chunks back to the pot along with the cornmeal, stock, wine and squash. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the chili is thick and the liquid reduced, 40 to 50 minutes. Taste and season with another pinch of salt if needed, but the seasoning blend you\\'ve made should have this tasting perfect for you. If using cinnamon, add the stick 20 minutes before the chili is done, then remove before serving. Serve warm."

S'Special equipment: 10-inch round cake panPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease the sides and bottom of a 10-inch round cake pan with butter.For the filling: In a bowl, add the brown sugar, pecans, diced apple, lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and a pinch of salt. Stir until combined.In a small pot, melt the 2 tablespoons butter with a pinch of salt. Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Flatten the puff pastry and roll with a rolling pin to even out and seal the perforations, if any. Brush the butter all over the puff pastry, leaving a 1-inch border at one of the shorter ends. Sprinkle the apple-cinnamon mixture evenly over the pastry sheet, being careful to leave that 1-inch border. Starting from the end furthest from the edge without any filling, begin to tightly roll the pastry. Tuck and press as you go, keeping the log as even as possible. When the edge is reached, roll the pastry onto itself and press firmly, even pinching, to seal. Using a serrated knife, trim the edges and gently cut 6 equal slices from each log. Repeat with the second puff pastry sheet to make 12 pieces total.Place the slices spiral side up in the prepared cake pan. Start around the edges and fill in the center. Bake until the pastry is cooked through and golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.Meanwhile, for the glaze: In a small pot, add the butter and melt over low heat. Add the vanilla extract and lemon juice and begin whisking in the powdered sugar in 1/4 cup increments. Continue adding and whisking between additions until the glaze thickens. Season with a pinch of salt, then remove from the heat.Remove the buns from the oven and pour the glaze over the top. Let rest about 5 minutes before serving. Serve warm.'

Rinse each artichoke and trim 1/2-inch off of the stalk. Trim 1-inch off the top of each artichoke. Then cut each artichoke in half, from stalk to tip, and remove the choke with a spoon. Remove the tough outer leaves and trim the outside of the stalk with a paring knife. Add the prepped artichokes to the bowl of lemon water to keep from browning.Slice the remaining lemon. In a baking dish large enough to place the artichokes in 1 even layer, place the slices in the dish to form a bed for the artichokes. In the center of each artichoke, add a garlic half and drizzle with half the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then place cut side down on top of the lemon slices. Pour the chicken stock around the sides, drizzle the remaining olive oil over the tops of the artichokes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover and firmly seal with aluminum foil.

Season with salt.Roll out enough aluminum foil to surround the ham and place the ham in the center of the foil. Peel back the layers of the ham and place a sprig of thyme between every other layer of the spirals. Pour half of the glaze over the ham allowing it to sink into the slices. Tightly wrap the ham in the foil and place on a rack in a roasting pan. Fill the pan with an inch of water and roast in the oven until the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F, about 20 minutes per pound.Pour the remaining half of the glaze in a small saucepot on medium heat and bring to a simmer. Whisk until small bubbles appear all over, then turn off the heat. The glaze will thicken as it rests.Raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F.Remove the ham from the oven. Using caution and tongs to help, peel back the aluminum foil from the top, leaving the aluminum foil on the sides and underneath the ham to catch the glaze and juices. Slather the remaining glaze all over the top of the ham and place back in the oven uncovered for 15 more minutes. Remove and let rest before slicing.'

S'Patties: In a large bowl, gently but thoroughly combine all ingredients. Form into 4 equal-sized thin patties roughly the size of the bread you will be using or in the case of the naan, 1/2 the bread size. Cover the patties with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Onions: In a medium saute pan on medium heat melt the butter with the oil. Add the onion and season with a pinch of salt and a couple of grinds of pepper, to taste. Saute until the onions are caramelized, about 35 minutes, and set aside.Preheat a griddle with 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Griddle the patties on the on both sides until crispy on the edges and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and wipe the griddle. Assemble the sandwiches by layering each bread 1/2 with a slice of cheese, a patty, another slice of cheese, onions, and the other bread 1/2, in that order. Brush or add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the griddle and put the sandwiches on the griddle. Press on the sandwich with a spatula to help toast evenly and hold the sandwich together. Cook until the cheese is melted and the bread is toasted, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve immediately with ketchup, for dipping.'

S'For the black bean patties: Mash the beans in a large bowl, leaving some of the bean texture. Stir in the corn, oatmeal, taco seasoning and garlic. Stir to combine, taste and then season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Fold in the egg. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 15 minutes to hydrate the oats.In a large nonstick pan, heat the oil on medium heat. When the oil begins to swirl a bit, use an ice cream scoop to portion the black bean mixture equally into 4 balls. Drop them into the pan, then press each into a patty shape with a spatula. Cook on one side until golden and a bit crisp, about 8 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until slightly crisped, 5 to 8 minutes more. Remove to individual serving plates.For the cream sauce: In a double boiler with the water boiling but not touching the pot above, add a piece of the butter, the yolks, lime juice, a splash of water and a pinch of salt. Whisk continuously while the butter melts, then add another piece of butter, working it in until it melts. Continue adding the butter pieces one at a time, whisking and melting between additions, until all the pieces are whisked in. Taste and adjust with salt if needed. Keep warm on the double boiler.Divide the ham into 4 servings and place a portion on top of each black bean patty. Top each with an egg, drizzle over the sauce and sprinkle with pickles. Sprinkle the plate with cilantro and tomatoes. Serve warm.'

That\\'s easy.Heat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Remove the pork chops from the bag and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on the grill and cook until the pork chop releases from the grill, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for another 3 minutes. If using a grill pan, be sure to do in batches so you don\\'t steam the chops. And don\\'t worry if you have neither; you can do this in a pan. See, easy!"

S"Make the salad: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brush a baking sheet with the olive oiland arrange the prosciutto in a single layer. Bake until the fat is rendered and the prosciutto is crisp, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the prosciutto to a rack and let cool completely, then break into pieces and set aside.Meanwhile, fill a large pot with cold water; add the potatoes and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until the potatoes are just fork-tender, about 15 minutes. (The potatoes will continue to cook when you remove them from the water, and you don\\'t want a mushy potato salad!) Drain in a colander, then place the colander over the now-empty pot, off the heat, to allow the excess moisture to evaporate from the potatoes.Make the dressing: In a large bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, scallions, sugar, paprika, mustard and vinegar. Taste and then season with salt and a few grinds of pepper.Add the potatoes to the bowl with the dressing and gently toss. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Sprinkle the crispy prosciutto on top before serving.Photograph by Anna Williams"

S"For the chicken and marinade: Gently press each thigh between 2 pieces of plastic wrap to flatten (do this with a rolling pin, it\\'s less brutal than pounding). Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag with the oil, cumin and lime zest and juice. Seal the bag and squish everything around until everything is coated by everything. Rest on the counter for 1 hour.For the spread: In a medium bowl, add the cilantro, bacon, avocado, tomatoes and hot sauce if using. Fold to combine gently so the tomatoes don\\'t get mashed, then taste and season with a pinch of salt if needed. Cover by placing plastic wrap directly on the top of the spread and refrigerate until using.For the caramelized onions: In a large pot on low heat (or in a pot over the indirect heat area of a grill), add the onions, olive oil, butter, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring every other minute or so, until the onions are tender and a deep golden brown, about 30 minutes.Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.Remove the chicken from the bag, shaking off excess marinade. Place the chicken over the direct heat of the grill (or on the grill pan). Once the chicken releases from the grill and can be flipped, flip it to the indirect heat side of the grill (or lower the heat on the grill pan) and grill until cooked through, just 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil for 10 minutes. Roughly chop the chicken.To assemble and serve. Build each burger in this order, starting at the bottom with: the bottom bun, slice of cheese, big scoop of chicken and caramelized onions and the top roll slathered with tons of avocado spread."

S'For the chocolate apple pie cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Use the butter to grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch cake pan or springform pan. Cut out a circle of parchment paper to fit the pan and place it on the bottom.In a large bowl, prepare the cake batter as instructed on the box. Pour 1 cup of the batter into the cake pan and spread it out. Add the apple pie on top of the cake batter, then pour the rest of the cake batter over the top and around the sides. Spread it to make sure there are no air pockets.Bake the cake until a toothpick inserted in the center and around the edges comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, turn the cake out onto the rack, peel off the parchment paper and allow to cool completely.For the ganache: Pour the chocolate chips into a medium bowl. In a small pot on medium heat, add the heavy cream, rum and a pinch of salt and whisk until warm. Pour over the bowl of chips and allow to sit and soak in for 2 minutes. Whisk to melt the chocolate completely.Place the cake on a serving platter, pour the ganache in the center and spread gently outward over the edges. Sprinkle with the pecans and serve.'
