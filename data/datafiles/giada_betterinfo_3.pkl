S'Line a heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir the sugar, water, light corn syrup, and dark corn syrup in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to high and boil without stirring until a candy thermometer registers 260 degrees F, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Mix in the hazelnuts, butter, and salt (the mixture will be thick and nutty), and cook until the thermometer registers 295 degrees F, stirring constantly, about 15 minutes. Quickly stir in the baking soda. Immediately pour the caramel onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading it as thinly as possible. Let stand until hard.Break the brittle into pieces and store in an airtight container at room temperature. If desired, serve over your favorite ice cream.'

Let the bread soak for 10 minutes, turning once.For the syrup: Peel the orange and remove the white pith. Using a paring knife, cut along the membrane on both sides of each segment. Free the segments and place in a small saucepan. Add the sugar, water, orange liqueur or orange juice, if using, star anise, and cinnamon stick. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved. Simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the syrup to cool, about 20 minutes. Remove the star anise pods and cinnamon stick and discard.Preheat a griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and add the butter. Using a spatula, remove the bread slices from the egg mixture, allowing any excess liquid to drain. Cook until golden, about 3 minutes each side. Place on 4 serving plates and drizzle with the orange syrup and orange segments. In a small bowl, toss the blueberries and mint together and spoon on top of the French toast.

Drizzle the oil over the grill pan. Drizzle the peach halves with the balsamic vinegar, then grill flat-side down until softened and grill-marked, 3 to 4 minutes. Slice the peaches into wedges and arrange in a circle over the crust, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round. Pleat the edge of the pastry and pinch to seal any cracks in the dough.Combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan and cook without stirring until it has become a deep amber color, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the butter, lemon juice and salt. Immediately pour the caramel over the peach slices.Bake the crostata until golden, 20 to 25 minutes.For the thyme whipped cream: Meanwhile, combine the heavy cream, sugar, vanilla and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Whip until the cream has soft peaks, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in the thyme.Let the crostata cool for 15 minutes to let the caramel settle, then cut into wedges and serve with a dollop of thyme whipped cream.'

S'To make the ravioli: in a medium bowl, stir together the turkey, cranberry sauce, cheese, bread crumbs, parsley, egg, salt, and pepper. Place 10 wonton wrappers on a work surface. Brush lightly with water using a pastry brush. Place 1 tablespoon of the turkey mixture on each of the wonton wrappers. Top with another wonton wrapper. Push out any air bubbles and press the edges tightly to seal. To make the gravy: in a medium, heavy skillet, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and stir until cooked, about 1 minute. Slowly add the chicken broth, stirring quickly to avoid lumps. Add the cream, parley, salt, and pepper and cook, without boiling, for 2 minutes, stirring often. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the ravioli and cook until tender but still firm to the bite and the turkey is cooked, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Drain the ravioli into the gravy and stir to coat. Serve immediately in individual dishes, drizzled with the remaining gravy.'

S'Cinnamon sugar: In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, cinnamon and espresso powder. Set aside.Churros: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and dust liberally with flour. Set aside. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven, combine the water, butter, sugar, espresso powder, and salt over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and, using a wooden spoon, stir in the 1 cup of flour all at once. Return the pan to low heat and stir continuously until the mixture forms a thick dough, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. With the machine running on medium speed, slowly add the eggs. Continue to beat until the eggs are fully incorporated and the dough is thick, about 4 minutes. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe the dough onto the prepared baking sheet in 4-inch long logs. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about 1/3 of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. (If you dont have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in a couple of minutes.) Using a thin metal spatula, transfer the dough, 4 pieces at a time, into the hot oil, and fry until dark-golden and crispy, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and roll in the cinnamon-espresso sugar while still hot. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.'

Whisk until just combined \\u2014 a few small lumps left is just fine.Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil to the pan and swirl to coat evenly. Add about 2 cups of batter to the pan to make the first pancake. Cook for 6 minutes on the first side, adjusting the heat as needed to cook gently without burning. When small bubbles start to burst on the surface, sprinkle over a few chocolate chips and slide the pancake onto a flat plate. Place the pan over the plate and flip the pancake back into the pan. Cook for an additional 2 minutes, then remove the pancake to a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Continue with the remaining batter, going down by about 1/2 cup or 1/4 cup for each pancake. When the pancakes get small enough, feel free to simply flip with a spatula. You should end up with about 8 pancakes.Place the cream cheese, butter, sugar, peppermint extract, salt and milk in a large bowl. Beat with a handheld mixer on medium speed until fully combined and light and fluffy, 3 minutes. Set aside.Place the largest pancake on a flat cake stand. Spread some of the frosting over the top of the pancake, leaving a 1/3-inch border on the outside. Sprinkle with some of the crushed candy canes. Continue stacking the pancakes with the frosting and the candy canes, going down in size as you stack. Insert a long skewer through the center of the cake to hold the layers in place. Trim the skewer so that the top is flush with the top of the cake, and cover with more frosting. Decorate with mini meringue cookies on top if desired.'

S'In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil. Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Place broccoli into pot and cook for two minutes. You just want to parboil the broccoli at this point since you will saute it later on. Using a spider strainer, remove broccoli from pot and shock it in a bowl of ice water. When broccoli is completely cool, place it in a colander and allow to drain. Refresh the bowl of ice water. Bring the water back to a boil. Add green beans and cook for 4 minutes. Like the broccoli, you just want to parboil the green beans. Remove green beans from pot with spider strainer and add to ice water. When green beans are completely cool, add them to the colander and allow to drain.In a large saute pan, heat olive oil. When almost smoking, add the garlic and saute for about 45 seconds. When the garlic starts to brown, remove immediately and discard. Overcooking the garlic will impart a very bitter taste to the dish. Add the red pepper flakes, broccoli and green beans to the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately. '

Always stirring, gradually add the milk and continue to whisk until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Simmer until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. This will take approximately 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in nutmeg, 1/2 cup fontina, prosciutto and season with salt and white pepper. Set aside.In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water. Add the rigatoni and cook for about 5 minutes. Since you will be cooking the pasta a second time in the oven, you want to make sure the inside is still hard. Drain in a colander. Return pasta to the pot and pour in bechamel sauce. Using a wooden spoon, mix well until all the pasta is coated with the sauce.Into a greased 13 by 9-inch baking dish, pour the pasta with cream sauce. Smooth out top and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup fontina. Dot the top with diced butter and bake in oven for 25 minutes or until bubbling and the top is golden brown.'

S"Place 1/4 cup of chocolate chips in a small bowl. Place the bowl over a small pan of barely simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted and smooth, about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.Gently squeeze the sides of an apricot together until 3/4-inch thick. Using a wooden skewer, make a hole through the center of the side of the apricot and thread a piece of licorice through the hole. Repeat twice more on either side of the first hole. Gently flatten out the apricot to its original shape. Dip the blunt end of the skewer in the melted chocolate and place a very small dab of chocolate onto the flat side of 2 chocolate chips. Place the chocolate chips side-by-side on the end of the apricot to form 2 eyes. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Allow the melted chocolate to harden, about 15 minutes, and serve.Cook\\'s Note: The bugs can also be made using dried prunes. Use red licorice lace for the legs and white chocolate chips for the eyes."

S"Using an electric mixer, beat the butter or shortening and sugar in a large bowl until fluffy. Beat in the egg and the brandy. Beat in the salt. Add the flour and beat until blended. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until a soft dough forms. Form the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape the dough pieces into balls. Wrap the dough balls with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes. Working with 1 dough ball at a time, roll the dough ball into a 12-inch diameter round (the dough should be very thin and almost transparent). Using a fluted pastry cutter, trim the edges to form a square shape. Cut the dough into 1-inch strips. Cut each strip in half crosswise to form 5-inch-long strips. Gently stretch the strip gently so that you have enough dough to tie a bow. Repeat with remaining dough strips. Gather the dough scraps, then reroll and cut them to make additional bowtie pastries.Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large heavy frying pan over medium heat to 375 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the pastries until they puff and become golden, turning once, about 2 minutes total. Using tongs, transfer the pastries to the paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain the excess oil. While still hot, dust the pastries generously with confectioners\\' sugar and serve.The pastries can be made 2 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature."

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S"For the cake: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray an 11- by 8-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the baking sheet allowing the excess to fall over the sides. Spray the parchment paper with the cooking spray. Set aside.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside.In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Beat in the eggs, one at a time until smooth. Add the mascarpone cheese, orange juice and zest. Mix until well combined. Gradually add the flour mixture until combined.Scrape the batter into the prepared baking sheet, spreading the batter to the edges. Bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Using the excess parchment to lift, carefully remove the cake from the baking sheet and cool completely on a wire rack for about 30 minutes.For the frosting: While the cake is cooling, combine the confectioners\\' sugar, milk, vanilla extract and butter in a medium bowl. Using an electric hand mixer, combine the ingredients until smooth, adding more milk if needed (the frosting should be stiff). Gradually add the orange food coloring until desired color.Cut the cooled cake in half. Using a serrated knife, trim the top layer of cake halves to make a flat surface. Spread the frosting over one half of the cake. Top with the other cake half. Refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour until the frosting has set.For the chocolate: Combine the chocolate and safflower oil in a small bowl and place over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth.Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Cut the cake into 1 1/4-inch squares. Insert a popsicle stick into the end of each cake square. Dip the cake squares into the melted chocolate, shaking off any excess chocolate. Decorate with sprinkles and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the rest of the cake squares. Refrigerate the pops until the chocolate has set, 1 to 2 hours."

If not frying immediately, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and reserve in the refrigerator.Pour enough oil into a large frying pan to reach a depth of 2 inches. Heat over medium heat until the oil registers 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Using a small ice cream scoop or two small spoons, scoop out 1 tablespoon of dough and push two of the frozen candies into its center. Smooth the dough over the candies to fully encase them. Carefully drop the filled dough into the hot oil. Fry in batches, turning the zeppole once or twice, until they are golden and puffed up, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and the cinnamon in a small bowl. Toss the fried zeppole in the cinnamon-sugar. Arrange on a platter and serve immediately.'

Insert a lollipop stick into each fig ball.Place the chocolate chips and 1 teaspoon of the oil in a medium bowl. Place the bowl over a small saucepan of barely simmering water and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes.Drop the fig balls into the melted chocolate and, using a fork, roll to coat evenly. Remove the fig balls, allowing any excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl, and place on the baking sheet. Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until the chocolate has set.Using a small pair of scissors, cut the fruit leather into small squares to make noses for the cats and triangles for the ears. Dip the ends of the ears in the leftover dark chocolate and stick them on the cats. Repeat with the squares for the noses.Place the white chocolate and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of the oil in a medium bowl. Place the bowl over a small saucepan of barely simmering water and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer the chocolate to a piping bag fitted with a small plain tip. Pipe eyes and whiskers on the cats. Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.'

S'To make the turkey: Position the rack in the lowest third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Rinse the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels. Place the turkey on a rack set inside a large roasting pan. Place the orange and lemon wedges, onion, and 2 sprigs of each fresh herb in the main turkey cavity. Tie the legs together to hold the shape of the turkey. Stir 2 tablespoons of butter, the herbes de Provence, oil, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of each the salt and pepper in a small saucepan over medium heat just until the butter melts. Rub the butter mixture all over the turkey and between the turkey breast meat and skin. Place the turkey neck and giblets in roasting pan. (Recipe can be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before roasting.)Cover the turkey breast with foil. Roast for 20 minutes. Pour 3 cups of broth into the pan and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining sprigs of fresh herbs to the pan. Roast the turkey for 40 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Remove the foil from the turkey; pour 1 more cup of broth into the pan. Continue roasting the turkey until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F to 175 degrees F or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with a skewer, basting occasionally with pan juices, about 1 hour and 30 minutes longer. Transfer the turkey to a platter and tent with foil. Let stand 30 minutes while preparing the gravy. To make the gravy: Strain the turkey pan juices from the roasting pan through a sieve and into a 4-cup glass measuring cup; discard the solids. Spoon off the fat from atop the pan juices. Add enough chicken broth, about 1 to 2 cups, to the pan juices to measure 4 cups total. Melt the remaining butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the broth. Simmer until the gravy thickens slightly, whisking often, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the turkey with the gravy.'

Turn off the heat and spread the onions evenly over the bottom of the pan, using a rubber spatula.Place the ricotta in a small bowl. Season with 1/8 teaspoon each kosher salt and black pepper. Dollop the ricotta over the onions in 8 to 10 places. Using a fork, prick the puff pasty a few times evenly. Place the puff pastry over the top of the filling, pressing down gently to make sure the dough is touching the ricotta and onions.Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with a plate slightly larger than the skillet. Invert the crostata onto the plate, replacing any onions that may have stuck to the pan. Set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile, in a small bowl, dress the arugula with the lemon juice. Sprinkle the arugula over the cooled crostata and nestle the tomatoes into the onions.

S"*Cook\\'s Note: For easier shredding, freeze the fontina cheese for 15 minutes.Preheat a gas or charcoal grill with a cover. (The pizzettes can also be baked in the oven. Place an oven rack in the upper 1/3 of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Bake the pizzettes on a cornmeal-dusted baking sheet until the crust is golden, 12 to 14 minutes.)Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Set aside. Using a mandoline slicer, slice the apples and beets into 1/16 to 1/8-inch thick slices. Set aside.On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 13-inch diameter circle. Using a 4-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 6 circles of dough and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Divide the fontina and sprinkle on top of each circle of dough. Divide the apple and beet slices and place on top. Add the goat cheese and sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Drizzle with olive oil and place on the grill over low, indirect heat. Cover the grill and cook until the crust is crisp and golden and the cheese begins to melt, 8 to 10 minutes."

Line a baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper sprayed with vegetable cooking spray.Unroll the pie crust out on a work surface. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 8 disks of pastry. Arrange the pastry disks on the prepared baking sheet. Using the tines of a fork, prick the pastry all over. Bake until brown and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes.Slice the bottom of the apples to create an even surface for cutting. Slice each apple into 6 (1/2-inch) slices. Cut each apple slice in half and remove any seeds or pieces of core. In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Add the apple slices and toss until coated. Shake off any excess mixture. Arrange the apple slices on the same baking sheet in a single layer. Bake until dark brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes.In a medium bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat the cream until thick, about 1 minute. Add the powdered sugar and continue to beat until the cream is very thick.To assemble the pies: Place the pastry disks on a work surface. Divide the cooked apple slices among 4 of the disks. Dollop about 2 tablespoons of the cream on top of the apples and cover with the remaining disks.Transfer the apple pies to dessert plates, dust with cinnamon and serve immediately.'

S'For the jam: Set a sieve over a medium bowl. Trim the ends from the oranges, then cut away the peel and pith. Working over the bowl to catch the juice, cut along the membrane on both sides of each orange segment with a paring knife and let the segments drop into the sieve. Squeeze the juice from the leftover membranes into the bowl. Remove the segments from the grapefruits in the same manner, and squeeze the juices from the leftover membranes into the bowl. Remove the segments from 1 lemon and squeeze the juice from the leftover membranes into the bowl. Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon into the bowl.Place the citrus segments, juices, sugar and arrowroot in a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then refrigerate for 30 minutes.For the crust: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt and lemon zest. Pulse until blended. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Combine the ice water and almond extract. With the machine running, gradually add the water mixture and process until moist clumps form. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and form into a ball. Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for 30 minutes.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.On a large sheet of parchment paper, roll out the dough into a 10-inch round. Slide the dough and parchment onto a large, heavy baking sheet. Fold in the edge of the dough to make a border, forming an 8 to 9-inch round. Pleat the edge loosely and pinch to seal any cracks in the dough. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork.Bake until the crust is golden, about 40 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slide a metal spatula under the crust and remove the parchment. Let cool completely.For the topping: In a small bowl, mix together the mascarpone cheese, sugar, vanilla and the orange and lemon zests until smooth.Spread the mascarpone topping over the cooled crust, then spoon the citrus jam on top. Cut into wedges and serve.'

S'For the porchetta: The day before roasting, begin by chopping 1/2 teaspoon of the fennel seeds. Mix the chopped fennel seeds together with 1 1/4 teaspoons of the salt and the orange zest. Rub both sides of the turkey with the salt mixture. Place the turkey breast in a gallon plastic storage bag and refrigerate overnight.The day of roasting, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the turkey breast from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature for 20 minutes before cooking.Meanwhile, in a 12-inch, ovenproof saute pan, toast the panko over medium heat, stirring with a rubber spatula, until golden brown. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the remaining 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, the red pepper flakes and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Set aside.To the same pan over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the rosemary, apples, fennel, shallots and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Saute until the fennel softens, about 5 minutes. Add to the bowl with the panko and toss to combine. Wipe out the saute pan and reserve to sear the turkey.Place the butterflied turkey breast, opened, in front of you. Spread the filling evenly over the turkey. Roll up the turkey to maintain the shape. Tie with twine in four spots about 2 inches apart.Place the saute pan over medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place the turkey breast in the hot pan and sear on all sides until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer placed in the thickest part of the breast reads 155 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Remove to a cutting board, tent with foil and allow the porchetta to rest for 15 minute before slicing.For the gravy: While the porchetta is resting, prepare the gravy. Over medium-high heat, add the sage sprig to the drippings that are left in the turkey pan. Add the flour and whisk to form a smooth paste. If there are not enough pan drippings to make the paste, add a tablespoon of olive oil. Cook this over medium-high heat until it is a medium amber color, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the white wine and continue whisking for 1 minute more. Add the chicken broth, salt and pepper and whisk until smooth. Bring the gravy to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain the gravy just before serving alongside the porchetta.'

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch glass pie plate with cooking sprayHeat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Add the anchovies, garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the escarole and salt to the pan, cover and cook until wilted. Add the wine and cook for 1 minute. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Let the escarole cool slightly, then place it in a large kitchen towel and gently ring out excess moisture. Transfer the greens to the bowl of a food processor. Add the olives, the lemon zest and juice, and the feta and process until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Add the currants and pulse to combine.Unroll the pie crusts. Use one to line a 9-inch pie pan, pressing it gently into the pan so there are no air bubbles and leaving some overhang around the edges. Brush the crust with the beaten egg, then spoon in the filling and distribute evenly. Cover with the second pie crust, tucking in and crimping the edges with your fingers or the tines of a fork. Cut three slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush the pie with the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil and bake until golden brown and cooked through, about 40 minutes. Allow the pie to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a small saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups of the milk, the sugar, and vanilla. Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle the gelatin over the remaining 1/2 cup cold milk and let dissolve for 2 minutes. Combine the cold milk and gelatin with the hot milk and sugar. Stir to dissolve the gelatin, about 5 minutes. (Heat the milk gently if the gelatin is not dissolving easily.) When the gelatin is dissolved combine the eggs with the warm milk, whisking constantly to avoid scrambling the eggs. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a large measuring cup or small pitcher.Meanwhile, melt the chocolate over a double boiler. When the chocolate is melted gradually combine the milk and egg mixture with the melted chocolate, stirring between each addition to create a smooth chocolate mixture.Pour the mixture into a buttered 2-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle the top with the almonds. Place the casserole dish in a larger dish or roasting pan. Add hot water to the outer pan until the water comes halfway up the sides of the baking dish. Bake until the sides are firm and the center is jiggles slightly, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 30 minutes.Just before serving, whip the cream to soft peaks in a medium bowl using a whisk or electric hand mixer. Add the sugar and almond liqueur and whip to combine. Spoon the sformato into individual serving bowls and dollop the top with the almond liqueur whip cream.'

S'For the soup: In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, shallots, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the carrots are softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the chicken broth, orange juice, basil, maple syrup, tomato paste and the tomatoes (with juice). Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.Using an immersion blender or food processor, puree the soup until smooth. Cool the soup to room temperature until ready to serve, about 1 hour. Season the soup with salt and pepper.For the yogurt topping: In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, maple syrup and orange zest until smooth.Ladle the soup into chilled bowls and top with a dollop of the yogurt mixture.When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.'

Drizzle the burgers with oil. Cook on low heat until cooked through, for 10 minutes on each side. The burgers are also ready when a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees F when inserted into the side of the burgers. Allow the burgers to rest for 10 minutes.Place the burgers on buns and top with chutney. Serve with lettuce leaves and sliced tomatoes if desired.Cook\\'s Note: The burgers can also be cooked over low heat for 10 minutes on each side in a nonstick skillet or on a nonstick griddle."

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture forms a coarse meal. With the food processor running, gradually add the iced water until the mixture forms a ball. Add extra water 1 teaspoon at a time, if the mixture is too thick. Form the dough into an 8-by-3-inch rectangle and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.Roll the dough into a 14-by-10-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Place the dough in the tart pan and trim any excess dough from the top of the pan. Reserve the excess dough. Prick the dough all over, using the tines of a fork. Bake until the crust is light golden, about 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.For the filling: Combine the butter, almond paste, eggs, flour, agave and almond extract in a food processor. Blend until smooth. Spread the filling evenly over the cooled crust, using a spatula.In a medium bowl, toss the raspberries and agave together until coated. Gently press the raspberries into the filling in a single layer.On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the excess dough into an 8-inch circle, about 1/8-to-1/4-inch thick. Cut out pieces of dough using a cookie cutter and place randomly on top of the raspberries. Brush with the beaten egg. Bake until the filling is slightly puffed and the pastry is golden, about 25 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour.

S'For the pesto: Combine the piquillo peppers, macadamia nuts, salt and olive oil in the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula as needed. Spoon the pesto into a bowl and set aside until ready to use.For the steak: Remove the flat iron steak from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to cooking. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the steak dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with the salt. Add the oil to the skillet, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. Carefully add the steak to the pan and place a foil-wrapped brick or a small cast-iron pan on top of the steak to weight it down. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side. Remove the weight and, using tongs, flip the steak. Cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes for medium-rare to medium doneness. Remove the steak from the pan and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain. Serve with the pesto.'

S'For the turkey: In a small bowl, mix the kosher salt, truffle salt, chopped thyme and pepper flakes. Lay the turkey flat on a rimmed baking sheet, skin-side down, and then pat it dry with paper towels. Generously sprinkle the inside of the turkey with half of the seasoning mixture, being sure the hit the thick parts a bit heavier than the thin parts. Flip the turkey and sprinkle the skin side with the remaining seasoning. Cover the turkey with a piece of loose parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Rest the turkey at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting.On a clean, rimmed baking sheet, scatter the thyme sprigs, celery, carrots, rosemary and onions. Pat the turkey dry one more time and place on the bed of vegetables skin-side up. Tuck the wings under the shoulders. Mix together the truffle butter and oil in a small bowl. Pour the butter mixture over the bird and brush evenly on the skin. Roast until an instant-read thermometer reads 155 degrees F in both the thigh and the thickest part of the breast, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.Place the turkey on a cutting board to rest for 20 minutes before carving. Strain any juices from the bottom of the baking sheet and skim off any fat that may rise to the surface. Carve the turkey.For the gravy: In a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat, heat the chicken broth, thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water until smooth and no lumps remain. Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering broth. Continue to whisk until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the reserved turkey drippings, the kosher salt and truffle salt. Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaf and serve the gravy with the carved turkey.'

S'Grease a rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil. In a small bowl, toss together the almonds, chocolate chips, and apricots. Put them on the baking sheet, spreading them out into an even single layer across the entire baking sheet. In a medium saucepan stir together the sugar and the water. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Do not stir after that. Instead, using a pastry brush dipped in water, brush the sides of the pan a few times to incorporate any sugar that has stuck to the sides of the pan. Continue cooking until the sugar syrup turns golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully pour the caramelized sugar over the nut mixture on the cookie sheet. Also, be careful not to move the cookie sheet after the sugar has been poured. The baking sheet will be very hot in the beginning.

S"Vegetable oil, for fryingFor the ravioli: In a small bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, sugar, vanilla extract, mint leaves, and orange zest. Scrape in the seeds from the vanilla bean and mix well. Using a pastry brush, brush the edges of the potsticker wrappers with the beaten egg. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the ricotta mixture into the center of the potsticker wrappers. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges of the dough to seal.In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don\\'t have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) In batches, fry the ravioli for 30 seconds on each side until golden. Drain on paper towels.For the dipping sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the orange juice and sugar over medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the syrup to cool for 20 minutes. Stir in the chopped mint.Arrange the ravioli on a platter. Pour the dipping sauce into a small dipping bowl and serve alongside the ravioli."

S'For the chicken: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.In a small bowl, mash together the butter, chopped rosemary, mustard, herbes de Provence, 1 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper with a fork until smooth. Place the chicken, breast-side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan. Using your fingers, spread half of the butter mixture under the chicken skin. Spread the remaining butter mixture over the exterior of the chicken and in the cavity. Sprinkle the cavity liberally with salt and pepper and place the rosemary sprig inside. Tie the chicken legs together with kitchen twine. Roast until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 160 degrees F, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes.For the bolognese: Place the dried porcini mushrooms and the hot chicken broth in a small bowl and let soak until the mushrooms are softened, about 20 minutes. Strain the mushrooms and reserve the broth.In a food processor, combine the carrots, onions, bell peppers and garlic. Pulse until the vegetables are finely chopped. In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped vegetables, oregano, thyme, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Cook until slightly softened, about 6 minutes. Add the porcini and fresh mushrooms, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the reserved porcini broth and tomato paste and stir until dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half and the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the mascarpone cheese until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.Cut the chicken into thin slices and arrange on a platter. Spoon the sauce over the chicken  and serve.'

S'In a large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season steaks with salt and pepper. When pan starts to smoke, carefully add steaks. Allow the steaks to cook for about 6 minutes on side, without moving or piercing the meat. This will help create a good, crusty sear. If steak starts to brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium. When steaks are brown, flip and sear the other side for 6 minutes for medium rare. Cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium well. Remove meat to a large plate and allow to rest for 10 minutes.Decoratively line a large platter with arugula. Tear the roasted peppers into large pieces and scatter over the arugula. In a small bowl, whisk the 1/4 cup-extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar and any meat juices that may have collected on the plate from the steaks. Season with salt and pepper.Slice the steaks across the grain and on a bias into 1 1/2-inch thick pieces. Lay the slices on top of the salad and drizzle with dressing.

S'For the rice: Combine the vegetable broth and ginger slices in a medium saucepan; bring to boil. Add the brown and wild rice and bring to boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until the rice is just tender, 50 to 55 minutes. Drain if necessary. Discard the ginger slices. Set the rice aside.Meanwhile, position the oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil; set aside.Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the green onions, carrots, onions, garlic, ginger, curry powder, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the golden raisins, tofu and cooked rice mixture. Add the coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1 minute until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.Remove from the heat and let cool while preparing the chard leaves.Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Using a sharp knife, cut away the thick stems from the center of each leaf; discard the stems. Cut each leaf in half lengthwise. Trim the wide ends from the leaves to make each leaf half about 10 inches long. Using tongs and working with 1 leaf half at a time, dip the leaf half into the pot of boiling salted water for 10 seconds. Transfer to paper towels to drain.Place about 1/3 cup of the rice filling onto the end of one Swiss chard leaf half. Roll up the leaf, enclosing the filling completely. Repeat with the remaining leaf halves and rice filling for a total of 12 rolls.Spread 1 cup of the sauce onto the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place the filled rolls, seam-side down, in a single layer atop the sauce in the dish. Spoon the remaining tomato sauce over the rolls. Bake until the rolls are heated through, 25 to 30 minutes.'

Pour the vodka over the peels and screw on the lid. Steep the lime peels in the vodka for 1 week at room temperature. Stir the sugar and water in a large saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Cool completely, then stir in the vodka mixture. Strain the liquids into bottles, pressing on the peels to extract as much liquid as possible. Seal the bottles and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 1 month.To make spritzers: Fill 4 tall glasses halfway with ice. Add the mint leaves. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, coarsely crush the mint leaves into the ice. Pour some limoncello over, and stir to blend. Add a splash of club soda and serve.'

Place the ravioli on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining wonton wrappers, egg, and chocolate-hazelnut spread. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Add enough oil to a heavy large frying pan to reach a depth of 2 inches. Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F. Working in batches, carefully add the ravioli to the hot oil and cook until they are golden brown, about 45 seconds per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ravioli to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Then, transfer the cooked ravioli to another baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven while frying the remaining ravioli. (The fried ravioli can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool them completely, then cover and refrigerate. Before serving, place them on a baking sheet and rewarm in a preheated 375 degrees F oven just until they are heated through, about 7 minutes.)Spray the top side of the mint leaves very lightly with nonstick spray. Working with 1 leaf at a time, dredge the coated side of the leaves in sugar to coat lightly. Arrange 2 fried ravioli on each plate. Dust the ravioli with powdered sugar.

S'In a food processor, place the tarragon and spinach and pulse 1 to 2 times to coarsely chop. Add the panko and pulse until completely combined with the tarragon and spinach (it should look like green bread crumbs). Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and set aside.In a small saute pan set over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and pancetta and cook until the pancetta is golden-brown and crispy, about 4 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the lemon juice, sugar and salt, stirring with a wooden spoon until the sugar is dissolved. Add the parsley and set aside.Pour enough grapeseed oil into 10-inch saute pan to fill it by 1/3 inch. Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F or until a few breadcrumbs sprinkled in the pan sizzle immediately but do not burn. Lightly beat the egg in a medium bowl. Add the oysters to the egg and toss gently to coat. One by one, lift them out of the egg and place them in the herb breadcrumbs. Again toss gently to make sure the oysters are coated all around, pressing gently to adhere.Place the breaded oysters, one at a time, into the hot oil. You should be able to fry about 6 at a time. Fry until golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip the oysters and cook another 1 minute to brown on the other side. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat the process with the remaining oysters.Place one oyster in each half shell and spoon some of the pancetta vinaigrette over the top. Serve warm.'

Stir over medium heat until the mixture is smooth. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, about 5 to 7 minutes. Let the mixture cool for 30 seconds. Using a long-handled, metal spoon, carefully spoon the caramel over the nuts. Allow the caramel to harden, at room temperature, for 1 hour.Put the chocolate chips in a medium stainless steel or glass bowl. Set the bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted, about 4 minutes. Spoon the chocolate over the caramel and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Using a thin-bladed spatula, remove the candies from the pan (caramel will be hard). Let the candies stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour (to allow the caramel to soften) before serving.Store in an airtight container at room temperature.'

S'Blend the Gorgonzola in a food processor until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides of the work bowl occasionally. Using 1 rounded teaspoon of cheese for each, form the cheese into 18 (1-inch) balls. Working in batches, coat the balls with the egg then with the bread crumbs. Repeat coating the balls in the egg and bread crumbs. Arrange the balls on a small baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours or overnight.Whisk the lemon juice, garlic, and lemon peel in a medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in 1/3 cup oil. Season the dressing, to taste, with salt and pepper. Set the dressing aside.Add enough oil to a heavy small saucepan to come 2 inches up the sides of the pan. Heat the oil over medium heat. At this point, remove the refrigerated Gorgonzola balls from the refrigerator. Working in batches, add the cold balls to the hot oil and fry just until golden brown, about 20 seconds. (It is essential that the Gorgonzola balls be cold when they go into the oil, otherwise they will fall apart in the oil. If they start to warm up at any point, return them to the refrigerator to firm back up.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried balls to paper towels to drain.Toss the arugula in a large bowl with enough dressing to coat. Season the salad, to taste, with salt and pepper. Mound the salad on plates. Top the salads with the hot fried Gorgonzola balls and serve immediately.'

S'For the macarons: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.In a food processor, blend the almonds until finely ground.In a large bowl, using a hand mixer on high speed, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks, about 1 minute. Gradually add the granulated sugar, beating constantly, until the mixture holds stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Beat in the almond extract, orange zest and food coloring, 1 drop at a time, if using. Using a spatula, fold in the ground almonds and powdered sugar until combined. Using a small cookie scoop, scoop eight to twelve 2-inch-diameter circles of batter onto each baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes until slightly puffed. Cool completely on the baking sheets, about 30 minutes.For the filling: Place the chocolate and cream in a medium bowl. Place the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Refrigerate until thick enough to spread, about 25 minutes.To assemble: Spoon the filling onto the flat side of half of the cookies. Place the lollipop sticks in the middle of the filling and gently press the remaining cookies on top. Allow the filling to set at room temperature, about 1 hour.'

S'Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Liberally butter the tart pan.For the crust: Combine the all-purpose flour, almond flour, almonds, cocoa powder and sugar in a food processor. Process until the almonds are finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture forms a coarse meal. With the processor running, gradually add 2 tablespoons of iced water until the mixture forms a ball, adding extra water, as needed, if the mixture is too dry. Form the dough into a disc and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.Roll out the dough into a 10-inch circle on a lightly floured work surface. Place the dough in the tart pan and trim any excess dough from the top of the pan. If the dough cracks, press scraps of dough into the cracks to seal. Prick the dough all over, using a fork, and bake for 15 minutes. Let the crust cool for 15 minutes.For the filling: Place the chocolate and butter in a small bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Beat the eggs, liqueur, sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl. Pour the melted chocolate into the egg mixture and whisk until smooth. Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Place the tart pan on a baking sheet and bake until the filing has set and begins to crack slightly on top, 22 to 25 minutes. Allow the tart to cool completely, about 1 hour.For the apricot cream: Beat the cream at high speed until stiff peaks form, using a hand mixer. Add the jam and vanilla. Beat until the jam is incorporated into the cream.Remove the tart from the pan and cut into thin wedges. Serve with a dollop of apricot cream.'

S'Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Lay a sheet of phyllo dough on a clean dry work surface. Use a pastry brush to brush the phyllo sheet with melted butter. Fold the phyllo sheet in half lengthwise, resulting in a 12  by 8-inch rectangle. Brush the top of the phyllo with melted butter. Place a few slices of smoked mozzarella at a narrow end of the phyllo rectangle, leaving 1-inch on each side. Top the cheese with a few pieces of sun-dried tomatoes. Carefully roll up the phyllo dough into a cigar shape starting with the cheese and tomato end. About half way through the rolling, tuck in the 1-inch ends of the phyllo dough, and continue rolling. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet, seam side down, and brush the top with butter. Continue rolling the 5 remaining cigars. Bake until golden, about 25 to 30 minutes.Meanwhile, in a small ball jar or in a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid combine the extra-virgin olive oil, Proseco, cider vinegar, salt, and pepper. Shake well. Toss the Proseco vinaigrette with the field greens. Place the dressed greens on a serving platter or on individual serving plates.Slice the cigars into 2-inch pieces. Place atop the dressed field greens. Serve immediately.The baked cigars are about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. The flavor is great. YUM!!'

S'For the dough: dissolve the yeast in 1 cup of warm water; after 5 minutes, it should look creamy and have bubbles forming on the surface. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast-water mixture and mix until well combined. Continue mixing for another 3 minutes. (The dough will be very soft and loose.) Pour the dough onto a heavily floured board and begin to knead, adding flour as necessary. The dough should take an additional 1/4 cup flour and the kneading should take about 5 minutes. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl with the olive oil brushed on the inside. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it aside in a warm dry place for 1 hour.Gently punch down the dough and fold it over on itself three or four times. It will again be soft and a little sticky; coat your hands with flour if they stick. Divide the dough into two balls and return to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise again for an additional 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven.Place one of the dough balls on a well-floured work surface (The dough should still be quite soft and sticky, so sprinkle some flour on the top of the dough to make it easier to work with.) Gently roll out the dough into a 10-inch circle and transfer it to a round, perforated pizza pan. Repeat with the other dough ball.For the tomato sauce: Using a potato masher, mash the tomatoes in a medium bowl until smooth. Add the salt and the torn basil leaves. Spoon the sauce evenly over one of the rolled out pizza crusts. Sprinkle the mozzarella over the sauce, arrange the whole basil leaves on top, and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.For the bianca: Drizzle the second rolled out crust with olive oil. Sprinkle the rosemary, red pepper flakes and some salt over the top. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown.'

Set the custard over another bowl of ice to cool completely.Using an electric mixer, beat the cream and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in another large bowl until firm peaks form. Using a large rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the custard. Spoon the mixture atop the prepared crust.

Place dish in freezer and every hour, scrape the mixture with a large fork to create the granita texture. The granita will need approximately five hours to completely freeze. The first time you scrape, the granita will not be frozen solid. You want to start scraping while it\\'s still slushy so that texture of the granita will be even throughout.Right before serving, make the whipped cream. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks. Add the vanilla extract and confectioners\\' sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks.Line up 12 glass Champagne flutes. Place 1 tablespoon of granita in the bottom of each glass. Using a different spoon, spread a layer of whipped cream. Continue layering the granita and whipped cream, ending with the whipped cream. Sprinkle chocolate over the top of each glass. Garnish with a sprig of mint. Serve immediately."

S"Cook\\'s Note: To remove the pulp from Hachiya persimmons, remove the top with a knife and scoop out the pulp with a spoon.For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a 9-inch-diameter glass or ceramic pie dish with vegetable oil cooking spray.In a food processor, blend the flour, sugar and salt until combined. Add the butter and mascarpone cheese and blend until moist clumps form. Gather the dough into a ball. Drop 2-inch pieces of dough over the bottom and sides of the pie dish. Using moist fingertips press the dough together to form a smooth crust. Using the tines of a fork, prick the dough all over.Bake the crust until the edge is browned and the center of the crust is pale golden, about 25 minutes. Transfer the crust to a work surface. Brush the bottom and sides of the crust with apricot preserves.For the filling: In a food processor, combine the pumpkin and persimmon. Blend until smooth. Add the sugar, mascarpone, cream, cornstarch, cinnamon, salt and eggs. Blend until smooth. Pour the filling into the cooked crust.Bake the pie until slits or cracks appear around the edge and the center is set, about 35 minutes. Cool the pie on a rack. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Bake and cool to room temperature. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)Just before serving, dust the top of the pie with powdered sugar. Cut into wedges and serve."

Whisking constantly, cook until the butter has melted and the mixture has formed a smooth sauce, about 8 minutes.Spread the bacon out on a small baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, just to begin to render the fat. Set aside.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and simmer until just barely tender and still bright green, 5 minutes. Remove the Brussels sprouts to a baking sheet to cool slightly. Slice each Brussels sprout in half.Preheat a grill pan over medium heat, and spray with nonstick cooking spray.Assemble the skewers: Start by threading a Brussels sprout half onto a skewer, then add a piece of bacon, then another Brussels sprout, followed by another piece of bacon, and finishing with a Brussels sprout. Repeat in this way until all of the skewers are assembled. Brush the skewers lightly with bourbon glaze.Place the skewers on the prepared grill pan and grill, brushing them with glaze with every turn, until the bacon is beginning to crisp and the Brussels sprouts are starting to char, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to a serving platter and serve warm, drizzled with any remaining glaze.'

S'Spray a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan with vegetable cooking spray. Line the bottom and sides of the pan with waxed paper, allowing the paper to overhang by 2-inches on each side. Lightly spray the waxed paper inside the pan.In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the sugar, water, and honey over low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a simmer, and cook until the syrup turns amber and registers 315 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 15 to 20 minutes.While the syrup is cooking, in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks, about 2 minutes.With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour the syrup into the egg whites. Increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is very thick, about 7 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Fold in 1/2 of the apricots. Using a spatula sprayed with cooking spray, scrape the mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the remaining apricots on top. Fold the overhanging pieces of waxed paper onto the surface of the mixture. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Remove the waxed paper from the nougat and discard. Using a knife sprayed with cooking spray, cut the nougat in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 8 pieces. Dip 1 end of the nougat into the melted chocolate and place on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.'

S'To make the sauce: Blend the strawberries and sugar in a food processor until smooth. Strain the puree through a fine mesh strainer. Cover and refrigerate. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.)To make the pudding: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter 6 (6-ounce) custard cups. Arrange the cups in a large roasting pan. Melt the chocolate in a medium bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Set the melted chocolate aside. Blend the ricotta, 1/4 cup of sugar, egg yolks, orange zest, almond extract, cinnamon, and salt in a food processor until very smooth. Blend in the melted chocolate. Transfer the ricotta mixture to a large bowl. Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites in another large bowl with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar. Continue beating until semi-firm peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the ricotta mixture. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cups. Fill the pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the custard cups. Bake until the pudding puffs slightly but the centers are still creamy, about 25 minutes (the pudding will become thick and creamy when cold). Allow puddings to cool slightly before removing from water bath. Remove the custard cups from the bath. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours.Run a knife around the sides of the puddings to loosen. Invert the puddings onto plates. Drizzle the strawberry sauce around the puddings and serve.'

Pulse dough just until it comes together.Place the dough into an 11-inch diameter tart pan with a removable bottom and press down to cover the bottom and sides of the pan. Refrigerate until the dough is firm, about 30 minutes.Line the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the tart shell in the lower third of the oven until just set, about 25 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and pie weights. Bake until the tart shell is lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Cool completely.Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar with the water in a small saucepan over low heat. You don\\'t want to boil the water, you just want to heat it so that the sugar can dissolve thoroughly. Stir until the sugar dissolves and remove from heat.In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the ricotta cheese and cream cheese until smooth. Add the eggs and egg yolks, 1 at a time, and process until smooth. With the machine running, add the sugar syrup in a thin steady stream and process until smooth.Pour the custard into the tart shell and bake until the filling is almost set, about 20 to 25 minutes. Scatter the remaining 3/4 cup of toasted pine nuts atop the filling. Bake until the custard is set, about 10 minutes longer. Let the tart cool completely before serving.The tart can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Return the tart to room temperature before serving."

There should be 1 1/2 to 2 cups of reduced sauce. Let the sauce cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Stir in the mozzarella cheese and prosciutto.Meanwhile, place 1 piece of dough on a work surface. Roll the dough out gently until you can cut an 8 1/2 by 9 1/2-inch rectangle. Press the scraps into a small rectangle and roll it out to the same thickness as the other rectangle. Cut 3 rectangles from the large rectangle and 1 rectangle from the small rectangle. Each should measure 8 1/2 by 3 inches. Continue rolling and cutting the remaining pie dough.To form the tarts, place the rectangles on a work surface. Brush each rectangle with egg wash. Place a large spoonful of the marinara mixture in the middle of the bottom half of the rectangle. Fold the dough in half over the marinara mixture to make a 3 by 4-inch rectangle. Press the edges to seal. Using a scalloped ravioli cutter, trim the rectangles to make a decorative edge. Place the tarts on the baking sheets. Brush with egg wash and generously sprinkle with cheese. Bake until golden, about 20 to 25 minutes.'

Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. (The mustard can be made up to 2 days in advance.)For the crostini: Slice the baguette on a steep bias into 1/4-inch slices; it should yield about 18 to 20 slices. Brush each slice with some of the olive oil and place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with the salt and broil until golden brown and crunchy, 5 to 6 minutes. Set aside to cool.To assemble, spread 1/2 teaspoon of the arugula mustard onto each crostini. Top with a ribbon of cucumber and a piece of prosciutto, folded into a ribbon-like shape. Serve.'

S'Heat a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the olive oil and pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta to a paper-towel-lined plate and reserve.To the pan with the pancetta drippings, add the shallots, garlic and salt. Cook until fragrant, stirring with a wooden spoon, 2 minutes. Stir in the rice and coat with all the flavors of the pan. Toast the rice for 2 minutes. Deglaze with 1 cup of the prosecco and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid is almost entirely absorbed. Add 1 cup of the clam juice and cook, stirring, until almost completely absorbed, 6 to 8 minutes. Continue adding the clam juice, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring often and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next. Cook until the rice is tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, to a small saucepan, add the remaining 1/2 cup prosecco and the New Zealand clams. Cover the pan and place over high heat. Cook, shaking occasionally, until the clams have opened, about 4 minutes. Discard any clams that do not open. Set aside.To finish the risotto, stir in the Parmesan, butter, reserved pancetta and the chopped littleneck clams along with their juice. Cook until the clams are cooked through and the butter and cheese are melted in, an additional 2 minutes. The risotto should have some movement and not be too thick.In a small bowl, mix together the parsley and lemon zest. Stir half of the mixture into the risotto. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the steamed New Zealand clams over the top of the risotto and finish with the remaining parsley mixture.'

Pulse in the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until moist clumps form. Gather the dough into a ball; flatten into a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Roll out the dough on a floured surface to an 11-inch round. Transfer the dough onto a heavy baking sheet that has been lined with a silicon pad or parchment paper. Stir the lemon juice into the preserves and spread the preserves on top of dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks in the dough.Bake the crostata until the crust is golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool. Sprinkle with the almonds and dust with the powdered sugar, if you wish. Slide a metal spatula under the crust to free the crostata from the baking sheet and serve.'

S'For the pastry dough: Whisk the eggs and vanilla in a small bowl to blend. Mix the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub in with your fingers until the butter is the size of small peas. Add the egg mixture and mix with a fork until the dough comes together. Gather the dough into a ball. Divide the dough in 2 and flatten into disks. Wrap the dough disks in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour.  Meanwhile, for the filling and cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper. Finely chop the figs and raisins in a food processor. Add the honey, orange juice, cinnamon, and lemon zest, and pulse just to blend. Scrape the fig mixture into a medium bowl. Stir in the walnuts. Transfer the fruit mixture to a pastry bag. Roll out 1 disk of dough on a floured work surface to 1/8 to 1/4-inch thickness. Using a 2 1/2-inch diameter biscuit cutter, cut out dough rounds. Gather the dough scraps into a disk, then cover and refrigerate while assembling the cookies. Spoon the fruit mixture in the center of each dough round. Lightly moisten the edges of the dough with the egg wash. Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges to seal. Arrange the cookies evenly apart on the prepared baking sheets. Brush the tops of the cookies with egg wash. Bake until the cookies are pale golden, about 18 minutes.  Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and cool completely. Repeat with the refrigerated dough scraps and remaining filling.'

In the middle of the rectangle, place the turkey mixture, shaping into a loaf. Using the parchment paper, wrap the pancetta up and around the turkey loaf to cover completely. Squeeze the parchment-covered loaf with your hands to secure the pancetta and solidify the shape of the loaf. While still covered in parchment, bake the loaf until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.In a blender, combine the arugula and the mayonnaise and process until smooth. Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.To make the sandwiches, slice the rolls and spread with the arugula mayonnaise. Slice the turkey meatloaf and place on the rolls to make sandwiches.'

S'For the crisps: Fill a medium saucepan with 1/2 inch of vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Slice the potatoes 1/8-inch thick, using a Japanese mandoline. Working in batches so as not to crowd the pan, fry the potatoes until crispy and golden brown, about 4 minutes per batch. With a spider or slotted spoon, remove the potatoes to a paper-towel-lined tray and drain well. Season with a few grinds of black pepper.For the goat cheese: Using a rubber spatula, mix the goat cheese, mascarpone and orange zest together until well combined and smooth. Set aside at room temperature.For the olive spread: Add the olives, capers and rosemary to a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Add the olive oil and pulse to puree; the finished spread should still have a little texture but be cohesive.To assemble: Place a dollop of the goat cheese mixture on each potato crisp and top with a spoonful of the olive spread.'

S"To make the pizzelles: Preheat the pizzelle iron to medium-high heat. Whisk the sugar, egg whites, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl to blend. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the flour and whisk just until blended.Brush the pizzelle cooking surfaces with some of the remaining melted butter. Spoon 1 tablespoon of batter in the center of the pizzelle iron. Close the iron and cook until deep golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer the pizzelles to a cooling rack. Cool completely. Trim off any excess pizzelle along the edges. Store the pizzelles airtight at room temperature.To make the ice cream sandwiches: Gently spread the chocolate-hazelnut spread over 1 side of 12 pizzelles. Cut the ice cream carton to remove the ice cream from the carton in one piece. Starting at the widest end of the piece of ice cream, cut the ice cream crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Place 1 slice of ice cream atop each coated pizzelle. (Alternately, the ice cream can be scooped atop the pizzelle.) Top each with a second pizzelle, pressing gently to adhere. Arrange the sandwiches on a baking sheet and freeze until firm. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight and keep frozen,)Dust the ice cream sandwiches with powdered sugar and serve.Cook\\'s Note: If the ice cream sandwiches are eaten immediately, the pizzelles will be crisp. However, if the sandwiches freeze overnight, the pizzelles will soften just enough to allow the sandwiches to be cut into wedges, if desired."

Using a 2 3/4-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out dough rounds. Add enough oil to a heavy large frying pan with 3-inch sides to come halfway up the sides of the pan. Heat the oil over medium heat until hot. Drop a scrap of dough into the oil to ensure the oil is hot enough. If the dough sizzles, then the oil is hot enough. Working in batches, add the dough rounds to the hot oil (being sure not to crowd them in the pan) and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the rounds to paper towels to drain the excess oil. Immediately sprinkle the cheese mixture over the hot pizzas. Serve warm.'

S'Butter the bottom and sides of an 8 by 8-inch straight-sided baking pan. Dust liberally with sifted powdered sugar and set aside.Pour 1/2 cup water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and allow to soften, about 10 minutes.In a 3-quart saucepan, combine the sugar, evaporated milk and 1/4 cup water. Stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, about 10 to 12 minutes. Pour the syrup over the gelatin mixture. Beat the mixture at low speed until incorporated. Increase the speed to high and beat until thick, fluffy and tripled in volume, about 10 to 12 minutes. Beat in the orange zest and vanilla extract until just combined. Using a spatula, scrape the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Sprinkle with orange decorating sugar. Allow the mixture to set, uncovered, in a cool place (not refrigerated) for at least 8 hours or overnight. Remove the marshmallows from the pan and place on a powdered sugar-dusted surface. Using scissors, dusted with powdered sugar, cut the marshmallows into about 1-inch squares. Dip the cut sides into powdered sugar to prevent sticking. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.'

S'For the meringue: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a pencil, trace two 8-inch-diameter circles, side-by-side, on the parchment paper.Beat the egg whites until fluffy in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Gradually add the superfine sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, with the machine running on medium-low speed, until the mixture holds soft peaks. Beat in the cream of tartar and salt. Increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is thick and holds stiff peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Place the meringue in the piping bag. Pipe the meringue into two 8-inch circles on the prepared baking sheet using the traced circles as a guide. Bake until crisp, 2 hours. Turn off the oven and allow the meringues to cool completely while still in the oven, about 2 hours.For the cream: Beat the cream on high speed until thick using an electric hand mixer. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Continue to beat on high speed until the cream holds stiff peaks. Add the raspberries and beat until incorporated into the cream.Spread one-third of the cream over each meringue circle. Place 1 circle on top of the other to create 2 layers. Spread the remaining cream on the sides of the cake. Garnish with fresh raspberries if using, and freeze the cake until firm, 3 hours.For the syrup: Mix the raspberries, vinegar and maple syrup in a small saucepan. Lightly mash the raspberries using a fork. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until thick, 25 to 30 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve and allow to cool.To serve: Allow the cake to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Cut the cake into wedges and place on serving plates. Drizzle with the syrup and serve.'

Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don\\'t have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) Working in batches, carefully add the polenta cubes and fry, stirring occasionally to keep the cubes separated, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with the Parmesan.To serve: Ladle the gazpacho into 4 soup bowls and top with the polenta croutons."

Press into a disk, cover, and refrigerate for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cook the pancetta in a small saute pan over medium heat until golden and crisp, about 4 minutes. Add the herbs and stir. Transfer the pancetta, herbs, and the pan juices to a medium bowl. Add the leftover vegetables, grated cheeses, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Toss to combine and set aside.Place the chilled dough on parchment paper. Roll the dough out into a 12-inch wide circle about 1/4-inch thick. Spread the vegetables out in the center of the dough leaving a 2-inch border. Sprinkle the vegetable mixture with Parmesan. Fold the border up and over the vegetables forming a crust. Using a pastry brush, brush some of the egg over the crust. Transfer the parchment paper and crostata to a baking sheet. Bake until the crust is golden, about 25 minutes. Slice and serve.'

S'Make the pesto: Place the almonds and garlic in a food processor. Pulse to roughly chop. Add the basil, lemon zest and parmigiano and pulse to combine. Add the olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt and puree until a smooth paste forms.Make the sandwich: Open the loaf of bread and pull out some of the excess bread from the inside, leaving a slightly hollowed-out loaf. Spread the pesto evenly over the inside of the bread. Layer the coppa, finocchiona and mozzarella on the bottom half of the bread. Toss together the arugula, fennel, lemon juice and olive oil in a small bowl. Place the salad on top of the meats and cheese. Top with the remaining half of the bread and press together. Wrap the sandwich tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight before slicing and serving.Photograph by Ryan Liebe'

S'Bake the cookies according to package directions and cool completely.Make the turkey feathers by drawing a zigzag pattern along the edge of half of a cookie with the orange gel. Place 7 pieces of candy corn, pointed-side in, along the zigzag to hold in place. Just below the feathers, make the face: squeeze 2 dots of the black gel for the eyes and a small "V" just below the eyes for the beak. Place a chocolate chip over each dot of gel to finish the eyes. Below the face, draw two legs with the black gel; draw 2 parallel, vertical lines and 3 toes coming off of each leg. Break the pretzels to the size of the legs and adhere them to the black gel. The first turkey is complete! Repeat for the remaining cookies.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lay 1 phyllo sheet on a work surface. Brush the phyllo with melted butter. Top with another phyllo sheet. Repeat with more butter and 2 more phyllo sheets. Cut the stacked phyllo sheets into 6 (5-inch) squares. Line each muffin cup with 1 stacked phyllo square, allowing the edges to ruffle and extend above the cup rims. Repeat with the remaining 4 phyllo sheets and melted butter. Bake until the phyllo cups are golden brown, about 9 minutes. Transfer the muffin pan to a cooling rack and cool completely. Meanwhile, stir the white chocolate and 1/4 cup cream in a heavy small saucepan over low heat until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Pour into a large bowl and cool to barely lukewarm. Stir in the hazelnuts. Using an electric mixer, beat the remaining 1 1/4 cups cream in another large bowl to medium-firm peaks. Fold the cream into the white chocolate mixture in 2 batches. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.Spoon 2 teaspoons of the chocolate hazelnut spread into each phyllo cup, if using. Spoon the white chocolate mousse into the cooled phyllo cups, mounding slightly. Arrange the mousse-filled phyllo cups on plates. Sprinkle the bittersweet chocolate over the mousse, or garnish with edible flowers, and serve.Do-Ahead Tip: The unfilled phyllo cups can be made 2 days ahead. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature. The white chocolate mousse can be made up to 8 hours ahead. Keep it refrigerated. The filled phyllo cups can be assembled up to 1 hour ahead. Cover and refrigerate them.'

S'To make the syrup: Combine 1 cup of water and brown sugar in a heavy medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil until the syrup reduces to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cream and cinnamon. Keep the syrup warm. (The syrup can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, then cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before serving.)Meanwhile, prepare the French toast: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Trim the bottom crust of the panettone. Starting at the bottom end of the panettone, cut it crosswise into 6 (3/4-inch thick) round slices (reserve the top piece for toast!). In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until well blended. Add the cream, milk, and sugar and whisk until well mixed. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter on a large nonstick griddle over medium heat. Dip 3 slices of panettone into the custard, turning to allow both sides to absorb the custard. Grill the soaked panettone slices until they are golden brown and firm to the touch, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the French toast to a baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining butter, panettone slices, and custard.Transfer the French toast to plates. Dollop the mascarpone atop each. Lightly dust with the powdered sugar. Drizzle the cinnamon syrup over and around the French toast and serve immediately.'

Scoop out 16 bite-sized balls of gelato and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Remove from the freezer and quickly insert a wooden popstick into each gelato ball. Return them to the freezer for at least 1 hour. When the gelato balls have frozen with their sticks in place, place the chocolate in a double-boiler over very gently simmering water until melted. Next to the pot of chocolate, place the toasted, chopped hazelnuts in a shallow bowl. Remove the gelato balls from the freezer, 4 at a time. Working quickly, hold the gelato ball by the stick and dip into the melted chocolate, then dredge it in the hazelnuts. Return them to the freezer and continue with 4 more gelato balls, until all the gelato balls are covered in chocolate and nuts. Freeze the chocolate-and-nut-covered gelato for at least 1 hour. These are very fun, festive, and tasty. The ice cream scoop I used is a number 40 (holds 1 tablespoon, is 1 1/2 inches in diameter.)'

Add the apple cider, cinnamon, star anise, peppercorns and salt; bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced to 2/3 cup, about 20 minutes. Strain and keep warm.Lay a wonton wrapper on a work surface (Keep the remaining wrappers under a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.) Place two fig halves, a few crumbles of Gorgonzola and a sprinkling of nuts just off center on the wonton. Brush the edges of the wrapper with egg; fold one half over the filling to make a triangle and press the edges to seal. Transfer the ravioli to a plate and cover with a damp towel. Repeat until all of the wonton wrappers are filled.Heat 1/4 inch of grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium heat. One by one, add the ravioli to the oil; work in batches to avoid crowding the pan. Cook for 2 minutes on the first side, or until golden brown. Flip and cook for an additional 2 minutes, until golden brown all the way around. Remove the ravioli to a paper towel-lined plate and keep warm. Serve warm with the apple cider brown butter on the side for dipping.'

S'In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the mustard and 1/4 cup water to a simmer. Whisk in the goat cheese until combined. Set aside; the mixture will thicken as it cools.Toast the mini bagels until golden brown and crispy. Set aside.In a medium nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add 4 slices of the pancetta and cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain the pancetta on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining pancetta.Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a small frying pan over medium-low heat. Crack 4 quail eggs into the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining eggs.To build the PLT: Spread each bagel half with 1 tablespoon of the goat cheese sauce. Layer with a slice of pancetta, a slice of tomato, and some arugula. Top the whole thing with a fried quail egg and a grind of freshly ground black pepper. Serve.'

S'For the bao starter: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, water, sugar and yeast. Let stand until puffed up and has bubbles on the surface, about 20 minutes.For the chocolate sauce: In a medium bowl, mix together the chips, butter and vanilla. Place the bowl over a barely simmering saucepan of water and stir until the chocolate has melted. Whisk in the cream until the mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature.For the chocolate bao: In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, the cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the flour mixture and oil to the starter and stir together while gradually adding 1/2 cup room temperature water. Stop adding water once the dough has come together enough to knead by hand. Dump the dough onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until you have a smooth, satiny dough, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the dough to the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 3 hours.Spray a stainless-steel steamer with vegetable oil cooking spray. Use your hands to roll the dough into a long log, about 2 inches wide and 12 inches long. Cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Place a few chocolate chips in the center of each dough piece and stretch the dough around the chips, pinching one end to form a ball. Place the ball seam-side down onto a wax paper square. Continue with the remaining pieces of dough.Gently lower the bao in batches into a prepared steamer. Steam for 10 minutes, then carefully remove and let cool under a kitchen towel.Serve warm with chocolate sauce for dipping.'

Stir to dissolve sugar.  Remove from heat and cool.Add the ricotta cheese and cream cheese in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Add the egg and egg yolks, 1 at a time, and process until smooth. Add the melted chocolate and the sugar syrup and pulse until combined. Pour the custard into the tart shell and bake until the custard is just set, about 30 minutes.  Scatter the remaining 1/4 cup of chopped hazelnuts on top of the filling. Let the tart cool completely before serving.The tart can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Return the tart to room temperature before serving.'

Transfer the potato into a colander and let cool slightly. Peel and coarsely chop the potato. Then process the potato in a food processor to very small chunks, 10 to 15 pulses. In a large bowl combine the flour, 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Add to the processed potatoes, mixing well with a spoon or spatula to distribute the flour mixture evenly through the potatoes. Form spoonfuls of the mixture into 2-inch logs.Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F.

S'For the short ribs: Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the ribs all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. In a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or ovenproof stock pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the ribs in batches and brown on all sides, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the ribs and set aside. Add the garlic, onions and remaining salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add the wine and mustard and bring to a boil, scraping the brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Return the ribs to the pot and pour over the beef broth. Cover and transfer to the oven until the meat is fork-tender and falls easily from the bone, 2 hours 30 minutes.For the glaze: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the soy sauce, brown sugar and red pepper flakes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and cook until thickened slightly, 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature.For the corn puree: In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, salt and pepper and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Transfer to a food processor with the corn and pulse until combined. Add the cream and process until smooth. Set aside.For assembling and cooking the dumplings: Pull the short rib meat from the bone and shred into a bowl. Lay the wonton wrappers out on a cutting board. Place 1 tablespoon of the corn puree on each wrapper and top with 1 tablespoon of the shredded short ribs.  Moisten the edges of the wonton with water. Lift the corners of the wrapper and pinch them together. Continue with the remaining dumplings.Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place half of the dumplings flat-side down in the oil and fry until the bottoms are golden brown, 2 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water, cover the skillet and steam the dumplings until the wontons are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm while you cook the rest of the dumplings. Transfer all the dumplings to a platter and serve with the soy chili glaze.'

S'For the crust: Add the flour, salt, and sugar to a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the butter is finely chopped and the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the mascarpone cheese and lemon juice and pulse a few times. Add the ice water and run the machine just until the mixture is moist and crumbly, but does not form a ball. Do not overmix. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap. Press into a disk, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.For the filling: Put an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the apricots, walnuts, lemon zest, cinnamon, and sea salt. Add the honey and stir until all the ingredients are coated. Stir in 2/3 of the cheese.Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit inside a 12 by 17-inch baking sheet and put it on a work surface. Put the chilled dough on the parchment paper. Roll the dough into an 11-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Lift the parchment paper and transfer it to a baking sheet. Put the apricot filling in the center of the dough, spreading evenly, leaving a 2-inch border.  Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round.  Pleat the edge of the pastry and pinch to seal any cracks in the dough. Arrange the remaining cheese on top of the filling.Using a pastry brush, brush the crust with the beaten egg.  Bake until the crust starts to turn golden, about 15 to 18 minutes.  Cover the crostata loosely with a piece of foil and cook until the crust is golden and the cheese has melted, another 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the crostata from the oven to a cutting board and uncover. Cool for 10 minutes, then cut into slices and arrange on a serving platter. Serve while still warm.'

S"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut a 3/4-inch wide strip off each side of the pastry and reserve. Roll out the pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface to a 10-inch square and transfer to a sheet pan or cookie sheet. Brush the edges of the square with the egg. Working with 1 strip at a time, stand the strips along the edges of the pastry square and crimp where they meet. You want to create a shallow box, where the pastry square is the base and the 4 strips are the walls. Overlap the strips at the corners, stretching them, if necessary, to complete the walls of the box. Brush the border with the egg. Pierce the center of the pastry all over with fork. Bake until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely.Using an electric mixer, beat the cream to soft peaks. With the mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat to stiff peaks. Add the liqueur and beat until just well blended; be careful not to overmix or the whipped cream will turn into a buttery consistency and start to separate. Using a large spatula, fold in the nuts. Spoon the cream mixture into the prepared pastry crust. Arrange the berries over the cream. Sift the cocoa powder over and serve.Note: You can use any fruit that\\'s in season (orange segments, berries, plums, bananas, grapes). Blueberries make a good substitute for the raspberries, and sliced peaches or nectarines are delicious as well."

Stir the oil, rosemary, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper in a small bowl to blend. Place the pork loin in a heavy roasting pan. Spread the oil mixture over the pork to coat completely. Roast until an instant read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 145 degrees F, turning the pork every 15 minutes to ensure even browning, about 45 minutes total. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Let the pork rest 15 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the chicken broth into the roasting pan. Place the pan over medium heat, and scrape the bottom of the pan to remove any browned bits. Bring the pan juices to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Using a large sharp knife, cut the pork crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange the pork slices on plates. Spoon the jus over. Drizzle the warm fig sauce around and serve immediately.'

Cut the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the water mixture using a paring knife. Add the empty vanilla pods. Stir the water mixture over medium heat until the gelatin has dissolved. Set aside to cool slightly. Remove and discard the vanilla pods.Beat the cream until thick using an electric hand mixer in a medium bowl. Add the sugar and continue to beat until the cream holds soft peaks. Add the water mixture, coconut milk and rum. Beat until thick and light.Pour the mixture into an 8-by-8-inch glass baking dish. Freeze until the mixture is the texture of soft-serve ice cream, about 2 1/2 hours.Scoop the mixture into small glasses using an ice cream scoop. Garnish with toasted coconut and serve. Freeze any unused ice cream in an airtight container.Cook\\'s Notes: To toast coconut, place sweetened or unsweetened, shredded or flaked coconut in a single layer on a baking sheet. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.If freezing the ice cream for longer than 2 1/2 hours, allow the ice cream to stand at room temperature until softened, about 30 minutes before serving.

Lay  pancake down on a work surface, top with 2 spoonfuls of vegetable mixture, sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Roll up the pancake around the vegetable mixture and place in the baking dish. Continue with the remaining pancakes, placing in the baking dish in 2 rows, and using up all the shredded mozzarella cheese.Place the remaining vegetable mixture in a blender with 1/2 cup whole milk. Blend until smooth adding up to 1/4 cup more milk if necessary to make a sauce. Pour the sauce over the center of the vegetable-stuffed pancakes in two rows.

S'For the cupcakes: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a mini-muffin pan with cupcake liners. In a large bowl, sift together the cocoa powder, flour, sugar, baking soda and salt. Add the egg, milk, water, oil and vanilla and mix with a wooden spoon or spatula until the batter is smooth. Divide the batter equally into the mini-muffin cups, filling each cup about 2/3 full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, with no crumbs attached, about 18 minutes. Transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack and cool completely.For the whipped cream: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the heavy cream, mascarpone, powdered sugar and vanilla. Whip until the cream has soft peaks, about 2 minutes. Transfer 1/4 cup of the whipped cream into a piping bag and frost 6 of the cupcakes. Decorate the cupcakes with some of the sprinkles. Place the frosted cupcakes in the freezer and chill the rest of the whipped cream in the refrigerator while you make the shakes.For the shakes: In a blender, combine the ice cream, milk and cocoa powder and blend until smooth. Add the unfrosted cupcakes and pulse a few times to incorporate, then puree until the cupcakes are mixed well throughout. Pour the milkshakes into 6 glasses and top each with a dollop of whipped cream and a few more sprinkles. Push a straw through each frosted mini cupcake and insert the straws into the shakes.'

Place 1 melon ball in the center of a prosciutto slice, gather all sides to the top and secure with a blanched chive. It may be necessary to overlap a few pieces of prosciutto in order to completely wrap the melon ball. Place finished purse, seam side down onto a baking sheet and keep covered. Repeat with remaining prosciutto and melons. Can make it only up to 2 hours ahead of time because the salt in the prosciutto will break down the melon.Scatter the chives onto a decorative platter.
