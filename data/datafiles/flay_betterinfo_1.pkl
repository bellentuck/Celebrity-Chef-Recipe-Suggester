To toast a bun on a grill, grill pan, or griddle, split the bun open, place it cut side down on the grill, and grill until light golden brown, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, you can place the split bun halves cut side up on a baking sheet and cook them under a preheated broiler until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Keep a close eye on them and don\\'t let them get too brown or else that texture will take on a life of its own and defeat the purpose of starting with a soft bun."

S'For the dressing: Whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, garlic in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Let sit while potatoes boil to allow the flavors to meld.For the salad: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Toss the poblanos with a few tablespoons of canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put the poblanos on a baking sheet and roast  until the skin is blackened on all sides, turning a few times, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and immediately cover with plastic wrap. Let sit and steam for at least 15 minutes and up to a few hours. Transfer to a cutting board and remove the skin and seeds. Thinly slice the poblanos and set aside.While the chiles are roasting, put the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover by 2inches of cold water. Add 2 tablespoons salt to the water and bring to a boil overhigh heat. Cook until a skewer or paring knife inserted into the center of the potatoes meets  no resistance, about 25 minutes (depending on the size of thepotatoes). Drain and let cool for at least 5 minutes on a cutting board. Cut the potatoes into 1-inch dice.Heat 3 tablespoons canola oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Add the potatoes in a single layer and cook, pressing firmly with a spatula, until a crust has formed on the bottom. Gently turn them and cook until all sides are golden brown and crisp, adding more oil if needed. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, add the chiles, radicchio and dressing and stir gently to combine. Fold in the cilantro and green onions and serve warm or at room temperature.'

S'Put the cabbage in a large bowl, toss with the salt and let stand, tossing occasionally, about 2 hours. Rinse the cabbage well, then drain and squeeze out the excess water with your hands. Transfer to a large clean bowl. Combine the garlic, serrano, ginger, fish sauce, vinegar and 2 tablespoons of water in a food processor and process until smooth. Pour over the cabbage, add the green onion and sesame seeds and toss to combine. Cover and let marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour, stirring a few times. For the pork:Whisk together the cola, soy, vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, cilantro and black pepper in a large baking dish until combined. Add the pork steak and turn to coat. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours.     Heat the grill to high. Remove the pork steak from the marinade 30 minutes before grilling to take the chill off. Grill the steak until golden brown, charred on both sides, cooked to medium doneness, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 150 degrees F, about 15 minutes. Remove from the grill to a cutting board and let rest, loosely tented with foil for 10 minutes. Cut against the grain into thin strips. Fill lettuce leaves with some of the pork, a drizzle of the sauce and top with the kimchi. Arrange on a serving platter and serve.For the sauce:Whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl.'

S'For the dip: Whisk together the yogurt, sugar, orange zest and vanilla in a small bowl. Stir in  just enough cream to make a clingy dipping sauce. Cover and refrigerate while you prepared the biscotti. Remove from the refrigerator 5 minutes before using.For the biscotti: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, lightly spray with nonstick spray and set aside.Whisk together the flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.Whisk together the eggs in a small bowl until smooth. Add the maple syrup, butter, oil and vanilla and whisk until combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients along with the apricots and cranberries and mix with a wooden spoon until the dough just comes together; it will be wet. Using lightly floured hands (the dough may be a bit sticky so re-flour your hands as needed) transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet and shape into a log about 12 inches-by-4 inches.Bake until lightly golden and firm to the touch, about 20 minutes. The log will have spread quite a bit. Cool on the pan on a cooling rack for 10 minutes (or until the log is cool enough to handle).Slice the log into 1/3-inch-wide slices on the diagonal. Lay the slices down on the sheet pan and bake until dry, 10 to 12 minutes longer. Let the slices sit on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a cooling rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes. Once the biscotti are cool, serve with the yogurt dip. The biscotti will keep 1 week at room temperature in a tightly sealed container.'

S'Special equipment: 1-inch and 2-inch round cuttersBring the milk to a simmer in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, then remove from the heat and stir in the sugar and salt. Pour into a large bowl and let cool slightly.While the milk is cooling, dissolve the yeast in 2 tablespoons warm water in a small bowl, stirring. Let stand for 5 minutes.Stir the yeast mixture into the milk mixture along with the oil, lemon zest and eggs. Stir in 2 1/2 cups of the flour with a wooden spoon to make a very soft dough. Spread 1 cup of the flour on a work surface and put the dough on top, scraping it from the bowl with a rubber spatula. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, incorporating all of the flour from the work surface and adding just enough additional flour (if necessary); the dough should be slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to an oiled large bowl and sprinkle lightly with additional flour. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll out with a floured rolling pin until 1 inch thick. Cut out rounds with a 2-inch cutter. To make ring shapes, cut out doughnut holes with a 1-inch cutter. Place on a baking sheet, cover the doughnuts with another kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.While the doughnuts rise, heat about 10 cups vegetable oil in a deep 4-quart pot until it registers 365 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Fry the doughnuts 2 at a time, turning once or twice, until puffed and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain.'

S'For the date molasses: Combine the dates and 3 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan on medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer until softened, stirring occasionally and skimming foam every few minutes, about 15 minutes. Once the dates start to soften, use a wooden spoon to mash them. Strain into a clean saucepan through a fine-mesh sieve. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.For the pan-roasted apples: Melt the butter in a large skillet over high heat. Add the sugar and cook until starting to brown. Add the apples, lemon juice, cardamom and cinnamon. Cook, tossing constantly, until very well caramelized and soft, about 5 minutes. Add the apple cider; cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Keep warm.For the yogurt whipped cream: In a medium bowl, whip the cream, yogurt and vanilla seeds to soft peaks. Chill until ready to serve.For the French toast: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Set a rack over a baking sheet.In a baking dish, whisk together the eggs and yolks. Add the half-and-half, vanilla and cardamom; mix until combined.Add 4 slices of bread to the egg mixture; soak for about 30 seconds on each side. In a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat, heat half of the butter and oil until shimmering. Add the soaked bread and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the French toast to the rack and keep warm in the oven. Soak and cook the remaining slices of bread, using the remaining butter and oil.To serve: Place a slice of French toast on a serving plate; top with a spoonful of pan-roasted apples, a drizzle of date molasses, a dollop of yogurt-whipped cream, another slice of French toast, more apples, more yogurt and a final drizzle of date molasses.

S'Heat the butter in a medium saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook until soft. Stir in the sweet potato puree and salt and pepper and cook until the puree is slightly thickened (you are making a sort of sweet potato roux). Increase the heat to high, add the wine and cook until completely reduced. Add the clam juice and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the mixture appears to be too thick, thin with a little extra clam juice or water, season with salt and pepper. Strain the mixture into a bowl and return to the pan. To Finish:Heat the butter in a small saute pan over medium high heat. Add the potatoes and cook until golden brown and caramelized. When the potatoes are almost cooked through, sprinkle with the sugar and toss until the sugar is dissolved and the potatoes are cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.Heat a pan over medium heat, add the bacon and cook until golden brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Bring wine to a boil in a medium saucepan, add the clams, cover and cook until all clams open, discarding any that do not, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the clams with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl. Bring sweet potato chowder base to a simmer. Add the cooked bacon, sweet potatoes and honey and cook for 1 minute. Add the chopped clams and cook for 2 minutes. Add the heavy cream and cook an additional minute or until just heated through. Ladle into bowls and garnish each bowl with 3 clams in the shell and a sprinkling of fresh tarragon. Serve immediately.'

Transfer to a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let steam and soften for 15 minutes. Keep the grill at high heat.While the peppers steam, smash the garlic cloves, sprinkle with salt, and use the blade of your knife to work the garlic to a puree. Transfer to a bowl and add the olive oil, vinegar, basil, parsley and salt and pepper. Peel, seed and dice the peppers and add them to the bowl. Taste and season as needed. Let the relish sit at room temperature while you cook the broccoli rabe.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli rabe, cook for 2 minutes, then immediately plunge it into an ice water bath. Drain until almost dry but still slightly damp (a little bit of water helps the rabe steam on the grill). Brush the rabe with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the broccoli rabe until crisp-tender and slightly charred on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a platter, top with the pepper relish and drizzle with a bit of olive oil.'

S'For the pickled habanero onions: Combine 1/2 cup water, the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, salt and habanero chile in a medium saucepan. Boil the vinegar mixture until the sugar is dissolved. Remove the saucepan from the heat and cool for 5 minutes.Put the onion slices in a small bowl. Pour the warm vinegar mixture over the onions and toss to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 48 hours, stirring the mixture a few times.Meanwhile, for the mole: Heat the oil in a saucepan until it begins to shimmer. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, about 30 seconds. Stir in the chicken stock, pureed tomatoes, chipotle, molasses, honey, maple syrup, ancho chile powder, New Mexico chile powder, cinnamon, allspice, chile de arbol and ground cloves. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bring the mole to a simmer and cook, about 5 minutes. Add the almonds, chips, mangoes and raisins. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mangoes are soft and the mixture is reduced by half, about 30 minutes.Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the mixture to the saucepan over high heat. Add the chocolate and cook until reduced to a sauce consistency, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.For the burgers: Preheat the grill to high for direct heat. Divide the ground meat into 4 equal portions, 6 ounces each. Form each portion into a 3/4-inch burger. Make a deep impression in the center of each burger, using your thumb. Brush the burgers on both sides with the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.Grill the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on both sides and cooked to medium doneness, about 8 minutes. About a minute before removing the burgers from the gill, top with the Manchego and cover the grill.Transfer the burgers to the buns and top with a large dollop of the mole sauce, a few slices of avocado and some of the pickled habanero onions.'

S'For the turkey: Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 1 hour before roasting.Combine the butter, parsley, rosemary, sage and thyme and in a food processor and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Sprinkle the cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper and fill the cavity with half the carrots, celery and onions. Rub the entire turkey with the herb butter and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper.Put 4 cups of the chicken stock in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat.Place the remaining vegetables on the bottom of a large roasting pan. Put the turkey on top of the vegetables, put in the oven and roast until lightly golden brown, about 45 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue roasting, basting with the warm chicken stock every 15 minutes, 2 to 2 hours 15 minutes hours longer. (An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh should register 160 degrees F.)Remove the turkey from the oven, transfer to baking sheet, tent loosely with foil and let rest 30 minutes before slicing. Remove the legs for braising. Strain the drippings into a bowl and discard the solids. Add enough stock to make 4 cups liquid.Bring the liquid to a simmer, transfer to a roasting pan, add the legs, cover with foil and braise until tender in a 350 F degree oven about 1 hour.For the gravy: Melt the butter in a medium pan over high heat. Add the roasted garlic and cook for a minute. Whisk in the flour and cook until lightly golden brown. Slowly whisk the drippings into the flour mixture, bring to a boil and whisk until the mixture begins to thicken and the flour taste has been cooked out, about 5 minutes. Add a splash of the white wine if desired and cook for 1 minute longer. Fold in fresh herbs if desired and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.'

S'For the remoulade: Whisk together the mustard, horseradish, paprika, yolk, lemon juice and zest and some salt and black pepper in a medium bowl. Gradually add the oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking constantly, until all the oil is incorporated and emulsified. Stir in the celery, onions, ketchup, vinegar, parsley, Worcestershire, garlic and hot sauce to taste. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours to allow the flavors to meld.For the fried green tomatoes: Put the cornmeal in a large shallow bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper on both sides. Dredge the tomatoes in the cornmeal on both sides and tap off excess.Heat 1/2 cup of the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat until it begins to shimmer.  Fry half of the tomatoes until golden brown on both sides and just cooked through, about 1 minute 30 seconds per side.  Transfer with a slotted spatula to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Season with salt and repeat with the remaining tomatoes and oil.For the shrimp: Combine the celery seeds, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper in a mortar and pestle and crush into a somewhat fine powder. Toss the shrimp with the spice mixture.Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the shrimp and cook until crusty and just cooked through, about 3 minutes (do this in batches if necessary with more oil; the shrimp should be in a single layer).For assembly: Toss lettuce with a few tablespoons of the remoulade and season with salt and pepper. Divide the lettuce among the tomatoes and top each tomato with 3 shrimp. Drizzle with more of the remoulade. Garnish with parsley leaves.'

S'Combine the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times. Scatter the butter and lard over the top of the flour and pulse until the mixture forms large crumbs.  Add the water, a few tablespoons at a time, and pulse until the dough just comes together.  Divide into 2 equal pieces, flatten each half into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until chilled through, at least 1 hour. On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 of the disks into a 16-inch round. (Reserve the other disk for another purpose. It will keep in the freezer, double wrapped in plastic wrap then single wrapped in foil for up to 4 months.) Fit the dough into a 2-inch deep-dish tart pan with a removable bottom, gently pressing it into the sides. Using a sharp knife, trim the dough evenly with the edge of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap; and chill until firm, about 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the tart pan on a baking sheet, line the dough with parchment and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove the weights and paper and continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Let cool slightly (not all the way) on a baking rack. Put the jalapenos, cilantro, garlic, pine nuts and oil in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse until the mixture has a pesto-like consistency; you want a bit of texture. Add the cheese and salt and pepper, to taste, and pulse a few times to distribute the cheese. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer.  Add the chorizo and cook until golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Let cool slightly. Scatter the fontina, Cotija, green onions, chorizo and thyme over the warm tart shell.  Whisk the eggs in a large bowl.  Add the milk and cream and whisk until smooth.  Pour into the shell and evenly distribute the goat cheese over the top.  Bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the center is almost set (still slightly jiggles) but the sides are set, about 40 to 50 minutes. Let sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before serving. Cut into wedges and drizzle jalapeno pesto over the top.'

S'Make the ginger syrup: Combine the granulated sugar, fresh ginger and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the sugar has melted and the mixture thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let infuse for 30 minutes. Strain the syrup before using.Meanwhile, make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners and spray the liners with cooking spray.Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ground ginger, cinnamon and cloves into a medium bowl.Whisk the melted butter, vegetable oil, brown sugar, eggs, molasses and 3/4 cup water in a large bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth.Fill each paper liner with  cup batter, about 1/4 inch below the top of the liner. Bake just until the tops feel firm and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops liberally with the ginger syrup. Let sit in the pan for 5 minutes before removing. Let the cupcakes cool completely on a wire rack before frosting.Make the buttercream: Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the mangoes and cook until caramelized and soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a food processor and process until smooth. Pass the mixture through a medium-mesh strainer into a bowl. Discard the solids.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks on high speed until creamy and pale yellow, about 5 minutes.Spray a heatproof measuring cup with cooking spray. Combine the sugar and corn syrup in a saucepan and bring to a full rolling boil over medium-high heat. Cook without stirring until the syrup reaches the soft-ball stage, 238 degrees F to 242 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Immediately pour the syrup into the measuring cup to halt the cooking.Add a small amount of the sugar syrup to the beaten egg yolks, turn the mixer on to high speed and beat for about 5 seconds. Continue stopping the mixer, adding syrup and beating until all of the syrup is incorporated. Beat the mixture until it is completely cool.Add the remaining 2 cups butter, a few pieces at a time, beating until incorporated before adding more. When all of the butter has been blended in, add the vanilla and the mango puree and beat until combined.Frost the top of each cupcake liberally with the mango buttercream and garnish with the candied ginger.Photograph by Yunhee Kim'

S'Put the balsamic vinegar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to 1 cup. Set aside.Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Add the onions and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ketchup and the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the reduced vinegar and the remaining ingredients and simmer until thickened, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender until smooth and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Pour into a bowl and allow to cool at room temperature. Sauce will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator stored in a tightly sealed container. Heat the grill to high. Brush the flank steak with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Grill until golden brown on the 1 side, about 4 minutes, turn over and grill until the other side is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Move to a cooler part of the grill away from direct heat. Baste with the sauce and turn several more times until cooked to medium-rare doneness, about 15 minutes longer. Remove from the grill to a cutting board and loosely tent with foil. Let rest 10 minutes before cutting against the grain into thin slices. Put the bread on the grill, brush both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill the bread then remove from the grill. Top with mounds of grated Monterey jack cheese. Put the bread slices on a piece of aluminum foil and return to the grill to melt the cheese. Transfer to a serving platter.Arrange the flank steak slices on the bread and garnish with sliced scallions before serving.'

S'For the toasted ciabatta: Drizzle the cut sides of the ciabatta with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Put on a baking sheet cut-side up and bake until lightly golden brown, about 15 minutes.For the pesto: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the jalapenos in a few tablespoons of canola oil and sprinkle with salt. Roast in an even layer on a baking sheet until soft and the skin is blistered. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for 15 minutes, and then remove the stems and seeds. Combine the roasted jalapenos, parsley, Parmesan, pine nuts, garlic and some salt and pepper in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil through the feed tube until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add a few more teaspoons of oil and pulse. Transfer to a bowl.For the scrambled eggs: Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Cook the sopressata and the onions until the sopressata is crisp and the onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Whisk the eggs in a bowl until light and fluffy and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture into the pan with the onions and sopressata and cook, stirring constantly until soft curds form. Right before you pull the pan off the heat, when the eggs are almost done but not quite, add the provolone and stir for a few seconds to melt.To serve, mound the eggs on the top of the toasted ciabatta halves. Top with parsley leave, and cut on a slight angle into 8 large slices. Serve immediately.'

S'Combine flour and salt in an electric mixer for 30 seconds. In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, and 3 cups of water. Put electric mixer on a slow speed and add sour cream and egg mixture to the flour mixture. Mix for about 2 1/2 minutes. At this point check the dough and make sure it is creamy and pliable, if it is too sticky, add a bit of flour, if it is not pliable add more water. When dough reaches desired texture, remove from the mixer and let rest on a floured table, covered with plastic wrap, for about 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, begin working the dough with a floured rolling pin. Roll dough out to a rectangular shape that is 1 to 1 1/2-inches thick. Cut this into quarters. Take 1 sheet and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness. If dough begins to stick, sprinkle it with a bit of flour. Using a 2 to 3-inch cookie cutter, cut dough into circles.Once circles are cut, roll the circles to 1/8-inch. Place 1 tablespoon of the desired filling in the center of each circle. Lightly wet 1/2 of the edge of the circle with water, fold over and crimp together.Gently place pierogi into hot salted water that is just under boiling point, about 190 degrees F, and cook for 3 minutes or until pierogi float. Drain.Melt butter in a large frying pan. Add pierogis and cook until golden brown. Serve with Sauteed onions, a dollop of sour cream and chopped chives.'

S'For the bangers: Put the cumin and fennel seeds in a small saute pan and toast over low heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer the seeds to a spice grinder and grind to a powder.Put the pork chunks through a sausage grinder into a bowl. Add the ground cumin and fennel and the chiles, sprinkle with salt and pepper and mix together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours to allow the flavors to meld.Divide the pork mixture into sixteen 3-inch patties, each about 3 ounces. Wrap each patty in caul fat.Heat 2 tablespoons of canola oil in a large nonstick saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Sear half of the patties on both sides until golden brown and the sausage is cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining patties.For the kale pesto: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over low heat. Add the garlic and cook until lightly golden brown and soft; transfer the garlic to a food processor.Increase the heat to high, add the kale and a splash of water to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is soft. Transfer the kale to the food processor and add the parsley, Parmesan, green onions, the remaining 1/4 cup oil and some salt and pepper and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a bowl.For the mash: Put the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with cold water by 2 inches and add 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 25 minutes.For the beer-mustard gravy: While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until soft. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the beer and cook until completely reduced. Add the chicken stock, turn up the heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened and the flour taste has been cooked out, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, whisk in the honey and mustard and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.Preheat the broiler.To finish the mash, drain the potatoes well, return them to the pan and return the pan to the burner to dry them out for a minute. Run the potatoes through a food mill set over a large bowl. Add the warm cream and butter and mix until smooth. Fold in the mascarpone and season with salt and pepper. Add some of the kale pesto and marble in until swirled.To finish the bangers: Top each of the patties with some of the grated Cheddar and place under the broiler until melted and bubbly.Serve the bangers with the mash and beer-mustard gravy.'

S'Make the glaze: Whisk the maple syrup, mustard, horseradish and chile powder in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover and let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. (The glaze can be made up to 2 days in advance; store, covered, in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before using.)Prepare the turkey: Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 1 hour before roasting. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Season the cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper. Rub the outside of the turkey with the butter and season liberally with salt and pepper. Put 4 cups chicken stock in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat.Place the carrots, celery and onions in a large roasting pan and place a roasting rack on top. Put the turkey on the rack, place in the oven and roast until light golden brown, about 45 minutes. (Tent the turkey loosely with foil if it is browning too quickly.) Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, baste with 2 cups warm stock and continue roasting, basting with 2 more cups warm stock halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 155 degrees F, about 1 hour. After the turkey reaches 155 degrees F, begin basting with the maple glaze; continue roasting, basting with the glaze every 10 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 20 more minutes.Remove the turkey from the oven and transfer to a large cutting board. Tent loosely with foil and let rest at least 45 minutes before slicing. Strain the drippings into a bowl and discard the solids. Add enough of the remaining chicken stock to make 6 cups liquid.Make the gravy: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook until light golden brown, about 8 minutes. Slowly whisk in the stock-drippings mixture, then bring to a boil and whisk until the gravy begins thickening and the flour taste has been cooked out, about 10 minutes. Add more stock until you reach the desired consistency. If desired, add a splash of white wine and cook 2 more minutes. Stir in the herbs and season with salt and pepper.To serve, reheat the remaining stock in a saucepan over low heat. Remove the legs and wings, then remove the dark meat and shred. Remove the breasts and cut crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices. Place the meat on a platter and ladle some of the warm stock on top."Maple syrup is one of America\\\'s great natural sweeteners.

S'For the brine and pork: Bring 12 cups water, the salt, brown sugar, thyme, allspice, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon sticks, ginger, bay leaves, garlic and onions to a simmer in a large stockpot and cook until the sugar and salt is dissolved. Let cool completely.Submerge the pork in the brine by placing a plate on top, cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.Remove the pork from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Place on a rack set over a baking sheet in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.For the spice mixture: Combine the coriander, ginger, brown sugar, garlic powder, habanero powder, onion powder, black pepper, thyme, allspice, cinnamon and cloves in a small bowl. Brush the pork rack with the canola oil and rub with the spice mixture.Prepare the ceramic cooker: Add the hot charcoal to the cooker, and put on the grill rack. When the grill rack is hot, put on the pork fat-side down and cook until slightly charred. Now remove the pork and the grill rack, scatter the soaked wood chips over the hot charcoal, put on the ceramic plate and the grill rack and return the pork to the grill rack seared-side up. Close the cooker and adjust it to maintain a temperature of 325 degrees F. Cook the pork until a meat thermometer registers 140 degrees F, 75 to 90 minutes. Rest 10 minutes before carving into chops.'

S"For the trout: Combine 4 cups water, the salt and sugar in a 4-quart container and stir until the salt dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the trout, making sure they are submerged. Cover the container and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.Remove the trout from the brine, rinse thoroughly with cold water and pat dry. Place the trout skin-side down on a rack set in a half baking sheet. Place the rack in the refrigerator for drying, 21 to 24 hours or until the trout skin becomes shiny and somewhat tacky to the touch.Prepare the smoker using pecan or apple wood chips so that it maintains a temperature of 190 degrees F. Place the trout onto the smoking racks, skin-side down, separating them by at least 1/4-inch. Place the smoking racks in the smoker. Adjust the heat as needed and cook until the trout is cooked through, has darkened in color and has the desired level of smoke flavor, about 20 minutes. Remove the flesh from the bones of the trout and flake the trout into medium pieces.For the Meyer lemon dressing: Whisk the lemon juice, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, honey, zest and sprinkle with salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified.For the assembly: Place several pieces of the trout into individual lettuce leaves, drizzle with some of the Meyer lemon dressing and top with the carrots and parsley. Roll the lettuce leaves and eat.Cook\\'s Note: If Meyer lemons are not available, substitute 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice plus 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice."

S'About 2 hours before you plan to form the tamales, clean the husks under running water. Soak them in warm water for 2 hours, or until softened.Puree the corn, onion, roasted garlic, and stock in a food processor. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and cut in the butter and shortening. Using your fingers, mix in the cornmeal, honey, and salt and pepper until there are no visible lumps of fat. Fold in the sweet potato puree, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and maple syrup. The mixture will be a lot looser than you think it should be, but when the tamales are steamed it will dry out.Remove the cornhusks from the water and set aside the best 20 husks. Drain and pat dry. Tear the remaining husks into 1-inch wide strips to be used for tying. Lay 2 husks flat on a work surface, with the tapered ends facing out and the broad bases overlapping by about 3 inches. Place about 1/3 cup of masa mixture in the center. Bring the long sides up over the masa, slightly overlapping, and pat down to close. (If the masa drips out a little at the seam, that is no problem.) Tie each end of the bundle with a strip of cornhusk, pushing the filling toward the middle as you tie. Trim the ends to about 1/2-inch beyond the tie. Arrange the tamales in a single layer on a steaming rack, cover tightly with foil, and steam over boiling water for 45 minutes. To Serve: slice a slit on top of each tamale and push both ends of the tamale toward the middle to expose the masa. Top each with 1 tablespoon of Pecan Butter.'

Brush the steak on the side facing up with 2 tablespoons of the oil and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the cheese mixture evenly over the steak, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the sides. Starting with the long end, tightly roll the meat up like a jelly roll and tightly tie with the butcher\\'s twine on the ends and in the center. Brush the entire outside of the steak with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill, seam-side up and grill until golden brown on all sides, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the grill and let rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve several slices per person topped with some of the relish."

S"Special equipment: Good quality waffle iron with adjustable settings and that turns upside down, preferably cast iron.Put the flour in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook. Whisk together the eggs, and then add the milk, vanilla extract, vanilla seeds and honey in a large bowl. Add the mixture to the flour and mix for 1 minute. Add the yeast and continue to mix until the dough becomes smooth, about 5 minutes.Begin adding the butter, at low speed, piece by piece and continue mixing until it\\'s incorporated into the dough. Add the salt, increase the speed to high and continue mixing until the dough becomes a shiny solid mass and totally pulls away from the bottom and sides of the bowl, 10 to 15 minutes. The dough needs to be very elastic, you shouldn\\'t be able to break the dough when pulled. Add the sugar and mix until it is just incorporated, about 1 minute.Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 48 even pieces, roll into balls, place on the parchment, cover with clean cotton towels and let rise in a warm area until almost tripled in size, anywhere from 1 1/2 to 3 hours.Heat the waffle iron to 400 degrees F. Lightly spray the waffle iron with nonstick spray or brush with melted butter. Cook the waffles until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side."

S'To make Irish Whiskey Rack Sauce, combine the oil, garlic, rosemary, and lemon in a frying pan. Heat on high flame (do not brown garlic). Pull pan away from flame. Add whiskey, return to flame, and add salt and pepper. Add the demi-glace and brown gravy. Let reduce and add the butter in slowly, off the heat to thicken the sauce. Keep warm.Clean rack thoroughly (remove all silver skin). Season lightly with salt and pepper. Place sizzle pan upside down on the grill. Put lamb, meat-side-down next to the sizzle pan with the bones resting on the pan. This will keep the bones from burning. Make the cross-brand mark on the meat side, then turn and cook for a few minutes on the bone side. Finish in oven, if you prefer well done.When presenting, cut the lamb into 2 pieces. Stand up and cross the bones as if to build a tee-pee. Top with Irish Whiskey Rack Sauce.This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.

S'For the caramel sauce: Combine the cream, apple juice, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, ginger and nutmeg in a medium saucepan, and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and let steep for at least 20 minutes. Set aside and keep warm while you make the caramel.Combine the sugar, 1/2 cup water, and the cider vinegar in a medium saucepan over high heat, and cook without stirring until it reaches a deep amber color, about 8 minutes. Slowly strain in the warm cream, whisking constantly; continue whisking until smooth. (Be careful! The caramel will bubble up as you add the cream.)  Whisk in the apple schnapps and cook for 30 seconds longer. Transfer to a bowl and keep warm. (The sauce can be made 2 days in advance and refrigerated. Reheat over low heat before serving.)For the pancakes: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Place a baking sheet with a rack in the oven to heat.Whisk together the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger in a large bowl.In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, ricotta, pumpkin and 2 tablespoons melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and whisk until just combined; do not overmix. Let the batter sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.Heat a large nonstick pan or griddle over medium-low heat. Brush with melted butter or spray with nonstick spray. Drop a scant 1/4 cup of the batter onto the pan; cook until small bubbles form on the surface and at the edges and the bottom is lightly golden brown, about 3 minutes. (Adjust the heat if the bottom browns too quickly.) Flip, and continue cooking until golden brown on the reverse side, another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove to the rack in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter.Serve the pancakes with a drizzle of caramel sauce and a dollop of creme fraiche.'

S'For the casserole: Heat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat. Brush the eggplant with canola oil on both sides and season with salt and pepper. Grill until lightly golden brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.Combine the peppers, pine nuts, garlic, and thyme in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped. With the motor running, slowly the cup olive oil and process until emulsified. Add 1/4 cup Parmesan and some salt and pepper and pulse a few times to incorporate.Spoon about 1/2 cup of the pesto over the bottom of a baking dish. Line the dish with the some eggplant slices and then the mozzarella slices. Season with salt and pepper and scatter the oregano leaves over the top. Dollop another 1/2 cup or so of the pesto over, then more eggplant, a bit more pesto and finally the remaining Parmesan. Put on the grill, cover and bake until the cheese is melted and the casserole is hot, about 20 minutes.For the breadcrumbs: Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the paprika and cayenne and cook for 30 seconds. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring occasionally, until the crumbs are lightly golden brown. Add the parsley and thyme and season with salt and pepper.While the casserole cooks, make the breadcrumbs: Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet over hot coals or over medium heat. Stir in the breadcrumbs (about 2 cups) and the spice rub and toast, stirring, until the crumbs are golden brown and crisp. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley, and scatter over the casserole. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.'

S"Heat a grill to medium-low heat. Grill the chiles until blistered and softened all over.Remove the rind from the pineapple and slice into1-inch-thick rounds. Brush the pineapple slices with canola oil and sprinkle with a little sugar. Grill until caramelized on all sides and just soft, about 10 minutes total. Remove and let cool slightly.Roughly chop half of the pineapple slices and 1 of the chiles. Put in a food processor with the butter and process until almost smooth. Add 2 of the green onions and the chile de arbol and pulse just to combine. Taste. If the pineapple isn\\'t very sweet, add some honey and pulse just to combine. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until firm and the flavors meld, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Let it warm slightly before grilling the fish.Finely dice the remaining pineapple and chile. Put them in a bowl with the remaining green onions, the olive oil, lime juice and some salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Set aside while you grill the fish.Increase the heat of the grill to high. Brush the fish with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill, flesh-side down, until charred and you can move it with a fish spatula without the flesh sticking to the grill, about 3 minutes. Flip, and smear some of the pineapple butter on the flesh side. Grill the second side until charred, about 3 minutes.Transfer to a platter, smear on a bit more of the butter mixture, top with the pineapple relish and serve immediately."

S"Cook\\'s Note: Select designates 12 to 15 crawfish per pound; True Select designates 12 crawfish or less per pound.Add the crawfish to a large pot of salted boiling water. Cook for about 30 seconds. Shock the crawfish in a bowl filled with ice water.Cut through the shell on the belly side the entire length of the crawfish. This will help the meat cook evenly. Remove the vein along the body as well as the sack behind the eyes. Rinse thoroughly.Combine the butter, hot sauce, tarragon and cayenne in a food processor. Process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.Prepare a charcoal grill for direct grilling. Place the crawfish in a grill basket and grill until the shell turns bright red and the meat is opaque, about 5 minutes, shaking the grill basket occasionally.Meanwhile, melt the spicy tarragon butter in a saucepan or skillet. Remove the crawfish to a large platter or shallow bowl, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with the melted butter. Serve immediately."

S"For the scones: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger and salt in a large bowl. Cut the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal.Whisk together the buttermilk, pumpkin and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. Add the wet mixture to the dry along with the cranberries and candied ginger. Mix until it is all just combined (do not over-mix or the scones will be tough).Transfer to a lightly-floured surface and knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. Pat the dough into a circle that is about 8 inches round and about 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut the circle in half, and then cut each half into 4 pie-shaped wedges (triangles). Place the scones on the baking sheet and brush the tops with the heavy cream.Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool on a baking rack for 15 minutes before serving.For the butter: Meanwhile, combine the cream, maple syrup and sea salt in the chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on low speed at first, then once the mixture begins to thicken, increase the speed and whip until light and fluffy and has turned into butter. Don\\'t over-mix the butter or it will break."

S'Roasted Garlic Oil: Place oil and garlic in a blender and blend until smooth. Strain.Flatbread: Mix water and yeast in a large bowl and let stand 5 minutes to proof. Gradually pour in 2 cups of the flour and stir to incorporate. Mix for about 1 minute to form a sponge. Let stand, covered, for at least an hour. Put sponge in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook, add the salt and oil, then add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a dough. Remove from bowl and knead. Place in a clean oiled bowl and let rise, slowly, about 2 1/2 hours. Divide dough into 4 balls, if desired, let rise again for 1/2 hour, and then roll out as desired.Flatten flatbread dough, gently press into a large rectangle, brush liberally with olive oil, and throw on grill. Grill on both sides until golden brown. Spread 1 side with ricotta, sprinkle with salt and pepper, scatter tomatoes over, drizzle with Roasted Garlic Oil, and garnish with basil and more freshly ground black pepper. Serve immediately. Yield: 4 individual flatbreads or 1 large flatbread'

Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and mix until just combined (can be lumpy). Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.Place a nonstick griddle or nonstick frying pan over medium heat and brush with oil or melted butter. Pour the batter in scant 1/4 cup portions onto the griddle and cook until pancakes are browned on the bottom and the edges begin to look dry, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn over with a spatula and cook another 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Repeat. Serve immediately topped with the roasted apples and more maple syrup if desired.'

S'For the croutons: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, and spray with nonstick spray.Toss the oats with the quinoa, almonds, pumpkin seeds and salt in a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup coconut oil (if it has hardened in the jar, melt it in the microwave or on the stove over low heat) and agave. Toss until the mixture forms clumps; if it seems dry, add more coconut oil, 1 tablespoon at a time.Spread the crouton mixture onto the prepared baking sheet in a thin, even layer. Bake on the middle oven rack until light golden brown, about 45 minutes--it will feel sticky when just out of the oven but will crisp up as it cools. Remove the baking sheet to a baking rack and let cool completely. Break into clusters. (Makes about 3 cups. Extra can be stored at room temperature in a tightly covered container for 3 days.)For the power bowl: Put the oats in a blender and blend until powder-like. Add the blueberries, banana, yogurt, pomegranate juice, honey, pomegranate molasses, lemon juice and orange zest. Blend until smooth.Transfer the mixture to a container with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate for at least 8 hour and up to 24 hours. (This will help create a smoother consistency as the oats will absorb some of the liquid and become thicker.)To serve, divide the power bowl mixture between 2 bowls. Top with a dollop of yogurt, a few blueberries, some pomegranate seeds if using, and some quinoa croutons.'

Add the shrimp to the marinade in the bowl and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes.While the shrimp marinates, whisk together the rice vinegar, soy sauce, canola and sesame oils, scallion and cilantro in a small bowl.Heat the grill to high. Remove the shrimp from the marinade, brush with canola oil, and season with salt and pepper. Skewer the shrimp and grill for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until just cooked through.Toss the spinach with some of the vinaigrette and mound in the center of a serving platter. Arrange shrimp around spinach and spoon over more of the dressing. Scatter the peanuts over the salad and shrimp.For the New-Style Scampi:Add the butter and red pepper flakes to the marinade in the food processor, and pulse until combined. Scrape the mixture into a small saucepan and put on the grill just to melt the butter.Trim the ends from the limes and halve. Brush with canola oil, season with salt and pepper, and grill, flesh side down, until marked and slightly softened, 4 to 5 minutes.Skewer the remaining shrimp, brush with canola oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until just cooked through. Slide the shrimp from the skewers into a shallow bowl, pour over some butter sauce, and toss to coat. Scatter the cilantro over the top, and arrange the grilled limes around the shrimp.'

S'For the caramelized onions: Melt the butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, over low heat until soft and caramelized, about 30 minutes. Stir in a few tablespoons of vinegar and cook for 1 minute longer. Add the thyme and season with salt and pepper.For the buckwheat crepes: Combine the milk, 3/4 cup water, the flours, oil, salt, pepper and eggs in a blender and blend until smooth. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours and up to 8 hours. The longer it sits, the more tender the crepes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Brush a crepe pan or 8- to 10-inch nonstick pan with some of the melted butter and heat over medium heat until it begins to sizzle. Lift the pan at a slight angle and pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the center, tilting the pan to spread the batter to the edges. Return the pan to the heat and cook until the crepe is golden underneath, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a spatula, flip the crepe over and cook until golden on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and cover. Repeat with more butter as needed and the remaining batter.For assembling the crepes: Return a crepe to the warm pan. Spread some onions over the surface, scatter some grated cheese over the onions, and tear a ham slice and drop across the surface. Fold the crepe in half, then in half again to make a triangle, and heat through to melt the cheese. Serve.'

S"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the chile on a rimmed baking sheet, rub with 1 tablespoon of the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until the skin of the chile is blackened, about 15 minutes. Remove the chile from the oven, place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let the chile steam for 15 minutes. Peel, stem, and seed the chile and then coarsely chop it.To make the queso sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the milk, increase the heat to high, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Divide the meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with salt and pepper. Cook the burgers, using the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. See how Bobby cooks perfect burgersPlace the burgers on the bun bottoms and top each with a few tablespoons of queso sauce, chips, and some of the poblano. Cover with the bun tops and serve immediately.Toasted Burger BunsI think the taste and the texture of buns are best when lightly toasted. To toast a bun on a grill, grill pan, or griddle, split the bun open, place it cut side down on the grill, and grill until light golden brown, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, you can place the split bun halves cut side up on a baking sheet and cook them under a preheated broiler until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Keep a close eye on them and don\\'t let them get too brown or else that texture will take on a life of its own and defeat the purpose of starting with a soft bun."

Add the yogurt, mint, cumin and hot pepper sauce to the work bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Place the lamb on a large baking sheet and rub the entire leg with the yogurt mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat the grill to high. Remove the lamb from the marinade and season well with salt and pepper. Place the lamb, skin side down, on the grill. Grill until the skin side is golden brown, then turn the lamb over, and reduce the heat of the grill to medium so that the grill maintains a constant temperature of 350 degrees F. Continue grilling until a thermometer inserted deep into the meat reaches a temperature of 145 degrees F for medium-rare doneness, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove lamb from grill, cover with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice the meat on the bias into 1/4-inch thick slices.'

S'To make the cinnamon crunch, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Combine the flour, oats, muscovado sugar, and cinnamon in a food processor, and process a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse until combined. Pat the mixture evenly into a 4-inch square on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove and let cool. Transfer to a cutting board and chop into small pieces. Keep the oven on.To make the crust, combine the graham cracker crumbs, butter, and cinnamon in a bowl and mix until combined. Press evenly onto the bottom and sides of a 10-inch pie plate. Brush with the beaten egg. Bake until light golden brown and firm, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F.To make the filling, whisk the eggs, egg yolks, both sugars, and the molasses together in a medium bowl. Mix in the pumpkin puree, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Whisk in the heavy cream, milk, and vanilla seeds or extract. Strain the mixture through a coarse strainer into a bowl. Whisk in the butter.Place the pie plate on a baking sheet, pour the pumpkin mixture into the shell, and sprinkle additional cinnamon over the top. Bake until the filling is set around edges but the center still jiggles slightly when shaken, 45 to 60 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.Cut the pie into slices and top each with a large dollop of whipped cream and some of the cinnamon crunch.'

S"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. In a bowl combine the dry ingredients and blend thoroughly. Cream in the butter with your fingers or a fork, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the buttermilk a little at a time and, using your hands or a fork, work it in just until it\\'s thoroughly incorporated and you have a smooth ball of dough. Don\\'t overwork or over-handle the dough. On a lightly floured surface, press the dough out into a round that is about 1-inch thick. Using a round cookie cutter or the rim of a drinking glass, press out (2 1/2-inch) rounds; you should get about 7 biscuits. If you like, you can re-roll the leftover dough to make more, but the texture of these will be denser than the others. Place the dough rounds on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with heavy cream. Grind fresh pepper over top of biscuits, if desired. Bake until golden on top and brown on the bottom, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve warm with butter and a drizzle of honey."

S'Heat olive oil in a large saucepan on the grates of the grill. Add the onions and garlic and cook until soft. Add chickpeas, stock and salt and pepper and cook until chickpeas are very soft. *Transfer mixture carefully, in batches, to a blender and blend until smooth.  Return the mixture to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Slowly whisk in the polenta, stirring constantly, and continue whisking until mixture begins to bubble. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture is thickened and cooked, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Spread the mixture into a baking sheet, cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator until cold and very firm, about 4 hours. When the polenta is firm, remove from the refrigerator and, using a 2-inch ring mold, cut out circles of the polenta. Preheat a grill to medium-high. Season the polenta circles with salt and pepper on both sides, brush with oil and grill on both sides until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from grill, drizzle with chive oil and garnish with lemon zest and chives.'

S'For the soda bread: Put the raisins in a bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain and pat dry.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Sift the all-purpose, cake and semolina flours, and the baking soda, cream of tartar and salt into a large bowl; stir in the sugar. Cut the 3 tablespoons butter into the flour until it resembles a coarse meal. Stir in the fennel seeds and the soaked raisins.In a small bowl, stir the orange zest into the buttermilk, and then add to the flour mixture, stirring with a fork just until a dough comes together. Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead briefly until the loose flour is just moistened; the dough should look shaggy and uneven.Form the dough into a 6-inch round and place in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Using a very sharp knife, score a deep cross into the top of the loaf. Bake until nicely browned and a skewer inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with the 2 tablespoons melted butter. Cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing.While the bread bakes, make the buttermilk-orange butter: Whisk together the buttermilk and orange zest in a small bowl. Put the butter and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until smooth. Slowly pour in the buttermilk mixture and continue beating until just incorporated. Spread into a ramekin, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours to allow the flavors to meld.Serve slices of warm or toasted semolina soda bread with the orange butter.'

Add the cooled reduced rum and the rum extract and add more powdered sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, and whip until slightly thick, spreadable consistency.For the cupcakes: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fill mini muffin tins with liners and spray the liners with nonstick spray.Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg together in large bowl. Whisk together the melted butter, buttermilk, oil, vanilla, rum extract, and yolks in a medium bowl.In a clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites at medium-high speed until foamy, about 30 seconds. With the machine running, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar; continue to beat until stiff peaks just form, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer to a separate bowl and set aside. Wash the bowl and dry.Add the flour mixture to the now-empty mixing bowl fitted with whisk attachment. With mixer running at low speed, gradually pour in the butter mixture and mix until almost incorporated (a few streaks of dry flour will remain), about 15 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape the whisk and sides of the bowl. Return the mixer to medium-low speed and beat until smooth and fully incorporated, 10 to 15 seconds.Using a rubber spatula, stir 1/3 of the whites into the batter to lighten, and then add the remaining whites and gently fold into the batter until no white streaks remain. Quickly fold in the reserved raisins.Fill the cupcake molds 7/8 full and bake until just firm, about 10 minutes. Let cool in the pan set on a baking rack for 5 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the tins and let cool completely on the racks. Frost with the rum raisin buttercream.'

Sprinkle the salt, garlic salt, black pepper, red chile flakes, crab boil seasoning, chopped celery, and chopped onions. Using your hands, combine all the ingredients together into a homogenized mixture. Set aside so the flavors blend.In another large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, crab meat, and crab sauce. Mix into a homogenous blend. Take a small handful of the bread mixture and using your thumb or finger, press out a hole. Take a small scoop, about 1 1/2 ounces, of the crab mixture and place it into the hole. Bring the bread mixture around the crab mixture, forming a patty. Set aside on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, or a large platter. Continue making patties until all of the mixtures are used. In a large skillet, pour 1 1/2 inches of oil into the pan. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F., or until a small piece of the bread mixture sizzles and bubbles when placed in the oil. Place patties in the pan, being careful not to crowd them. Fry until golden on 1 side, about 3 to 4 minutes, and then flip over and fry until golden on the other side.

When cool enough to handle, slice each potato in half lengthwise then slice each half into 1/4-inch thick slicesPreheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Season pork on both sides with salt and pepper, place into the pan and cook until golden brown and a crust has formed, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the tenderloin over and transfer the pan to the oven and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the tenderloin registers 150 degrees F. Remove from the oven and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Slice the tenderloin half lengthwise then slice each half crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices.Place 1 slice of pork onto a large platter, top with a potato, then a piece of the goat cheese then another slice of pork, then stick a skewer through. Drizzle with some of the Smoked Paprika vinaigrette. Sprinkle each with a little more of the smoked paprika and some of the chopped parsley.'

Add the ginger and garlic and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the mustard seeds and cook for 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup water, the lime zest and juice and some salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Transfer to a blender and blend until a smooth paste, adding more water if needed. Let cool.Rub the paste over the entire chicken, including under the skin. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling.Light a chimney starter filled with hardwood charcoal and allow to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a layer of fine gray ash. Build a single-level fire by spreading the coals evenly over the bottom of the grill. Add the soaked spices evenly over the hot charcoal, put the lid on the grill and allow the grates to heat up and the smoke to fill the grill, about 5 minutes.Place the chicken, skin-side down, over the coals and cook until the skin is nicely charred. Flip, move to indirect heat, cover the grill and cook at about 375 degrees until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 40 to 50 minutes.Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before carving.'

Let cool to room temperature before serving.For the chicken: Whisk together the buttermilk, chile powders, coriander, granulated garlic, onion powder, paprika and cinnamon in a large baking dish. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours, turning a few times.Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry.

S'Salt the cod very generously with kosher salt. Place in a perforated pan or colander and let sit, refrigerated, for 2 days.Add the herbs, spices onion and garlic cloves to the milk and heat for 5 minutes, do not let boil. Add the cod and poach until tender, around 5 to 7 minutes. Gently remove the cod with a slotted spoon. Remove any bones and skin. Meanwhile peel and chunk the potatoes. Cook in well-seasoned water or better still, use the milk the fish was poached in. When the potatoes are tender drain, and puree them, either in a ricer or a mixer using the paddle attachment. Pull out 1/3 of the potatoes and add the cod. Mix well, at medium speed if using a mixer, drizzling in the olive oil and a bit of the cooking liquid. Keep mixing and adding liquid until the desired consistency is reached. Pound the green garlic or 2 cloves of garlic to a fine paste in a mortar and pestle and stir into the puree. For an even more full flavored brandade, pass the onion, garlic, and aromatics through a food mill and stir some of this puree in as well. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed'

Knead dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour, as necessary, to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth about 5 to 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball.Lightly oil the sides and bottom of a large bowl with oil, add the dough, turn to coat in the oil, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Gently punch the dough down and divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 10-inch circle that is 1/8-inch thick. Brush off excess flour and transfer the dough to a baking sheet, cover each circle of dough with plastic wrap and continue stacking rolled out pieces on top of each other. Wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to grill.'

Add 1/2 cup of the warm cream to the yolks and whisk quickly to temper the egg mixture. Add in the remaining cream, a little at a time, whisking constantly. When all of the cream has been incorporated, strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl.Place 4 creme brulee ramekins into a 2-inch-deep baking pan. Evenly divide the custard between the ramekins, filling to the top. Carefully add the boiling water into the pan until it is halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover with aluminum foil.Carefully (so no water gets in the custard) place the baking pan into the oven and bake until the custard is set, 25 to 30 minutes.Remove the ramekins from the water bath and refrigerate.Combine the blackberries, mint, pomegranate seeds and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a medium bowl, and let sit 10 minutes.When the custards have cooled, sprinkle the tops with sugar and brulee with a torch until the sugar caramelizes.

Using the finest grater you have, lightly scrape the skin of 1 lemon, removing only the top surface of the peel. Squeeze out the juice and remove the seeds from both lemons. Open the Champagne or sparkling wine, and pour it into a 9 by 12 by 2-inch pan. Mix in the simple syrup, lemon juice, and grated zest. Place mixture into the freezer. Check after 30 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, break up any ice formed on the sides and stir into the rest of the liquid. Continue to freeze and repeat this procedure every hour for at least 3 hours. Before serving, fluff the granita by "chopping" up any clumps with the spoon or gently whisking the frozen mixture. Spoon into small glasses or cups and serve.'

S"Prepare the grill for direct and indirect cooking.Once the grill is hot (you can hold your hands an inch over the grates for no more than 2 seconds), stretch and shape the dough into a 12-inch round on a flat surface. Brush the top with oil and toss on the grill, oil-side down. Cook until the bottom is golden brown, 1 minute. Check the bottom of the dough to see if it is getting browned. If it is on one part, but not the other, use a spatula or tongs to rotate the dough 90 degrees and cook for another minute. If it is still not beginning to brown, cover the grill and continue to cook a minute at a time until the bottom has browned evenly. (It should only take a couple minutes if you have a hot grill.) The top of the pizza dough will also start bubbling up with air pockets.Once the pizza dough has browned on the bottom, flip over and grill until golden brown and the dough is just firm, another minute or so. Remove to a sheet pan. Cover the grill so it retains the heat for the next step.Combine the mascarpone cheese and honey. Smear the mascarpone over the pizza and scatter the plum wedges and berries on top. Put the pizza on the sheet pan back on the grill, close the cover and cook just to warm the fruit, about 2 minutes. Dust with confectioners\\' sugar and serve immediately."

Spread the pecans in an even layer onto a baking sheet and toast in the oven, stirring once, until lightly golden brown and just fragrant, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a baking rack and let cool slightly before coarsely chopping.Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over high heat until it begins to turn light golden brown. Whisk in both of the sugars and cook until smooth. Take the pot off the heat and add the flour, cardamom, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg and mix until clumps begin to form. Refrigerate the crumb mixture for 15 minutes.For the cake: Heavily butter a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Whisk together  the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the melted butter, milk, canola oil, orange zest, vanilla and eggs. Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking pan, smoothing out the surface. Scatter the crumbs in large clumps over the cake; the crumb layer should be quite deep.Bake until the crumbs are golden and firm and a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 55 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool.For the glaze: Whisk together the sugar, butter, juice, zest and vanilla.Once the cake is cool, drizzle the glaze over it and cut into 9 pieces. Serve on a platter.'

Place the breast on the grill, skin-side down, and grill until golden brown and a crust has formed, about 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat of the grill to medium, turn the breast over, close the cover of the grill and continue cooking until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 165 degrees F, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the breast from the grill and let rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10 minutes. Slice the breast into 1/4-inch thick slices.Lay the bacon, lengthwise, over the grates of the grill and grill for approximately 2 minutes per side or until golden brown and slightly crunchy. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels.Mix together the goat cheese, mayonnaise, and sage in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide the mayonnaise among 4 slices of the bread and top each with 4 slices of turkey, 2 green tomato slices, another slice of bread, 3 slices of bacon, some of the watercress, and top each with the remaining bread.'

S"For the shells: Combine the flour, cinnamon, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Work in the lard and slowly add the marsala. Knead together with fingers until the dough comes together. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Form the dough into a disk and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.Set the smooth rollers of a pasta maker at the widest setting. Unwrap the dough and cut in half. Lightly flour 1 half (keep the remaining half covered with plastic wrap). Flatten the floured dough into an oval and feed through the rollers. Turn the dial down 2 notches and feed the dough through the rollers again. Fold the dough back to its original oval shape and repeat the process of putting the dough through the pasta rollers. Continue to feed the dough through the rollers, making the space between the rollers narrower by 2 notches each time, until the dough reaches a thickness of roughly 1/8 inch.Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. Transfer the rolled dough to a lightly floured surface and cut out 4 or 5 rounds with a floured 4-inch round cutter. Transfer the rounds to a baking sheet and keep covered with more plastic wrap. Roll out the remaining dough and cut rounds in the same manner. Gather the scraps and let stand 10 minutes. Roll out the scraps and cut in the same manner.Heat several inches of oil in a large Dutch oven until it registers 350 degrees F. Lightly spray the cannoli tubes with nonstick spray.Brush the bottom edge of 1 dough round with the egg white. Wrap the dough around a tube, overlapping the ends (egg white edge should go on top), and then press the edges together to seal. Make 5 more shells in the same manner (keep remaining rounds covered with plastic).Fry the dough on the tubes one at a time, turning with metal tongs, until it is one shade darker, about 45 seconds. Wearing oven mitts, clamp the end of the hot tubes with tongs, 1 at a time, and, holding the tube vertically, allow the shell to slide off the tube onto paper towels, gently shaking the tube and wiggling the shell as needed to loosen. (If you allow the shell to cool it will stick to the tube and shatter when you try to remove it.) Transfer the shells to paper towels to drain and cool the tubes before reusing. Wrap the remaining dough around the tubes and fry in the same manner.For the filling: Combine the heavy cream and tangerine zest in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat.Combine the sugar and tangerine juice in a medium saucepan and cook until deep amber colored. Slowly whisk in the cream mixture and cook until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and let cool and thicken slightly.Combine the drained ricotta and cream cheese in the bowl of a mixer, add a few tablespoons of confectioners\\' sugar to sweeten, and beat until light and fluffy. Fold in the tangerine caramel sauce.Fill a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and fill the cannoli shells. Dip the ends in the almonds and chocolate and dust with confectioners\\' sugar."

Add the mango, peanuts, sesame seeds, ginger, allspice, and cloves and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often. Add the cinnamon, chiles, and stock, and season with salt and pepper; cook for 1 hour. Add the tortillas and cook for another hour.Remove cinnamon sticks and carefully ladle the hot mixture, in batches, into a blender* and blend until smooth. Strain the sauce through a fine mesh strainer into a clean saucepan and cook until slightly thickened.*When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.Yield: approximately 9 cups'

S'Place the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, egg yolks, lemon juice and zest in a food processor or blender and process until smooth.  Slowly add the oil, drop by drop at first, until thickened.  Season with salt and white pepper, to taste.  Refrigerate until ready to use.For the paella:Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Place the tomatoes in a small baking dish and drizzle with the honey, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and salt and pepper, and roast until soft.  Set aside.Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan and add a large pinch of saffron. Put about 1/2 cup of the stock in another saucepan, add the clams, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook just until the clams open; remove the clams from the liquid and set aside, reserving the liquid.Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a very large skillet or paella pan over medium-high heat.  Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and add to the heated pan.  Cook until browned on all sides.  Remove the chicken pieces to a plate.  Add the chorizo, onion and garlic and saute until chorizo has browned and the onions are translucent.  Add the rice, about 7 1/2 cups of the chicken stock, the reserved clam liquid, and any juices from the chicken and bring to a simmer. Nestle the chicken in the rice and let cook, uncovered, until the rice is quite al dente, about 15 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer-the rice on the bottom of the pan should form a dark brown crispy crust by the end of the cooking time. If the stock is disappearing too quickly, just add a bit more of the remaining 2 cups. Add the mussels, shrimp, octopus, squid, and/or cuttlefish, and peas.  Cook until the shrimp are pink and the mussels open. Add the lobster, clams and roasted tomatoes and heat briefly. At this point, you should still be able to see liquid bubbling gently; it will settle when you turn off the heat.  Fold in the parsley and lemon aioli and mix until combined, season with salt and pepper, to taste.*RAW EGG WARNINGFood Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs. Due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.  To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell.'

Carefully place a second sheet of the pasta dough on top of the first and press with your fingertips to separate the rows of filling. Repeat with the remaining dough.With a ravioli cutter or pastry wheel, cut straight lines vertically and horizontally to form each ravioli square. Press the edges closed with your fingertips to seal well.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop in the ravioli and cook for about 5 minutes.

S"For the red chile tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a 12-inch high-sided saute pan over high heat. Cook the onions and jalapenos until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds, and then stir in the chili powder and coriander and cook 1 minute. Pour in 1 cup water and cook until reduced. Mix in the chipotles and tomatoes and bring a boil, and then reduce to a simmer and cook until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. Season with salt, black pepper and honey, if using. Whisk in the crema, followed by the cilantro, and adjust the seasoning, if needed.For the mexican meatballs: Grind the cubed meats using a hand-operated meat grinder fit with a medium dye. Combine the ground meats with the garlic and egg in a large bowl, and then add in 1/4 cup of the cilantro, the cheese, New Mexico chili powder, Mexican oregano, cumin and cayenne pepper. Gently mix together until combined. Begin mixing in the breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture holds together. Mix in some salt and black pepper, and form the meat into 2-inch balls.Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Cook the meatballs, turning occasionally, until brown all over, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock and cook until the liquid is mostly reduced and the meatballs are just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer to a serving platter and top with the Red Chile Tomato Sauce, queso fresco and additional cilantro leaves.Cook\\'s Note: For optimal meat grinding, the equipment must be kept as cold as possible until ready to use."

S"Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups flour and the salt, stirring until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups flour; continue adding flour (up to 1/2 cup), 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until the dough comes away from the bowl but is still sticky.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead with lightly floured hands. Start by slapping the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself (use a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape dough from surface). Repeat until it\\'s easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading normally until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in volume, about 3 hours.Press it with your finger to see if it\\'s done; an indent should remain. Gently remove the dough from the bowl and divide in half. Roll each half into a ball and put on a lightly floured baking sheet. Brush lightly with olive oil, cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rest 15 minutes.Prepare charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash). Add to the grill, creating a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, and leaving the other half with no coals.Stretch and shape each ball of dough into a rough 12-by-10-inch rectangle. Brush one side with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Turn onto the grill, oiled-side down, over direct heat. Brush the top with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until nicely charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip, close the lid and grill another 1 to 2 minutes.Transfer the pizza to a baking sheet that will fit on the covered grill. Spread half of the robiola over the top. Return the pizza on the baking sheet to the grill, cover and let warm a few minutes just to melt the cheese. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board. Scatter the shaved asparagus and then the Romano shavings over the top. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter the lemon zest over the top, then the parsley leaves and drizzle with olive oil.Repeat with the remaining dough and topping ingredients."

Put in the oven until the chips get hot and begin to smoke, about 15 minutes.Remove the pan from the oven and remove the foil from the pan.  Put a baking rack inside the pan and arrange the chops on top of the rack, leaving a few inches of space between each one.  Quickly cover with the foil again and let sit on your kitchen counter for 10 to 15 minutes.While the pork chops are smoking, put the vinegar in a small pan over high heat and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the maple syrup, allspice, and salt and pepper, to taste. Let cool slightly.Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the ridges with some of the canola oil.  Brush the chops on both sides with some of the glaze and season with salt and pepper.  Grill on both sides, brushing with more of the glaze, until golden brown and slightly charred and cooked to medium doneness, about 7 minutes per side.

Do not allow the mixture to boil after you add the pumpkin or the syrup will become cloudy (even after straining.)  Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool for 10 minutes.Place a mesh strainer over a medium bowl and line the strainer with several layers of cheesecloth. Pour the mixture through the strainer and let it strain slowly into the bowl. Add the vanilla extract to the syrup and transfer to a container with a tight fitting lid.  The syrup will last 1 month stored in the refrigerator. Makes about 1 1/2 cups; leftovers can be refrigerated for 1 week.'

S'For the pulled chicken: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Season the chicken with the ancho chile powder, salt and pepper. Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a medium high-sided ovenproof saute pan over high heat. Sear the chicken on both sides until golden brown. Add the chicken broth and barbecue sauce, bring to simmer, cover and cook in the oven until fork-tender, about 1 hour.Remove the chicken from the pan, loosely cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Reduce the cooking liquid in the pan over medium-high heat until about 1/2 cup remains. Shred the chicken with a fork into bite-size pieces. Return the chicken to the pan and toss to coat in the mixture. Reserve.For the chiles: Increase the oven to 375 degrees F. Toss the poblanos with the oil, salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet and roast, turning occasionally, until blackened and soft, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to steam. Once cool enough to handle, scrape off the skins. Make a long slash in one side of each poblano, from stem to tip. Carefully remove and discard the seeds. Reserve.For the tortillas: Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat the oil in a medium high-sided saute pan over medium heat until it begins to shimmer. Fry the 1/2-inch tortilla strips in batches, until just crisp, 20 to 30 seconds. Transfer with a slotted spoon to one side of the prepared baking sheet and season with salt. Fry the julienned tortillas and transfer with a slotted spoon to the other side of the baking sheet and season with salt. Reserve.For the cooked tomato salsa: Combine the tomatoes, jalapeno, garlic and 1/2 cup water in a blender and blend until smooth. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat until it just begins to shimmer. Add the pureed tomato mixture, oregano, salt and pepper and cook until the mixture thickens slightly and becomes a deep red, about 15 minutes. Reserve.For the migas-filled chile rellenos: Put the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until reduced by half; do not let it boil. Whisk in the cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm over very low heat.Melt the butter and oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the jalapeno and cook for 1 minute. Add the eggs, season with salt and pepper and stir with a heat-proof rubber spatula until small curds form. Remove from the heat and fold in the pulled chicken, cilantro and 1/2-inch tortilla strips. Fill the roasted poblanos with the mixture.To serve, spoon some of the cooked tomato salsa onto 8 large dinner plates, top each with a chile relleno and drizzle with some of the cheese sauce. Garnish with the julienned tortillas and cilantro leaves.'

S'For the Roast: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Season the pork with salt and pepper and sear well on all sides.  Drain off the fat, and add the remaining ingredients to the pot.  Place in the oven and cook until the internal temperature of the meat registers 150 degrees F, about 2 hours.  Remove the meat to a plate and remove the vegetables and herbs with a slotted spoon. Add more water if needed.  Bring the cooking liquid to a boil and reduce by half. Whisk in the butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. For the Spicy Orange Vinaigrette: Place orange juice in a small nonreactive pan over high heat and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup.

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Spread the bread onto a large baking sheet (or 2 smaller baking sheets) in an even layer and bake, stirring a few times, until lightly golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove and let cool. Once cooled, put the cubes into a very large bowl.Increase the heat to 375 degrees F. Combine the mushrooms in a large baking dish or baking sheet, toss with 3 tablespoons of the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven, stirring several times, until soft and golden brown, about 25 minutes.While the mushrooms are roasting, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of the canola oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat in the saute pan and place back on the stove over high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add 3 cups of the chicken stock and the herbs, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer.Add the mushrooms to the bread, and then add the onion/stock mixture, egg, salt and pepper, and gently stir until combined. The dressing should be very wet, add more stock as needed. Scrape the mixture into a buttered 13 by 9 by 2-inch glass baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil, and continue baking until the top is golden brown, about 30 to 40 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.'

Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Cook the ancho, coriander, cumin and chile de arbol for 1 minute. Add the saffron and its soaking water. Remove from the heat.Whisk together the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice and garlic-saffron mixture in a medium bowl. Mix in the bell peppers, tomatoes, mint leaves and cilantro. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld, or refrigerate overnight. Bring to room temperature before serving.For the grilled white fish: Heat a charcoal grill for direct grilling at medium-high heat. Brush both sides of the halibut with the canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the halibut until golden brown and charred on both sides and cooked to medium or well done, about 10 minutes each side.Carefully transfer the halibut to a platter and top with the chermoula immediately. Let the halibut rest for 5 minutes before serving, to allow flavors to sink in.'

S'Put the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water by 2 inches. Add 2 tablespoons salt and bring to a boil. Cook until a skewer inserted into the center of each potato meets with no resistance, about 20 minutes. Drain well and let them cool slightly while you prepare the mushrooms.Heat 2 tablespoons each of the butter and canola oil in a large cast-iron pan over high heat until the mixture begins to shimmer. Add the mushrooms, garlic and shallots. Cook until the mushrooms are golden brown and all of the liquid has evaporated, and the shallots are tender. Transfer to a bowl.Cut the potatoes into 1/2-inch dice, keeping the skin on. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and oil in the same pan over medium-high heat, and heat until the mixture begins to shimmer. Add the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Spread in one layer and cook, pressing with a spatula, until crisp and deep golden brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, parsley, thyme and vinegar. Toss to warm through, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a platter and drizzle with olive oil. Serve hot or at room temperature.'

Combine the honey, canola oil, olive oil, sugar, syrup, vanilla, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until smooth. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix well until combined. Turn the mixture out onto an 11- by 7-inch jelly-roll pan, and spread into an even layer.Bake, stirring and re-spreading the mixture into an even layer every 5 minutes, until the granola is light golden brown, about 45 minutes. Immediately turn the granola out onto another jelly-roll pan to cool and stop the cooking process. Stir in the apricots and raisins and then spread the granola evenly in the pan. Set on a wire rack and cool to room temperature. Loosen any dried granola with a spatula and store in an airtight container.For the parfait: Combine the nectar, apricots, sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the apricots are soft, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and cover. Let the mixture chill in the fridge.Fold the apricot puree into the yogurt (don\\'t combine completely), and layer in parfait glasses with the California granola."

S'Special equipment: a pasta machine and fettuccine cutterFor the pasta dough: Combine the flour, eggs and yolk in a food processor and pulse until a dough comes together. Transfer to a counter dusted lightly with flour and knead gently until the dough comes together and is smooth, about 1 minute. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.Divide the dough into 4 pieces. With your hands, flatten and shape one piece of dough into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Dust it lightly with flour and pass it through the widest setting on the pasta machine. If the dough comes out oddly shaped, reform into a rectangle. Fold it in thirds, like a letter, and if necessary, flatten it to a 1/2-inch thickness. Pass it through the widest setting again with the seam of the letter perpendicular to the rollers. Repeat this folding and rolling step 10 to 12 times, dusting the dough with flour if it becomes sticky.Without folding the dough, pass it through the next setting on the pasta machine. Keep reducing the space between the rollers after each pass, lightly dusting the pasta with flour on both sides each time, until the pasta is about 1/16-inch thick and 3 inches wide.Lay the rolled-out dough on a counter. Roll out the remaining dough in the same manner. Cut each strip of dough into 11-inch lengths. Cut the dough into fettuccine. (Alternatively, use store-bought dried or fresh fettuccine.)For the meat: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook slowly until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp, 8 to 10  minutes. Transfer the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.Increase the heat to high, add the chuck and pork to the pan and season with the fennel, chile flakes, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain the excess fat from the pan.For the quick bolognese sauce: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the celery, fennel, onion and carrot and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and ground fennel and cook for 1 minute more.Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and chicken stock and cook until the tomatoes begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Coarsely mash the tomatoes using a potato masher or wooden spoon, season with salt and pepper and cook until the sauce comes to a boil and begins to thicken slightly, about 15 minutes. Add the cooked bacon, chuck and pork to the pan and continue cooking until the sauce is thick, about 15 minutes more. Fold in the parsley and oregano and season with salt and pepper.For the garlic bread: Preheat the broiler.Place the ciabatta on a baking sheet cut-side up. Heat it under the broiler until lightly golden brown. Combine the butter, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Slather the garlic butter over the bread and broil until bubbly and golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove, let cool for a few minutes and cut into slices.To serve: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, about 4 minutes (if using dried noodles, follow package directions). Reserve a cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta. Put about 2 cups of the sauce in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the pasta, creme fraiche, some of the pasta water and a few handfuls of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Toss, top with the parsley and serve. Reserve remaining sauce for another use.'

S'For the lobster relish: Bring an inch of water to a boil in a large pot with a steamer insert. Set the lobster belly-up on a cutting board. Pierce it with a knife just under the base of the head, and cut it deeply through the belly to kill it quickly. Transfer the lobster to the steamer, cover and cook for 8 minutes.Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil along with the garlic to a small saute pan set over medium heat. Cook until golden and fragrant, then transfer the garlic to a medium bowl. Add the tomatoes, red pepper flakes and lemon zest and juice to the bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.The moment the lobster is done shock it in an ice bath to stop cooking. When cool enough to handle, pull off the tail and claws and remove the meat. Chop up the meat and add it to the tomato mixture. Drizzle with some olive oil.In another saute pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the lobster-tomato mixture and heat it through. Add the white wine and cook for another minute. Remove from heat and stir in the parsley and oregano.For the steak: About 20 minutes before cooking, remove the steak from the refrigerator and let it sit, covered, to come up to room temperature. Mix together the ancho powder, paprika, mustard, salt, cayenne, coriander, cumin and black pepper in a bowl and set aside.Preheat a large cast-iron pan over high heat and set the oven to broil.Brush the steak on both sides with the canola oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Sprinkle one side of the steak with the spice rub. Drizzle a little canola oil in the pan; when it begins to smoke, add the steak rub-side down and cook until a nice crust forms, about 2 minutes.Transfer the steak to a cutting board and slice it against the grain 1-inch thick. Return the steak to the pan, rub-side up. Scatter the butter on top and broil to medium-rare, about 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and baste the steak with the pan juices.Assembly: Arrange the steak and the lobster relish on a plate. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the steak juices. Garnish with oregano and parsley.'

S'Whisk together 1 quart of the buttermilk, 2 tablespoons salt, and the chili de arbol in a large bowl or large baking dish. Add the chicken, turn to coat, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Place the remaining 2 cups of buttermilk in a bowl. Stir together the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika and cayenne in a large bowl and divide among 2 shallow platters and season generously with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off. Dredge in the second plate of flour and pat off the excess. Put the chicken pieces on a baking rack set over a baking sheet while the oil heats. Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast iron skillet; the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces. Serve hot, drizzled with the ancho honey.'

S"For the shrimp: Prepare a charcoal grill for high direct heat. Skewer a few shrimp onto 2 skewers so the shrimp lay flat. Do the same with the tomatoes. Brush the skewers with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the tomatoes first, until slightly charred on both sides and soft, about 2 minutes each side. Reserve the shrimp skewers to the side.Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Cook the garlic and shallots until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the grilled tomatoes, wine, paprika, cinnamon, red pepper flakes and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Crush the tomatoes with a spoon. Cook until the sauce thickens. Taste; add some honey if the tomatoes aren\\'t sweet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir in the mint, oregano and lemon zest.Grill the shrimp until just cooked through and slightly charred, about 1 1/2 minutes each side. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and add to the tomato mixture. Toss the shrimp just to coat and transfer to a platter. Top the shrimp with the feta and mint sprigs and drizzle with olive oil. Serve with the pitas to dip in tomato juices."

S"Make the crust: Combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times. Scatter the butter and shortening over the flour mixture and pulse until it resembles coarse meal. Gradually add 4 to 7 tablespoons ice water, pulsing until the dough just comes together. Remove the dough from the machine and lightly knead on a flat surface to form a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.Position a rack in the bottom of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Make the filling: Combine the peaches, brown and granulated sugars, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, peach eau de vie and cornstarch or tapioca in a large bowl and mix until well combined. Toss the blackberries with the cassis in a separate bowl. Let sit 10 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to spoon the berries into the peach mixture and toss.Divide the chilled dough in half and roll out each half into a 13-to-14-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Transfer one of the rounds to a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Spoon the fruit into the crust using a slotted spoon; add some of the juices that have accumulated in the bowl (about  1/4 cup). Scatter the butter over the top. Roll up the remaining dough round on the rolling pin, then unroll it on top of the filling. Trim the edges of both crusts to a 3/4-inch overhang. Fold the edges over; press to seal and crimp the edges. Cut 6 slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush the top of the pie with the cream and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar.Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake on the bottom oven rack until the crust is golden and the juices bubble thickly through the slits, 1 hour, 20 minutes to 1 hour, 30 minutes. (Cover the crust\\'s edge with foil if it browns too quickly.) Let the pie cool about 3 hours before serving.Photograph by Steve Giralt"

S'For the butter: Combine the butter and thyme in a food processor and process until smooth, then season with salt and pepper. Scrape the butter into a ramekin, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold and the flavors meld, at least 2 hours and up to 48 hours.For the prime rib: Remove the prime rib from the refrigerator 2 hours before roasting. Pat the surface dry with paper towels. Make 8 small slits over the surface of the fat cap and fill each slit with a whole garlic clove.Place the roast on a large cutting board, then brush with oil and season heavily with salt and pepper 15 minutes before roasting.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Place the roast, bone-side down (fat-side up), in a large roasting pan fitted with a rack. Roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue roasting until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted into the center and ends of the meat registers 125 degrees F for medium-rare doneness, about 3 hours. Start checking the temperature after 2 hours.Transfer the meat to a cutting board with a juice groove. Pour off all but a few tablespoons of the fat from the pan, and place the roasting pan over two burners set to high heat. Add the shallots and the remaining 3 cloves chopped garlic, and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the wine and vinegar and cook until reduced by three-quarters, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and peppercorns, and bring to a boil. Cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Strain the sauce into a medium saucepan set over low heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced a bit further. Slowly whisk in the cold thyme butter and cook until the sauce thickens (do not boil or the sauce will break). Season with salt and pepper. Finish with a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar and the chopped parsley to serve.'

S'To cure the pheasant: In a large bowl combine the water, 1/4 cup each of sugar and salt, mixing to dissolve. Add the pheasant breasts, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.To make sauces: In a large, non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium to medium-high heat. Add the shallots cooking until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla bean and seeds, white wine, cider, and cream. Bring to a simmer cooking until the liquids are reduced and thickened to sauce consistency, about 10 minutes. Add the ginger. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.In another saucepan, combine the red wine and the honey. Bring to a simmer over high heat cooking until reduced to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Reserve.To cook the pheasants: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.In a large non-stick ovenproof skillet, add 2 tablespoons butter and melt over high heat. Season the pheasant with salt, pepper, and coriander. Add the pheasant skin side down, cooking until browned and well-seared, about 5 minutes. Turn over and transfer the pan to the lower rack of the oven. Cook until just about medium, about 6 to 8 minutes depending on the size of the pheasant breast. Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven. Allow to rest a couple of minutes before cutting.In another large, non-stick, skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the butter over high heat. Add the Anjou pears cooking until they just begin to soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Add two tablespoons of the sugar cooking while occasionally stirring until browned on the edges, about 4 minutes. Remove the pears and keep warm.To Serve: Position the rice pilaf mixture in a cylinder form in the center of each hot serving plate. Position the pear slices around the rice cylinder. Slice the pheasant on a bias to yield 4 or 6 thin broad slices. Stack the slices on top of the rice cylinder. Spoon the vanilla-ginger and red wine sauce artistically over and around the pheasant and on the plate. Sprinkle the dish with freshly ground black pepper and chives. Garnish with the vanilla bean and sprigs of chive over the pheasant. Serve immediately.'

S"For the vinaigrette: Combine the wine, fennel seeds, peppercorns and thyme in a wide shallow saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup. Strain the mixture into a blender and discard the solids.Add the vinegar and salt to taste and blend to combine. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until emulsified; add the honey to taste.For the dough: Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups flour and the salt, stirring until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups flour. Continue adding the flour (up to 1/2 cup), 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until the dough comes away from the bowl but is still sticky.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead with lightly floured hands. Start by slapping the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself (use a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape the dough from the surface). Repeat until it\\'s easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading normally until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in volume, 3 hours. Press it with your finger to see if it\\'s done; an indent should remain.Prepare the charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash). Add to the grill and create a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, leaving the other half with no coals.Remove the dough from the bowl, divide in half and shape each half into a ball. Brush with oil and set aside for 30 minutes.Stretch and shape each ball of dough into a 12 by 10-inch rectangle or round on a flat surface. Brush the tops of each with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let rest for 15 minutes. Place on the grill directly over the coals, oiled side down, and grill until lightly golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip over and grill for 1 minute longer.Place the flatbreads on a flat surface and divide the Monterey Jack cheese evenly over the top. Arrange the cut figs on top and the blue cheese around the figs. Return to the grill on the opposite side of the coals, for indirect heat, close the cover and cook until the cheese has melted and the figs are heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the grill and drizzle with some of the red wine vinaigrette and garnish with parsley leaves. Cut and serve immediately."

Do not allow the mixture to boil after you add the pumpkin or the syrup will become cloudy (even after straining.)  Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool for 10 minutes.Place a mesh strainer over a medium bowl and line the strainer with several layers of cheesecloth.  Pour the mixture through the strainer and let it strain slowly into the bowl.  Add the vanilla extract to the syrup and transfer to a container with a tight fitting lid.  The syrup will last 1 month stored in the refrigerator. Makes about 1 1/2 cups; leftovers can be refrigerated for 1 week.'

Put the butter, cool orange syrup, zest, jalapeno and sage in a food processor and process until smooth, season with salt and pepper.  Scrape into a bowl.  Can be made 1 day in advance and stored, covered in the refrigerator.  Bring to room temperature before using. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Remove neck and gizzard from the turkey and discard.  Rinse the bird thoroughly with cold water and pat dry. Rub the entire surface with 1/2 of the butter.  Season the skin and the cavity liberally with salt and pepper.  Truss the turkey and place on rack in a large roasting pan. Roast the turkey for 30 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 375 degrees and continue roasting for 1 1/2 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, brushing with the remaining butter every 15 minutes.  Remove the turkey from the oven and let rest for 20 minutes before carving.'

S'Preheat the grill to high. Form the meat into 4 (1/4-inch thick) burgers. Season the meat with salt and pepper on both sides. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes on both sides for medium doneness. When the burgers are done, remove from the heat and reduce heat to medium-low.Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise and roasted garlic in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Spread both sides of each bun with mayonnaise and mustard. Place a slice of cheese on the bottom portion of each bun, place the burger on top of the cheese, then top the cheese with a slice of ham and another slice of cheese, and finally, the pickle slices. Place the tops of the bun over the pickles, wrap the burgers in aluminum foil, and place them on the grill. Using a heavy pan or a brick wrapped in foil, press down on the burgers for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Lower the lid on the grill and continue grilling for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the bun has become pressed and firm.'

S'For the tortilla chips: Heat oil in a deep fryer to 340 to 350 degrees F. Fry the tortillas, in batches, until firm. Drain on paper towels and season immediately with salt.For the new mexican rubbed pork tenderloin: Combine the ancho chili powder, sugar, pasilla chili powder, salt, allspice, chile de arbol, cinnamon and some black pepper in a small bowl.Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat. Sprinkle the pork with salt on both sides, and then dredge in the spice rub, tapping off any excess. Sear the pork on all sides until golden brown, and then continue cooking to medium doneness or when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135 to 140 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before thinly slicing.For the mornay sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook 1 minute. Slowly whisk in 2 cups of the warm milk, bring to a boil and continue whisking until the sauce thickens and the flour taste has been cooked out, about 5 minutes.Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the Monterey Jack a handful at a time. Continue whisking until smooth, adding more milk if too thick. Whisk in the Parmigiano-Reggiano and season with salt, black pepper and chile de arbol. Set aside.For the avocado-corn relish: Combine the avocado, corn, jalapeno, lime juice, onions and olive oil in a bowl. Season with salt and black pepper, and fold in the cilantro.For the charred jalapenos: Toss the jalapenos with the oil and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Char in a cast-iron pan over high heat or on a baking sheet in a 400 degrees F oven until the skin is charred on both sides. Let cool before slicing.For assembly: Arrange the tortilla chips on a large platter in a single layer. Top each chip with a heaping teaspoon of the avocado-corn relish, a slice of pork and some of the Mornay sauce. Garnish with the sliced charred jalapenos, pickled red onions, a dollop of the goat cheese and cilantro leaves.'

Turn the nectarines over and grill until just cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Remove from the grill and coarsely chop. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan on the grates of the grill. Add the onion and cook until soft. Add the chile, garlic, ginger and mustard seeds and cook for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and sugar and cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens slightly. Stir in the nectarines and cook for 1 minute, season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl, cool, and stir in the raisins, coconut and mint. Let cool to room temperature before serving.For the skewers:Heat the grill to high. Combine the coriander, cumin, mustard seeds and black peppercorns in a small skillet on the grates of the grill and grill until lightly toasted, about 1 1/2 minutes, stirring a few times; transfer to a coffee grinder and process until finely ground and place in a bowl. Add the ancho, turmeric, garlic, ginger, 1/4 cup canola oil and vinegar and whisk until it forms a paste. If the mixture is too dry, add a few tablespoons of water to loosen it to a paste. Place lamb in a large bowl, add the curry paste and toss to coat each piece of lamb. You can grill immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.Skewer 2 pieces of lamb onto 2 skewers so that the meat lays flat on the grill. Season both sides of the lamb with salt and grill until golden brown and slightly charred on both sides and cooked to medium-rare doneness, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with pita bread and chutney.'

S"Special equipment: waffle ironFor the waffles: Whisk together the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl.Whisk together the buttermilk, eggs and oil in a separate large bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until the mixture just comes together. Add the wild rice and fold until just combined. Let the mixture rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the waffle iron. Brush the waffle grates with some of the melted butter and make the waffles according to the manufacturer\\'s directions.For the chicken: Whisk together 4 cups buttermilk, 2 tablespoons salt and the chile de arbol in a large bowl or large baking dish. Add the chicken, turn to coat, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.Stir together the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika and cayenne in a large bowl and divide between 2 shallow platters. Season generously with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the remaining 2 cups buttermilk and allow the excess to drain off. Dredge in the second plate of flour and pat off the excess. Put the chicken pieces on a baking rack set over a baking sheet while the oil heats.Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast-iron skillet; the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces.Meanwhile, make the pink peppercorn sauce: In a small bowl, combine the honey, zest of the whole lime and the juice of only 1/2 of the lime. In a mortar, crush the peppercorns with the pestle until all the peppercorns are crushed lightly. Add to the honey and mix well.To serve: Place a waffle on a plate, top with 2 pieces of fried chicken and pour the pink peppercorn sauce over top."

S"Bring the milk, coconut milk and goat\\'s milk to a simmer over low heat in a small saucepan. Keep warm while you prepare the caramel.Combine the sugar and water in a medium saucepan over high heat and cook (do not stir) until it becomes a deep amber brown color. Slowly whisk in the warm milk mixture and continue whisking until smooth; add the vanilla seeds and corn syrup. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the sauce is reduced by half and is the consistency of a caramel sauce, about 55 minutes.Once the sauce is reduced, remove from the heat and whisk in the cold butter, vanilla extract, salt and rum and whisk until combined. Transfer the sauce to a medium bowl and stir in the pecans and coconut. Let the frosting cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally before frosting the cake.For the ganache:Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat. Put the chocolate into a medium bowl, add the hot cream and the corn syrup and let sit for 30 seconds. Gently whisk until smooth. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before pouring over the cake.For the chocolate cake:Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter 2 (9-inch) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl.Melt the 12 tablespoons of butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the cocoa powder and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the sugars and whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Add the coffee, buttermilk, eggs and vanilla extract and continue whisking until smooth and just combined. Slowly add the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture until combined.Divide the batter evenly between the 2 pans and bake on the middle rack until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 42 minutes. Let cool in the pans on a baking rack for 20 minutes. Then invert the cakes onto the baking rack and let cool for at least 1 hour before frosting. Slice each cake in half horizontally. Put 1 cake layer on a cake round or platter and spread 1/3 of the frosting evenly over the top, repeat to make 3 layers and top with the remaining cake layer, top side up. Pour the chocolate ganache over the cake and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before slicing.For the coconut whipped cream:Combine the heavy cream, coconut milk, sugar, rum and vanilla in a stand mixer and mix until soft peaks form. Slice the cake, top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and garnish with some of the toasted coconut."

Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss again. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours.For the ketchup: Whisk together the ketchup and chipotles in a small bowl.For the mustard: In another small bowl, whisk together the mustard and horseradish.For the burgers: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to high. Form the ground beef into four 3/4-inch-thick patties by tossing the meat from hand to hand and flattening gently. Make a well in the center of each patty with your thumb. Brush the patties with oil and season generously with salt and pepper.Grill the burgers until slightly charred and crusty, about 3 minutes (5 minutes for turkey, which must be cooked through to serve). Flip and continue grilling until slightly charred and crusty on the other side, 4 to 5 minutes longer for medium doneness (another 5 minutes for turkey). During the last minute of cooking, top each burger with two slices of cheese; cover the grill and cook until the cheese has melted.Transfer the burgers to a platter. If desired, toast the buns on the grill, flat-side down, for about 15 seconds, or until golden. Place the burgers on the bun bottoms. Top with some chipotle ketchup, horseradish mustard, Russian slaw dressing and a few potato chips, if using. Set the bun tops on top and serve immediately.'

Taste and season as necessary.Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and when it is almost smoking, add the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing once or twice, just until the tomatoes have a few dark spots, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, cool and halve.Add the tomatoes, scallions and basil to the grains. Pour the vinaigrette around the sides of the bowl; toss and fold the salad together.

S'For the gastrique sauce: Combine the orange juice, sugar, garlic, orange liqueur, ginger and 2 cups of the vinegar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the mixture reduces by half, about 20 minutes. Remove 1 cup of the reduction and set aside for the candied kumquats.Strain the remainder of the reduction left in the saucepan and transfer to a large high-sided saute pan. Cook over high heat until reduced by half again, about 15 minutes. Make small slits in the habanero with a paring knife, add it to the reduction and let cook for 5 minutes more. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the butter and cook until it melts. Add the parsley, chives, peppercorns and thyme and season with salt and pepper.For the duck confit: Whisk together the cinnamon, chile powders, cumin, coriander, ginger, sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, allspice, cloves, fennel seed, cayenne, chile de arbol and 2 tablespoons of the black pepper in a small bowl and set aside.Heat the oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat, add the bacon and cook until lightly golden brown on both sides and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and place a baking rack on a rimmed baking sheet.Season the duck legs with salt, pepper and some of the spice rub. Store any remaining spice rub in an airtight container for a later use. Place the legs fat-side down in the baking drippings in the nonstick pan. Cook slowly over medium heat until the skin is very crisp, about 10 minutes. Turn them over and cook until the other side is crisp, 10 minutes more. Transfer the prepared baking sheet and keep warm in theoven until ready to serve.For the duck breasts: Season the duck breasts on both sides with salt and pepper and place skin-side down in a cast iron pan. Cook slowly over medium heat, draining the rendered fat from the pan a few times, until the skin is very crisp, about 25 minutes. Turn the breasts over and continue cooking to medium and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 140 degrees F. Remove to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.For the candied kumquats: Bring the reserved 1 cup gastrique to a boil in a small saucepan, reduce the heat to low, add the kumquarts and cook until soft and candied, about 20 minutes.For the cranberry relish: Combine the orange juice and honey in a small saute pan, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by a quarter, about 3 minutes. Add the cranberries and cook until they pop and the mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes more. Set aside until ready to serve.To serve: Spoon some of the gastrique onto 4 large dinner plates. Top with the duck confit and the sliced duck and spoon some of the cranberries and kumquarts on the sides. Garnish with thyme sprigs, if desired.'

S'In a large bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups flour, sugar, salt, and yeast; add 1/2 cup margarine or butter (1 stick). With mixer at low speed, gradually pour 2 cups hot tap water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F.) into dry ingredients. Add egg; increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes, scraping bowl with rubber spatula. Beat in 3/4 cup flour or enough to make a thick batter; continue beating 2 minutes, occasionally scraping bowl. With spoon, stir in enough additional flour (about 2 1/2 cups) to make a soft dough.Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, working in more flour (about 1/2 cup) while kneading. Shape dough into a ball and place in greased large bowl, turning over so that top of dough is greased. Cover with towel; let rise in warm place (80 to 85 degrees F.) until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough is doubled when 2 fingers pressed into dough leave a dent.)Punch down dough by pushing down the center or dough with fist, then pushing edges of dough into center. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead lightly to make smooth ball, cover with bowl for 15 minutes, and let dough rest.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.In 17 1/4-inch by 11 1/2-inch roasting pan, over low heat, melt remaining 1/2 cup margarine or butter; tilt pan to grease bottom.On lightly floured surface with floured rolling pin, roll dough 1/2 inch thick. With floured 2 3/4-inch round cutter, cut dough into circles. Holding dough circle by the edge, dip both sides into melted margarine or butter pan; fold in half. Arrange folded dough in rows in pans, each nearly touching the other. Cover pan with towel; let dough rise in warm place until doubled, about 40 minutes.Bake rolls for 15 to 18 minutes until browned.'

S'For the flatbread: In an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the yeast, sugar, and water. Mix for 1 minute on low speed and let sit until the mixture just begins to bubble. Attach the dough hook and add the flours and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until it forms a mass, the dough should be sticky. Continue to add additional flour, if necessary, until the surface is dry enough to handle and dry enough to roll.Divide the dough into pieces, roll into balls and lightly brush with oil. Place on a floured surface and cover the balls with plastic wrap and a clean cloth and let proof for 2 hours at room temperature or place on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover and let proof overnight in the refrigerator.To form flatbread, pat each piece of dough out into a 5-inch disk and sprinkle liberally with flour. Roll each disk on a floured surface into a 10-inch diameter circle.Puncture the dough liberally with a fork to keep it from rising. Grill or bake each on a pizza stone or a lightly greased sheet pan for about 5 minutes at 425 degrees F. until dough starts to get crisp on the edges but still remains chewy.Spicy Hummus: Place chickpeas, garlic, chipotle puree, lemon juice, and tahini in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. With the machine running, slowly add the olive oil until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.To assemble and bake:Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.Top each pre-baked flatbread with the spicy hummus. Arrange any or all of the veggies on top of the hummus. Season with salt, pepper, and ancho powder.Place the bread back in the oven and bake for 5 minutes to heat through. Remove and add olives, goat cheese, and fresh basil. Cut into small squares and place on a platter.'

S'For the canadian bacon: Whisk the maple syrup and mustard in a small bowl. Set aside.  Heat the canola oil in a large cast-iron pan over high heat. Add the Canadian bacon and cook until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip and brush generously with the maple syrup mixture. Cook for another 2 minutes, and then transfer to a platter.For the cheddar and herb scramble: Heat the canola oil over high heat in another cast-iron skillet. Add the cherry tomatoes cut-side down and cook until seared, 1 to 2 minutes. Season them with salt and pepper, and transfer to a plate.Whisk together the eggs, Cheddar, chives, parsley and tarragon in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a large nonstick pan over medium-low heat until it begins to sizzle. Add the egg mixture and slowly cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until soft curds form. Remove from the heat and set aside.For the popovers: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Generously brush a 6-slot aluminum popover pan with softened butter. Place the pan in the oven to heat 5 minutes before you are ready to add the batter.Whisk together the melted butter, flour, milk, salt, pepper and eggs until smooth. The batter should be thin. Fill the popover pans less than halfway full and bake for exactly 30 minutes. Do not open the oven door while popovers are baking. Make the popovers last because they need to be eaten almost immediately once removed from the oven.For assembly: Open the popovers and fill each half with a slice of the bacon. Top each with the eggs, and a cherry tomato half. Serve the remaining tomatoes on the side.'

S'Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.For the bread pudding custard: Combine the cream, milk, vanilla bean and seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.Whisk together the yolks, granulated sugar and maple syrup in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the hot cream mixture until combined. Remove the vanilla pod and whisk in the apple brandy. Strain the custard into a clean bowl.For the apple-ginger caramel sauce: To a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the butter. Once melted, add the brown sugar and allow to melt. Next, add the apples, cinnamon sticks and ginger and saute until softened but still hold their shape. Season with salt. Deglaze with the apple brandy and allow to cook until the sauce has become a thick, glazy consistency. Remove the cinnamon sticks. Combine the apple-ginger caramel sauce with the bread.For the anglaise: Bring the half-and-half, nutmeg, cinnamon sticks and vanilla bean seeds to a simmer in a medium saucepan.Whisk together the yolks and granulated sugar in a medium bowl until at the pale ribbon stage. Slowly whisk in the hot half-and-half, return the mixture to the pan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture coats the back of the spoon. Strain into a bowl and set over an ice bath. Stir until chilled. Cover with plastic wrap directly on surface and refrigerate at least 1 hour before servingTo assemble and bake: Place the silicone molds in a roasting pan. Fill the molds with the soaked bread, and then pour the bread pudding custard over the bread, pressing down on the bread to totally submerge it in the custard. Let sit for 15 minutes to allow the bread to soak up some of the custard.Place the pan in a larger roasting pan and pour in hot tap water until it comes halfway up the sides of the inner roasting pan. Bake until the sides are slightly puffed and the center jiggles slightly, about 45 minutes.Remove from the oven and the water bath and cool on a baking rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.For the whipped cream: In a cold bowl, whisk the cream and vanilla extract until soft peaks form. Fold in the creme fraiche until combined.Unmold the bread pudding, serve with the vanilla bean creme anglaise and whipped cream. Dust with cinnamon, powdered sugar and garnish with mint. Bread pudding is best served warm.'

Put the milk in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the oatmeal, orange zest, and salt and cook until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes. Cover and let sit for 2 minutes. The oatmeal should be slightly loose, it will continue to thicken under the broiler.Divide half of the apple mixture between 2 10-ounce ramekins. Divide half of the oatmeal between the 2 ramekins and spoon on top of the apple mixture. Place the remaining apple mixture on top of the oatmeal then top the apple mixture with the remaining oatmeal.

Whisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, jalapeno, honey and remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil in a large bowl and let sit while you prepare the noodles. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the soba noodles and cook until just tender, approximately 5 minutes.

S'For the creme anglaise: Combine the milk, chicory, cloves and cinnamon in a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, refrigerate and leave to infuse for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.Make an ice bath by setting a medium bowl or large measuring cup into a large bowl of ice.Strain the milk mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a clean, small saucepan; discard the solids. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until very pale and thick. Very gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the eggs. When full incorporated, transfer back to the saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and add the brandy and orange zest. Switch to a wooden spoon and cook, stirring, until the mixture coats the back of the spoon, about 5 minutes.Strain into the bowl set in the ice bath. Add water to the ice to cool the sauce down faster. Stir the sauce until cool. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour.For the beignets: Mash the bananas in a large bowl using a potato masher or large fork. Add the banana liqueur, vanilla extract, granulated sugar and muscovado sugar, and mix well. In another bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add the banana mixture to the flour mixture and pour in the milk. Mix until smooth and thick, like waffle batter, adding a little more milk as needed. Set aside to rest for at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.In a heavy pot set over medium heat, heat 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350 degrees F. Drop the batter by heaping teaspoonfuls into the oil and fry until golden brown on both sides, turning once when the edges are firm. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately, or keep warm in a 200-degree oven for up to 2 hours.Plate the beignets atop a pool of creme anglaise. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.'

S"Dissolve the yeast in warm water in a large bowl and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups flour and the salt, stirring until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups flour; continue adding flour 1 tablespoon at a time (up to 1/2 cup), stirring until the dough comes away from the bowl but is still sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead with lightly floured hands. Start by slapping the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself (use a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape the dough from the surface). Repeat until it\\'s easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading normally until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in volume, about 3 hours. Press it with your finger to see if it\\'s done; an indent should remain.Prepare the charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash) and add to the grill, creating a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, leaving the other half with no coals.Gently remove the dough from the bowl and divide in 4 pieces. Shape the pieces into rounds and let them rest on a sheet pan, covered with a clean side towel, for 30 minutes.Stretch and shape each piece of dough into a large rectangle or circle on a flat surface. Brush the tops of each with the some olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill directly over the coals, oiled-side down, and grill until lightly golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip over and grill for 1 minute longer. Remove from the grill and arrange the taleggio over the top. Then dollop on some ricotta and sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano. Return to the grill on the opposite side (for indirect grilling). Cover and grill until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Top each pizza with the arugula and drizzle with truffle oil."

Add the butter; when almost all melted, add the potatoes, salt, oregano, coriander, cumin and pepper. Toss the potatoes to coat with fat and spices, then let them cook, pressing occasionally with a spatula, until very dark and crispy on the bottom, about 5 minutes.Meanwhile, whisk together the mustard, vinegar, 1 teaspoon honey and some salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil to make a thick dressing. Taste and add honey or salt and pepper as needed.When the potatoes have developed a nice dark crust, use the spatula to turn them over in chunks, pressing them again into the bottom of the pan to toast slightly. Scatter the scallions and cilantro on top and toss a bit to combine. Drizzle with some of the dressing. Transfer the hash browns to a serving platter. Serve with the remaining dressing on the side.'

To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S'Butter a 4-quart baking dish. Place turkey breast in a medium saucepan, cover with stock, and add parsley, bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns. Bring stock to a boil, reduce heat to low. Cover pot and simmer until turkey is just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Transfer turkey to a plate, remove herbs and peppercorns with a slotted spoon. When turkey is cool enough to handle, cut into 1/2-inch thick pieces and transfer to the buttered baking dish.Add carrots and turnips to the broth and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer carrots, turnips and thawed peas to the buttered baking dish. Strain broth into a bowl. Melt butter in the same pot over medium heat. Add leeks and shallots and cook until soft. Add flour and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in broth and white wine. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook until reduced slightly. Add cream and cook until sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon. Season with salt and pepper and add the parsley and sage. Pour the sauce over the turkey and vegetables in the baking dish.For the Crust: Place flour, herbs, and salt in a food processor and process until herbs are finely chopped. Add butter and shortening and process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add a few tablespoons of the cold water at a time and pulse until the mixture just comes together. Gather dough into ball and chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll dough into a 15 by 10 1/2-inch rectangle and place dough over onto filling.
