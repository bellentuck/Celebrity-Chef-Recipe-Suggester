S'Adjust the oven racks to accommodate a large covered roasting pan. Fit the pan with a shallow rack. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Unwrap the ham and rinse it in cold water. Place it on the rack in the roasting pan. Cover the pan with the lid and bake for half the estimated cooking time (total cooking time is about 20 minutes per pound, so 6 hours to 6 hours 40 minutes total).Halfway through the estimated cooking time, add the sugar and honey to a saucepan, cooking over medium heat until smooth and the sugar is dissolved. Pour the mixture over the ham and continue baking the ham, basting occasionally with the drippings in the roaster. Check for doneness at the end of the estimated cooking time by inserting a meat thermometer at a meaty point (not into fat or touching the bone). It should register 160 degrees F.Yield: 15 to 20 servings'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the half-and-half and 6 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once up to a boil, stir in the grits. Bring it back up to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture has slightly thickened (it should resemble cooked oatmeal in thickness), 10 to 15 minutes. Use a whisk to break up any lumps that have formed.Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until just turning crispy, about 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and place it on a paper towel, patting it to remove any excess fat. Using the same saucepan, add the onions to the leftover bacon drippings and saute until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Then add the collard greens and the remaining 2 cups chicken stock and cook until tender, another 10 minutes. Drain the collards and onions in a colander.Once the grits are done, add the Parmesan, butter, salt, pepper and 1/2 cup of the Monterey jack. Stir until the butter has melted and all the ingredients are well combined. Then add the drained collards mixture and stir.Transfer the grits mixture to the prepared baking dish and top with the crumbled bacon and the remaining 1/2 cup Monterey jack. Bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15 minutes.'

S"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Prepare the chocolate by melting it in the top of a double boiler, stirring until it is smooth. Add 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) of the butter and stir until it is melted and blended. Add the warm milk and stir until smooth. Set the chocolate aside to cool.Line the bottoms only of three 9-inch cake pans with circles of parchment paper, or grease each pan bottom only with solid shortening and dust lightly with flour. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt.Whip the egg whites until stiff using the wire beater of the mixer. Transfer the beaten whites to a separate bowl and set aside.In the mixer bowl, cream the remaining 1 1/2 sticks of butter and the sugar together until fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the melted, cooled chocolate and the vanilla. Mix well.With the mixer on very low, stir in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Do this by adding about a third of the flour and slowly stirring it in completely. Then add about half the buttermilk and stir it in. Continue adding flour and buttermilk in this manner, ending with the flour. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and stir again. With a long-handled spoon or spatula, fold and stir the beaten egg whites into the batter until the batter is smooth with no visible clumps of whites.Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30 to 40 minutes. Bake on the middle rack of the oven, allowing at least 1/4-inch clearance between the pans and the oven walls. The cake will rise above the pan edges as it bakes but will not spill over and will settle back down as it continues to bake. The cake is done when it begins to pull away from the sides of the pans and springs back to a light touch. Cool the layers in the pans for about 8 minutes.Run a knife around the edges of each pan and turn the layers out onto wire racks that have been sprayed with cooking spray. Cool the layers completely before frosting.For the frosting: Place the butterscotch morsels in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water or in the top of a double boiler. Stir until melted, then remove from the heat.In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the cream cheese until smooth. Add the butter and confectioner\\'s sugar, and continue mixing. Add the melted butterscotch morsels and the heavy cream and vanilla, and mix until fully combined.To assemble the cake: Place one layer on a cake stand and spread with frosting. Frost each layer completely, top and sides, as it is added to the cake."

S'For the biscuit dough: Using a pastry blender or two table knives, cut the shortening into the flour in a medium bowl until it resembles coarse meal. Use a fork to stir in the buttermilk to make a soft dough, or until the dough comes together and leaves the sides of the bowl. Continue stirring with the fork until all the flour is worked into the dough, and then turn the dough onto a lightly floured board and knead three or four times until smooth and manageable.For the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.Combine the beef, onion, salt and pepper in a large skillet and cook over a medium heat until the meat is browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour and 1/3 cup of the reserved tomato liquid. Remove 1 cup of this meat mixture and set aside. Add the tomatoes and the peas to the remaining mixture in the skillet. Set aside.On a well-floured surface, roll the biscuit dough into a large rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Spread the reserved cup of meat mixture thinly over the dough, and then roll the dough like a jelly roll, beginning from one long edge. Place the roll on the prepared baking sheet. Using kitchen shears or a very sharp knife, cut 1-inch slices almost through to the bottom of the roll. To expose some of the filling, pull alternate slices to the left and right. Bake until browned, about 15 minutesReheat the beef and vegetable mixture. Slice the baked loaf and spoon some of the hot vegetable and meat mixture over each slice.'

S'In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together at high speed with an electric mixer until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the orange zest and juice, oil, almond extract and vanilla extract, beating until blended. Sift the flour and baking powder together and add to the egg mixture, beating well. Fold in the almonds by hand. Remove the dough to plastic wrap, wrap and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Divide the dough in half. Spray your hands lightly with nonstick cooking spray and shape each portion into a 5-by-8-inch log on the baking sheet. Bake until firm, about 25 minutes. Cool the logs on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 15 minutes.Using a serrated knife, cut each log diagonally into 1/2-inch slices. Return the biscotti to the baking sheets and bake for 15 minutes. Turn the cookies over and bake for 15 more minutes. Cool on wire racks.'

Stir in the sour cream, buttermilk and melted butter to make a thick batter.Heat the oil in the skillet over medium heat until hot and shimmering. Spoon in the batter, spreading it to the edges. The oil will come up around the edges of the batter. Spread it over the top of the batter.

Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast until the beets are fork tender, about 1 hour.Meanwhile, place shallots in a small bowl, drizzle with another 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss well. After the beets have roasted for 45 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully place the shallots directly on the second layer of aluminum foil. Return to the oven for another 15 minutes, until the shallots are caramelized and soft and the beets are fully cooked.Let the beets cool in the foil for at least 5 minutes. Transfer the shallots to a large bowl and set aside. When the beets are cool enough to handle, use a paper towel to rub off the skins. Cut the beets into wedges and add them to the bowl with the shallots.Trim the tops and bottoms off the oranges with a paring knife or a small serrated knife. Set the oranges on one of the cut ends and carefully cut away the skins, beginning at the top and following the curve of the fruit down to the bottom. Slice the oranges crosswise into thin slices. Set aside.In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, mustard, some salt and pepper, and the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Pour the dressing over the beets and shallots; toss to combine. Add the mixed greens and the orange slices; toss again. Sprinkle with sunflower seeds.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch cake pansFor the cake: Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt and set aside. With an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Add the flour mixture in stages with 1 1/3 cups water, beginning and ending with the flour.Divide the batter evenly between the pans and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Turn the layers out onto racks that have been sprayed with cooking spray.For the caramel icing: Mix 3 cups of the sugar and the milk in a heavy 3-quart saucepan. Bring slowly to a boil and keep it hot. Caramelize the remaining cup of sugar in an iron skillet. Do this by cooking over medium-high heat and stirring and scraping the pan with a flat-edged spatula as the sugar melts. Continue to cook until the syrup turns to medium or dark brown in color. This occurs at about 320 degrees F to 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Do not scorch the syrup. Stream the syrup into the boiling sugar and milk mixture and cook to the soft ball stage, about 238 degrees F. Add the butter, vanilla extract and baking soda.Pour the hot mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer and beat as it cools until the icing is creamy, 15 to 20 minutes. Watch the icing because it will go from runny to too thick very quickly. Spread on the cake layers while the icing is still warm. If it becomes too stiff, add a few drops of hot water.'

Add the apples, lemon zest, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. Cover and cook until the apples break down and the mixture becomes stiff, about 50 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool while you put together the bread.Arrange 4 of the bread slices in a square shape on a flat surface. Place the Charlotte mold upside down on the bread and trace the opening with a sharp edge. (Alternatively, use a 2-quart ovenproof casserole dish.) Cut the bread following the traced line and brush both sides with the softened butter. Fit the bread into the bottom of the mold. Cut 11 of the bread slices in half lengthwise. They should be about the same height as the mold. Spread the halved slices with the softened butter and place them against the inside of the mold, overlapping like a fan. Fill the mold with the apple mixture. Cut the remaining 7 slices of bread into triangles, brush with the softened butter and fan the pieces over the top, pressing to fit into the top of the mold.Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Allow the pan to cool 15 minutes. Run a knife around the inside of the mold to loosen it before unmolding. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.'

Cook for 1 minute, and then add the shrimp. Stir in the milk and cook until the mixture is very thick, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice and some salt and pepper.Allow the croquette mixture to cool completely before shaping into small meatball-sized balls. Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Mix the beaten eggs with 2 tablespoons water. Double coat the croquettes by rolling them first in the crumbs, then in the egg mixture, and then in the crumbs again. Place each coated croquette on a baking sheet. Cover the croquettes and set them aside.For the creamed green peas: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook until smooth and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the milk and continue cooking on medium heat, stirring often. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the mixture is smooth and thick, about 6 minutes. Stir in the peas, and keep warm while you fry the croquettes.Heat the oil to about 375 degrees F in a deep, heavy pot. Preheat the oven to 150 degrees F.Add the croquettes to the hot oil in batches, making sure not to crowd the pan. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain the croquettes on paper towels, sprinkle with salt, and keep warm in the oven as you fry the remaining croquettes. Make sure the oil returns to 375 degrees F before cooking the next batch, or they will be heavy and greasy.'

S'Adjust the oven racks so the covered roasting pan fit easily inside. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.Rub the butter on the outside and in the cavity of the turkey. Sprinkle the salt and pepper on the inside and the outside of the turkey. Put the celery, onion and carrot in the cavity. Place the turkey, breast-side up, in a large roasting pan. Pour the boiling water into the pan. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and put the pan in the oven.Start a timer when the oven temperature returns to 500 degrees F. Bake for exactly 1 hour and turn off the oven. Do not open the oven door! Leave the turkey in the oven until the oven completely cools; this may take 4 to 6 hours. Reserve the pan juices and refrigerate the turkey if it will not be served soon after roasting.'

Pour the marinade over the ribs and seal the bag. Marinate the ribs in the refrigerator for a few hours, turning the bag occasionally to thoroughly coat the meat.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Drain and discard the marinade. Cut four slits in the top of the baking bag, if you are using one. Otherwise, remove the ribs, transfer them to the baking pan, and cover the pan with foil or a lid. Bake for 2 hours.For the barbecue sauce: While the ribs are baking, blend the  ketchup, chili sauce, brown sugar, dry mustard and 1/3 cup water in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then remove from the heat.When the ribs are cooked and tender, remove them from the baking bag. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.Brush the ribs on both sides with the barbecue sauce and return them to the oven to bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes longer. Just before serving, throw the ribs under the broiler to give them a bit of a char.'

S"Using an electric mixer, cream the shortening and add the sugar gradually, blending well, and beat until fluffy. Beat in the salt, and then add 4 to 5 tablespoons water by the tablespoon, beating continuously and adding just enough to achieve a smooth, spreadable consistency.Add the vanilla extract and beat on high until very fluffy. This frosting can be colored with food coloring if desired and transferred to pastry bags fitted with decorator tips for decorating. Yield: 1 quart.Cook\\'s Note: Using solid white shortening instead of butter as well as clear vanilla extract results in a pure white frosting that you can tint any color you like. If you can\\'t find clear vanilla extract, you can use regular vanilla extract, but your icing won\\'t be white. The regular extract will add a cream color to the icing."

Add the milk, sour cream, half the melted butter and the vanilla, whisking to blend. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the egg mixture into it. Whisk the ingredients together just until blended. Fold the blueberries and lemon zest into the batter.Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with some of the remaining melted butter. For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the hot skillet. Cook 3 or 4 pancakes at a time, depending on the size of the skillet. If the batter seems too thick, thin it with 1 to 2 tablespoons milk. When bubbles begin to form and "pop" on the pancake\\\'s surface, after  about 1 minute, and the outer edge looks done, flip it over and cook briefly for about 30 seconds on the other side.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Add the asparagus to a large pot of boiling water, keeping the bundles together with rubber bands or string. Cook for a couple of minutes; the asparagus should be bright green and still crunchy. List the bundles out of the water and slice off the tough ends of the asparagus. Drop the trimmed ends back in the boiling water and lower to a simmer.Run the asparagus tops under cold water to stop the cooking.Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Whisk in the flour to make a roux. Cook for 1 minute, then whisk in the milk and 1 cup of the asparagus cooking liquid. Add the salt and continue cooking until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Add the grated Cheddar and cook, stirring, until melted, about 1 minute.Arrange the asparagus in the bottom of a 9-by-12-by-2-inch baking dish, alternating the stem ends so each serving includes both heads and stems. Thinly slice the hard-boiled eggs and arrange them over the asparagus. Pour the cheese sauce over the eggs and asparagus and sprinkle with the cracker crumbs. Bake until lightly browned and bubbles appear around the edges, about 20 minutes.'

S'For the hash browns: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.Grate the onion on the largest holes of a box grater into a large bowl. Grate the potatoes and put in a strainer lined with cheesecloth or a kitchen towel. Squeeze the liquid from the potatoes, then add the dry potatoes to the bowl with the onions. Season with salt and pepper. Add the herbs and mix until well combined.Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Drop 1/4 cup of the potato mixture into the skillet, pressing down lightly with a spatula. Repeat until there are 4 hash browns in the skillet. Cook until golden brown on the bottom, 5 to 7 minutes, reducing the heat to medium low if they start to brown too quickly. Flip and cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat the process with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and remaining potato mixture.For the cheesy eggs: In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs and season with salt and pepper.Melt the butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lower the heat and add the egg mixture. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, push the eggs toward the center of the skillet and let the liquid run out. Cook, continually moving, until just set, about 2 minutes. Drop 2 tablespoons of the garlic-herb cheese into the middle. Gently fold the cheese into the warm eggs.Divide the hash browns among 4 plates. Top each with some cheesy eggs and sliced avocado. Dollop each portion of eggs with 1 tablespoon of the remaining garlic-herb cheese. Serve immediately.'

S"Using a food processor, blend the peanuts, tahini, lemon juice, parsley, garlic, lemon zest and cayenne pepper until coarsely chopped. With the food processor running, pour the olive oil through the top opening in a slow steady stream, processing until the mixture is smooth. Slowly add water, a tablespoon at a time, until desired spreading consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with your choice of chips, crackers or vegetables (We love it with red pepper strips!)Cook\\'s Notes: To boil your own fresh green peanuts, place them in a 3-quart stockpot, cover with water and add 2/3 cup salt for each gallon of water used. Bring to boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 1 1/2 hours, or until the nuts are tender. Drain and cool.Tahini isn\\'t always easy to find. Make your own by blending 1/4 cup vegetable oil with 1 cup toasted sesame seeds. Store the extra in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks."

S'Prepare the roast: Put the quartered onions in the bottom of a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Mix the brown sugar, smoked paprika, 2 teaspoons salt and a pinch of black pepper and rub it all over the pork roast. Add the roast to the slow cooker on top of the onions.Make the sauce: Chop the onion and puree in a blender. You may need to add a drop of water to the blender to help the onions completely puree. Place the pureed onion in a 2-quart saucepan with 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low. Cook, stirring constantly, until the water has almost evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the vinegar, tomato juice, 1/2 tablespoon black pepper, the garlic powder, cayenne and hot sauce and mix well. Increase the heat to medium high, return to a boil, then stir in the sugar. Remove from the heat.Drizzle 1 cup sauce over the roast in the slow cooker. Continue to cook the remaining sauce over low heat for 30 to 40 minutes, allowing it to reduce by half. Then remove the sauce from the heat, allow it to cool completely and refrigerate for later use.Meanwhile, cook the roast in the slow cooker on low for 8 to 12 hours, checking after 8 hours for tenderness. Remove the meat and onions from the slow cooker. Discard the onions and finely shred the pork, using two forks. Reserve the juices from the slow cooker to add to the meat for desired juiciness. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve on buns with a little mustard and coleslaw.Photograph by Sarah Anne Ward'

S"Set the red pepper over a gas burner on high and rotate with tongs until blackened on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer the pepper to a bowl, cover with a dish towel, and set aside to steam for a couple of minutes. Rub the pepper with paper towels to remove the skindon\\'t worry if bits of skin remain; they\\'ll lend some charred flavor. Stem and seed the pepper, and then roughly chop. (If using a jarred pepper, simply stem, seed and chop.)In a food processor, combine the chickpeas, tahini, basil, garlic, lemon juice and chili powder. Process until combined. With the motor running, drizzle in oil and then slowly add water (about 1/4 cup) until the desired consistency is reached; bear in mind that the hummus will thicken in the refrigerator. Season with salt and pepper, and chill before serving to let the flavors meld.Garnish the hummus with a basil sprig, and drizzle with olive oil. Serve with pita chips and crudites."

S'Preheat the oven to 425degrees F. Line a jelly-roll pan or baking sheet with foil to place the pie on before cooking; it will keep any filling from dripping into the oven and burning.In a medium saucepan, combine the carrots, peas, potatoes and celery. Cover with water, bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, drain and set aside.In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the onions in the butter substitute until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, salt, pepper, celery seed and garlic powder. Cook for 2 minutes to get the flour taste out. Slowly stir in the broth and then add the milk. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the drained vegetables.Roll out one of the unbaked crusts to a 13-inch diameter and place in a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Pour the mixture into the bottom crust. Roll out the second pie crust and place on top. Seal the edges and cut small slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. If the top of the pie becomes too dark, loosely cover with foil and continue cooking. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.'

Fold the dough in half, press again to 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick, and then fold again. Cut the dough using a 2- to 3-inch round biscuit cutter, depending personal preference. Brush the bottom of a cast-iron skillet with some of the melted butter. Place the biscuits in the skillet; brush the tops with melted butter.Bake until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes, depending on size. Brush again with melted butter and serve immediately.'

S'For the jalapeno pimiento cheese: Drain 1 jar of the pimientos and place in a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth. Drain the second jar. Using an electric mixer, combine the Cheddar, cream cheese, pureed pimentos and diced pimientos, beating until smooth. Add the mayonnaise and jalapenos and mix until fully combined.For the fried green tomatoes: Cut the ends off of the tomatoes and slice into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper.In a shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of freshly ground pepper. In a second shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. In a third shallow bowl whisk together the panko, cornmeal and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.Working with one tomato slice at a time, first coat the tomato with the flour mixture, shaking off the excess. Then coat with the egg mixture, followed by the panko mixture. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes.Heat 2 cups oil in a large skillet over medium heat until a pinch of panko sizzles when dropped in. Carefully place some of the tomatoes into the heated oil in a single layer. Fry until golden, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat the frying process with the remaining tomatoes, changing the oil if the particles left in the oil between batches begin to burn.For the BPT: Cook the bacon in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until desired crispness, 8 to 10 minutes. Gently spread one side of each slice of bread with the jalapeno pimiento cheese. Arrange the bacon, then the fried green tomatoes and then the lettuce on 4 slices. Top with the remaining slices, and cut each sandwich in half. Serve immediately.'

S'For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 2 cupcake pans with cooking spray.With an electric mixer, beat the cake mix, gelatin, oil, strawberries and a 1/2 cup water until fully combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcakes comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool in the pan, and then remove before icing.For the icing: In a blender or food processor, puree the butter, sugar and strawberries for the glaze until smooth; it may take a few minutes to come together. Poke holes in the cupcakes with a toothpick, then spoon the icing over, allowing some of it to seep into the cake. Store the cupcakes, covered in the refrigerator, for up to 2 weeks.'

Place it on the rack in the roasting pan. Cover the pan with the lid and bake for half the estimated cooking time (Total cooking time is about 20 minutes per pound.) Halfway through the estimated cooking time, add the sugar and honey to a saucepan, cooking over medium heat until smooth and sugar is dissolved. Pour the mixture over the ham and continue baking the ham, basting occasionally with the drippings in the roaster.Check for doneness at the end of the estimated cooking time by inserting a meat thermometer at a meaty point (not into fat or touching the bone). It should register 160 degrees F.Allow the ham to stand for 15 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to set.'

Let stand until bubbles appear, 2 to 3 minutes.Using your hands, mix the 1 cup cold butter into the flour, breaking the butter into small pebbles, until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Make a well in the center and add the buttermilk and the yeast mixture. Gently fold the flour into the wet ingredients. Keep mixing until a ball starts to form, then gently knead, 12 to 15 times, to create a smooth dough. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for approximately 1 hour.Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and press out to 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick. Fold the dough in half, press again to 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick, and then fold again. Cut the dough using a 2- to 3-inch round biscuit cutter, depending personal preference. Brush the bottom of a cast-iron skillet with some of the melted butter. Place the biscuits in the skillet; brush the tops with melted butter.Bake until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes, depending on size. Brush again with melted butter and serve immediately.Yield: 8 to 12 biscuits'

S"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Line a 9-by 13- by 2-inch pan or your oven\\'s broiler pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil large enough to fully wrap the roast. The shiny side of the foil should be up. Sprinkle the roast on all sides with salt and pepper and place it in the center of the foil. Spread the onion slices over the top of the roast and pour the vinegar around it. Bring the ends of the foil together and fold several times, and then fold the ends together to completely enclose the roast. Pour about 1 inch of water into the pan around the foil-wrapped roast. Bake until the meat is fork tender and brown, 3 to 4 hours. Check the water level in the pan regularly during cooking and replenish it if necessary. If any juice seeps from the foil seals during roasting, save it to use in making the gravy.When the roast is done, remove the package from the baking pan and let it cool for a few minutes. Open the package carefully to preserve all the juices and transfer the meat to a platter. Cover with a tent of foil to keep it warm while you make the gravy.Pour the roasting juices into a measuring cup and let the fat rise to the surface. Skim off the fat, reserving 4 tablespoons in a saucepan and discarding the rest. (If the fat measures less than 4 tablespoons, add enough butter to make up the difference.)Measure the remaining defatted pan juices and reserve. If you have less than 2 cups, add water to make 2 cups. Add the flour to the fat in the saucepan and stir with a wire whisk to make a roux. Cook over medium-low heat until the flour is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the reserved pan juices and stir until thickened.Slice the roast or cut it into chunks (it will be very tender), and serve it with the gravy."

Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of an ungreased 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish. Combine the chocolate chips and the remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate and peanut butter are melted and smooth; two intervals should be enough. Mix to blend, then spread over the peanut butter-pretzel layer. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before cutting into squares."

Then cut each half lengthwise in half again, so you have 4 long pieces with leaves at one end.Add the jelly, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and salt to a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is fully combined and liquid.Brush the pineapple with some of the mixture (reserve the remaining mixture), transfer to the grill and grill 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a platter and, using a sharp knife, cut the bottom ends off each piece of pineapple. Then, carefully cut lengthwise from the bottom to the top of each piece along the skin (separating the fruit from the skin), and then crosswise into 1-inch pieces.Drizzle the remaining apricot mixture over the pineapple. Serve with vanilla ice cream.'

S'Adjust the oven racks to accommodate a large roasting pan. Fit the pan with a shallow roasting rack. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Unwrap the ham and rinse it under cold water. Place it on the rack in the roasting pan. Cover with foil and bake 1 hour 40 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the brown sugar and honey in a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the mixture is smooth and the sugar has dissolved.Pour the brown sugar glaze over the ham and continue roasting1 hour 40 minutes more, basting at least twice with the drippings in the roaster. (To adjust the total roasting time for a smaller or larger ham, calculate 20 minutes per pound.) Check for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into a meaty spot (not into fat or touching the bone)-it should register 160 degrees F.Let the ham stand 15 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to set. (You can make the ham up to 2 hours ahead; tent with foil and serve at room temperature.)Photograph by Anna Williams'

S"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray and lightly dust with flour. Set aside.In a small bowl, mash the bananas and then stir in the lemon juice. Set aside. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and granulated sugar until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the vanilla wafers in 3 additions and the buttermilk in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the wafers. Beat until combined, then add the mashed bananas and vanilla and beat until fully incorporated.Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before turning out onto racks to cool completely.For the filling: Separate the yolk from the white of 1 of the eggs. Discard the white. In a saucepan, whisk together the granulated sugar, flour, cornstarch and salt until completely combined. Stir in the egg yolk and remaining whole egg, and then stir in the milk. Cook uncovered over medium heat, stirring often, until the pudding thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cover the pudding with plastic wrap, laying the wrap directly on the surface so a skin doesn\\'t form. Chill in the fridge until completely cooled, about 30 minutes.Spread the pudding between the cake layers. Chill the cake until the pudding filling is set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Sprinkle the top of the cake with confectioners\\' sugar just before serving."

S'For the sauce: Puree the onion in a blender with 1/4 cup water. Place the pureed onion in a 2-quart saucepan with additional water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Cook, stirring constantly until the water has almost evaporated. Add the vinegar, tomato juice, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne and hot sauce and mix well. Bring to a boil, and then stir in the sugar. Immediately remove from the heat. Set 1 cup aside for the roast. Let the remaining sauce cool completely, then refrigerate for later use.For the roast: Put the quartered onions in the bottom of a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Mix the brown sugar, paprika, salt and pepper and rub it over the pork roast. Then place in the slow cooker on top of the onions. Drizzle the reserved 1 cup of sauce over the roast. Cook the roast in the slow cooker on low for 10 to 12 hours, checking after 10 hours for tenderness.Remove the meat and onions from the slow cooker. Discard the onions and finely shred the pork. Reserve the juices from the slow cooker to add to the meat for desired juiciness.Serve on a bun with the juice.'

S'Special equipment: a turkey injector, meat thermometer, oil-less fryer and roasting panCombine the mayonnaise, milk, parsley, dill, vinegar, salt, garlic powder, garlic salt and pepper in a blender and process until smooth, about 2 minutes. Measure out 3/4 cup of the ranch dressing and set the remainder aside for serving at the table.Fill a turkey injector with the 3/4 cup ranch dressing and inject 2 tablespoons of the dressing into each thigh of the turkey, 1 tablespoon into each drumstick and 3 tablespoons into each breast. Let the turkey stand at room temperature for 30 minute to let the dressing soak into the meat. Discard any of the unused ranch dressing in the injector (it has been in contact with the raw turkey).Mix together the olive oil and melted butter in a small bowl. Brush the turkey with the oil mixture and then sprinkle with salt.Preheat an oil-less fryer for cooking (alternatively, follow oven-roasting directions below). Place the turkey breast-side up in the fryer with the legs in the deepest part. Cook the turkey until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast reaches 160 degrees F, about 2 hours. (The breast cooks slower than the legs in the oil-less fryer; carryover cooking will cook it the rest of the way through.) Remove the basket insert with the turkey and let the bird rest at least 30 minutes over a roasting pan. Remove the turkey from the basket, carefully dislodging any parts of the turkey that are touching the basket so the skin does not tear. Carve the turkey and serve with the reserved ranch dressing or gravy.Alternatively, roast the turkey in the oven: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Inject the turkey with the dressing as directed above and set it in a roasting pan. Roast, basting every 30 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh reaches 160 degrees F, about 3 hours (the carryover cooking will cook it the rest of the way through). Transfer to a carving board and let rest 30 minutes before carving.'

Season generously with salt and pepper. Set aside.Place 4 cups of the flour in a large bowl or shallow dish. Combine the eggs and 1/4 cup of the milk in a separate bowl. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Flick some flour into the oil; when it sizzles the oil is hot enough. Dredge the steak in the flour, coating both sides and shaking off excess. Dip in the milk and then again in the flour. Fry the steak, a few pieces at a time, until the edges turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.Pour the cooking grease into a heatproof bowl or measuring cup. Without cleaning the skillet, return it to the stove over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup of the drippings to the skillet, scraping up all the brown bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. When the oil is hot, whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup flour until the flour begins to brown, about 2 minutes.

S"Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter three 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust with flour.Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Whisk the granulated sugar and eggs in a separate large bowl until combined. Gradually stir in the vegetable oil. Add the flour mixture, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, stirring well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla and red food coloring.Divide the batter evenly among the pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto racks to finish cooling; peel off the parchment.Make the frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with a mixer until creamy. Beat in the confectioners\\' sugar until the mixture is smooth. Beat in the vanilla and nuts, reserving 2 tablespoons nuts for garnish. (You can make the cakes and/or frosting up to 2 days ahead; wrap the cakes in plastic wrap and refrigerate the frosting.)Spread the frosting between the layers, on the side and on top of the cake. Garnish with the reserved pecans.Photograph by Anna Williams"

Sift the flour and baking powder together in a small bowl and set aside.Using a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on high speed until pale and very thick, 8 to 10 minutes.Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan and cook, scraping the sides and bottom of the pan to prevent burning, until the butter browns and smells nutty, 6 to 8 minutes.Add 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar to the eggs. Add one-third of the flour mixture, then half of the butter, another third of the flour, the remaining butter and the rest of flour, mixing between additions. Whisk until just barely combined. Using a spatula, gently fold the batter until the ingredients are combined. It is very important not to over-whisk or over-fold the batter or it will lose volume. Pour into the prepared pan.In a medium bowl, toss the apples, cinnamon, lemon zest and remaining 2 teaspoons granulated sugar and pour on top of the batter. Sprinkle on the chocolate chips and bake until the cake is golden brown and springs back to the touch, 40 to 50 minutes. Release the pan when cooled and sprinkle the cake with confectioners\\' sugar."

Make a well in the cornmeal and add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. With a fork, stir in enough of the buttermilk to make a batter that is thick but can be easily poured into the hot skillet. You may not need all 3 cups.Carefully pour the batter into the skillet. The oil will come up around the edges. Use the back of a spoon to smooth this over the top of the batter. Continue to heat on the stovetop for 1 minute, and then transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the cornbread until browned on top, about 20 minutes. Immediately turn the cornbread out onto a cooling rack to keep the crust crisp.'

S"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Rub the turkey breast with the butter and sprinkle with salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme. Place the turkey skin-side-up in a large roasting pan and cover with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil. Bake until an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 165 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours or about 15 minutes per pound. Let rest for 10 minutes.Cut the breast into thick slices and set aside. Pour the pan juices into a measuring cup and skim off the fat (use the fat for gravy). You\\'ll need 2 to 3 cups of liquid for the dressing; supplement with chicken stock as needed.In a very large bowl, mix together the crumbled cornbread, torn white bread and the cranberries. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan. Add the celery, carrots and onion and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of the turkey pan juices and continue cooking until the vegetables are translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the cooked vegetables to the bread mixture. Pour in the orange juice and 1 cup of the pan juices and mix well, using a sturdy spoon or your hands. Continue adding pan juices (or chicken stock) until the mixture is very moist, almost soupy. Put the dressing in a 9-by-13-by-2-inch casserole dish. Lay the turkey slices on top of the dressing, using almost all of the meat (reserve the rest for gravy or leftovers). Cover the casserole and refrigerate overnight.The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Remove the casserole from the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature while the oven is heating. Bake until heated through, about 45 minutes. The dressing should be moist. If it appears to have dried out too much overnight, pour another cup of turkey juice over it."

Wrap 2 slices of bacon horizontally around each onion, and secure them with toothpicks. Then put 1 teaspoon of butter in each core. Season with salt and pepper.Place each onion on a square of aluminum foil and bring the edges together at the top, leaving a small opening for steam to escape. Put the foil-wrapped onions on the grill and cook for 1 hour, or until the onions are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. You can also bake in the oven at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Cool the onions for a few minutes then unwrap and cut into quarters to serve.'

S'For the crust: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray; line the bottom with a round of parchment paper; and spray the paper with cooking spray. Place the pan on a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil and bring the foil up around the sides to enclose the seam between the bottom and the sides of the pan (this will prevent water from leaking in).Stir together the graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add the melted butter and mix until the crumbs are coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Set aside.For the filling: In a stand mixer, beat the cream cheese together with the sour cream. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the sugar, cornstarch and vanilla, and beat until smooth.Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Set the foil-wrapped pan inside a larger pan, and carefully pour 1/2 inch of warm water into the larger pan to create a water bath. Bake for 1 hour. Turn off the oven, open the oven door and let the cheesecake stand in the opened oven for 1 hour. Refrigerate the cheesecake for 2 hours or overnight before removing it from the pan.For the sauce: Process the strawberries, sugar and lime zest in a food processor or blender until smooth. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving. (The sauce is best served cold from the refrigerator.)'

S'For the crust: In a food processor, pulse the graham crackers and sugar until crumbs form. Pour in the butter and continue to pulse until the crumbs are coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate. Set aside.For the filling: In a small saucepan, heat the milk until hot but not simmering. To a medium saucepan, add the sugar, flour and cocoa and whisk together well. Lightly beat the egg yolks (saving the whites for the meringue) and pour into the flour mixture. Slowly add the hot milk, stirring. This will create a paste in the beginning, ensuring that the chocolate and flour blend smoothly. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until very thick, about 5 minutes. The mixture will start to bubble sporadically; continue to stir and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, vanilla and salt. Stir until the butter is completely incorporated.Pour the filling into the crust and chill in the refrigerator, about 45 minutes.For the meringue: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the salt until stiff. With the mixer running, gradually add the sugar and beat until the whites are smooth and glossy. Spread the meringue on the pie, reaching the edges of the crust to seal in the filling. Bake until brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely before serving.'

Stir in the salsa, corn, vegetable broth, chili powder, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Transfer the mixture into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, smoothing into an even layer.In a large bowl, mix together the corn muffin mix with about 1 1/2 cups milk, or just enough to make it easy to spread.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Stir in the beaten egg and parsley.To cut pockets into the pork chops, insert the point of a small sharp knife horizontally into the fat-covered edge. Move the knife back and forth to create a deep pocket about 1 1/2 inches wide.Fill the pocket of each chop with the breadcrumb mixture. Secure the openings with toothpicks.Place the flour in a shallow bowl. Dredge the stuffed chops lightly in the flour, shaking off the excess. Wipe out the skillet used previously for the stuffing and place it over medium-high heat. Add the oil and, when hot, add the chops. Sear over medium heat until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side.Place a rack in a roasting or baking pan and add water, being careful not to cover the rack with water. Place the chops on the rack and cover the roaster with the lid or aluminum foil. Bake the chops for 1 hour. Let rest, remove the toothpicks and serve.'

S'In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, salsa and onions until fully combined. Spread the tortillas with the mixture, leaving a 1/2-inch edge. Top each with bacon and ham, then roll into tight cylinders and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least one hour. Remove from fridge, discard the plastic wrap and cut each roll into 1-inch pieces, discarding the uneven ends (or eating them while preparing, like I did!). Each roll should yield eight pieces. If you like, before cutting, stick toothpicks in the rolls at 1-inch intervals; it makes serving a snap.'

S'Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Butter a 1-quart casserole dish or baking pan. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, berries and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer 2 minutes, then remove from the heat and set aside.In a medium bowl, use a pastry blender or two knives to cut the butter into the remaining 2 cups flour. Stir in just enough milk to make a soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured board and pat it into a square. Use a rolling pin to roll it to 1/2 inch thick. Cut the dough into 2-inch-wide strips.Pour 1 cup of the blackberry mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Arrange half of the dough strips on top of the berries, placing them close together. Bake until brown, about 12 minutes, then remove from the oven and pour the remaining berry mixture over the baked strips. Arrange another layer of dough strips on top and bake until brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm with ice cream. Photographs by Johnny Miller'

Sift the flour, baking soda and salt together, and with the mixer running, slowly add to the butter mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips. Scoop out the batter using a mini ice cream scoop and roll it into balls. Place the dough balls about an inch apart on a baking sheet lined with wax paper and transfer them to the freezer for 30 minutes to let the dough set up.For the dipping chocolate: While the dough is chilling, melt the chocolate wafers and chocolate-almond bark together in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove the chilled dough balls from the freezer. Using two spoons, dip the balls one at a time in the melted chocolate, rolling them to coat fully. Returned the dough balls to the wax paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.'

S"For the skillet apple pie: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Melt the butter in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet; set aside 1 tablespoon of the melted butter for the top crust. To the melted butter, add the brown sugar and melt them together on medium heat, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and line the skillet with one of the pie crusts. Pour the apple pie filling over the crust and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon sugar. Use the second pie crust to cover the filling. Brush the top with the reserved melted butter, then evenly sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar on top. Cut vents in the middle of the pie. Bake for 30 minutes. Serve hot, topped with a generous dollop of cinnamon whipped cream.For the cinnamon whipped cream: Chill a large metal mixing bowl and a wire beater attachment in the freezer for about 20 minutes. Pour the cream, cinnamon and sugar into the cold mixing bowl and beat until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes; the mixture should hold its shape when dropped from a spoon.

S'For the chicken: Put the chicken pieces in a large bowl and cover them with water. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons salt in the water, cover the bowl, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. When you soak the chicken overnight in salt brine, the salt infuses into the meat and makes it so tasty!Pour oil into an electric frying pan or deep, heavy skillet to a 1-inch depth and heat the oil to 375 degrees F. Check the temperature by sprinkling flour over the oil. If the flour sizzles, the oil is hot enough.Drain the water from the chicken, sprinkle each piece with some salt and pepper, and coat the pieces with flour, shaking off any excess. Carefully place the chicken in the hot oil. Place the cover on the pan, leaving a small opening for steam to escape. Cook for 15 minutes.Remove the cover and, using tongs, turn each piece of chicken. Replace the cover and cook for 15 minutes more, or until done. Use a sharp, thin-bladed knife to check for doneness by slicing a drumstick to the bone. Neither the meat nor the juices should be pink. Drain the chicken on paper towels and keep warm.For the gravy: Spoon about 4 tablespoons of oil that the chicken was fried in plus the brown bits into a medium skillet. Over medium heat, sprinkle in the flour and cook while whisking, until the flour is browned, about 1 minute.Slowly stir in the milk and cook until the gravy thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve with the chicken.'

Add the pork and coat well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 24 hours.The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet. Remove the tenderloins from the marinade and put them in the hot oil. Sear on all sides, then return the pork to the baking dish with the marinade. Add the chopped red onion to the skillet, saute until translucent, then add it to the baking dish. Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake for 20 minutes.In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce along with the honey, marmalade, and tomato-vegetable juice. When 20 minutes are up, remove the pork from the oven, remove the foil, and with a very sharp knife cut deep slits into the meat. Pour the honey sauce into these slits and over the meat. Slice the unpeeled oranges into 1/4-inch crosswise pieces and arrange the slices on the top and sides of tenderloins. Return the meat to the oven and bake, uncovered, until the orange slices begin to curl, about 15 additional minutes.

S"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Put the softened cheese and butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer. Using the heaviest mixer paddle attachment, beat until the mixture has the consistency of whipped cream, 15 to 30 minutes.In a large bowl, sift 3 cups of the flour with the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Gradually add the seasoned flour to the cheese mixture by large spoonfuls, beating well after each addition. Add the remaining 1 cup unseasoned flour incrementally until the dough is somewhat stiff but still soft enough to be pushed through a cookie press; you may not need to add all the flour.Lightly spray 4 cookie sheets with cooking spray. Put a portion of the dough into a cookie press fitted with the star tube and press the dough onto a cookie sheet in long strips that run the length of the pan. Repeat until the pan is full. Bake until straws are golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.With your hands or a sharp knife, break or cut the long strips into 3-inch lengths. Use a flat, thin spatula or an egg turner to remove the cheese strips from the pan. Allow them to cool on a wire rack. When they are completely cool, serve or store in a tightly covered container.Cook\\'s Note: If you don\\'t have a cookie press, form the dough into 1-inch balls and flatten them with a fork."

S'Place the pork and chicken in a 1 1/2 gallon stock pot with enough water to cover. Cook at a medium simmer for 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender, skimming occasionally. Remove the meat to a bowl and reserve the stock. Meanwhile, in a separate large stockpot, do the same to the beef. Remove the beef and discard the broth.Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with water and simmer until tender.Remove and discard the bones and skin from all of the cooked meat, pull apart or cut into chunks and process in a food processor or meat grinder until ground. Put 2 pints of the reserved pork and chicken stock into a 1 1/2 gallon stock pot, reserve the rest for another use. Add the ground meats to the stock. Dissolve the black pepper and the cayenne pepper in 1 tablespoon water, and add to the stew.Add to the onion and tomato to the food processor, process well and add it to the meat mixture with the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Process in the food processor the cooked potatoes, then add to the stew, stirring until any lumps are removed. Stir in the salt. At this point, the stew should be soupy not watery. If the stew is too thick to stir easily with a flat spatula or pancake turner, thin it slightly with more reserved pork and chicken stock. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring constantly.Puree and add the corn, then continue to cook the stew over very low heat for 1 hour, stirring often and scraping the bottom of the stock pot with a flat spatula or pancake turner to avoid scorching.'

Dredge the chicken pieces in the eggs and then in the flour-cheese mixture.Add 2 tablespoons of the butter to the heated olive oil, and when the butter melts, add the floured chicken breasts. Cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Transfer the chicken to a platter and set aside. Cook your chicken in batches if they don\\'t all fit comfortably in the pan.Add the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and the garlic to the skillet drippings. Saute the garlic for 30 seconds, being careful not to burn it. Add the chicken broth and capers to the skillet, stirring to mix. Cook the liquid over medium-low heat until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the vinegar and lemon juice and heat through.Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning some of the sauce over the chicken. Cover the skillet and cook over medium heat until the sauce bubbles and the chicken is cooked through, an additional 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve."

S'Put the cashews in a bowl and add cold water to cover them. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.The next day, drain the cashews and rinse under cold water. Put them in a blender with enough fresh cold water just to cover them. Blend on high for several minutes until smooth. Strain the cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any remaining bits of cashew. Store refrigerated for 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 3 months.Yield: 2 1/4 cupsWhen blending hot liquids, first let cool for 5 minutes or so, then transfer to a blender, filling only halfway. Put the lid on, leaving one corner open; this will prevent the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters and pulse until smooth.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.For the filling: Place the chicken breasts in a large stockpot along with 2 teaspoons of the salt and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate to cool, reserving 3 cups of the broth; supplement with canned chicken stock if you are short. When cool enough to handle, cut the chicken into bite-size pieces.While the chicken is cooking, combine the potatoes and the remaining 2 teaspoons salt in a medium stockpot. Fill with water to cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and cook until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and set aside to cool.Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the carrots and cook for 5 minutes. Add the celery, onion and a pinch of salt and pepper; cook until the onions are soft and almost translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and, once melted, add the flour to make a roux. Cook the flour for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, then add the milk and reserved chicken broth. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the chicken, corn, peas, celery seeds and garlic powder. Remove from the heat.Grease eight 10-ounce ramekins with butter and place on a large, rimmed baking sheet or jellyroll pan. (Alternatively, grease one 9-by-13-inch baking dish.)Evenly divide the potatoes among the ramekins. Spoon the filling over the potatoes, leaving about 1/4-inch of space at the top for the crust.For the crust: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the baking mix and pepper until well blended. Whisk in the melted butter and buttermilk until smooth. Stir in the Parmesan. Pour some batter into each ramekin and smooth over the top, being careful not to mix it into the filling. Bake until the crust is crispy and nicely browned, 40 to 45 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.'

Spread the leek mixture evenly over the potatoes. Arrange the apples in an overlapping layer on the leeks. Brush the apples with the remaining tablespoon of oil and sprinkle with the Parmesan. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake 40 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until the Parmesan is golden brown and melted, about 20 minutes more. The tip of a paring knife should easily pierce the apples and potatoes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.'
