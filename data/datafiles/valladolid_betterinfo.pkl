S"For the brine: Combine the salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, coriander seeds, and 2 cups warm water in a large bowl. Stir until the salt dissolves. Add 6 cups cold water. Add the pork, cover, and refrigerate overnight (the pork should be submerged in the liquid).Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.For the herb rub: Mix the garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl. Remove the pork from the brine and pat it dry (discard the brine). Spread the herb mixture over the pork loin, making sure you coat all sides of the loin.For the pork: Heat the olive oil in a medium, heavy saute pan over high heat. Add the pork and sear until browned, 4 minutes. Carefully turn the pork over and sear until browned, another 4 minutes. Meanwhile, add the prunes and pearl onions to a 10 by 7 by 2-inch glass baking dish, creating a bed for the loin. Transfer the seared pork loin to the baking dish (making sure the loin fits in the baking dish, leaving a 1-inch border on every side).Add the wine to the same saute pan used to sear the pork and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan to remove the browned bits, until almost evaporated, about1 minute. Stir in the pineapple juice and remove from the heat. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the pork. Season the prunes and onions with salt and pepper.Place the pork in the oven and roast until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 160 degrees F, about 1 hour, basting with the pan juices every 20 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board, tent with foil, and let it stand for 10 minutes. Slice the pork into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices and arrange on a platter. Top the pork slices with the pearl onions, prunes, and sauce.Cook\\'s Note: In place of a 3 1/2-pound pork loin, you can use 2 (1 1/4-pound) pork tenderloins. The total cooking time will be about 1 hour."

Thinly shred the leaves and set aside.Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, celery and onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 3 more minutes; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl and reserve.In the same saucepan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until no pink remains. Add the cooked onion mixture, oregano and thyme, and stir to combine. Add the beef broth and bring to a simmer. Add the flour and brown sugar and cook until the pork is completely cooked through and the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Season the filling with salt and pepper.Lay one sheet of phyllo on a work surface. Using a pastry brush, spread melted butter evenly over the sheet. Top with another phyllo sheet and brush melted butter over the surface; repeat with 2 more layers of phyllo. Cut the phyllo stack into 12 even squares. Repeat this process with the remaining 4 phyllo sheets so there are a total of 24 cut squares.Divide the shredded cabbage among the 24 phyllo squares, mounding it in the center of each square. Top the cabbage with about 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture, dividing it evenly among the squares. Brush the outer edges of each square with a little butter. Working one square at a time, bring the corners of the phyllo up and over the filling, twisting gently to create a purse. Transfer to a baking sheet and brush the outsides with a little melted butter.Bake until the dough is crisp and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately while still warm.'

Since it\\'s fresh, you will need to remove the casing before cooking it. They can be found at most supermarkets. Also, some chorizos are very salty so watch the seasoning!A great filling for soft tacos, just add shredded cheese, beans or your favorite taco filling!"

S"For the chicken broth: Rinse the chicken and pat dry. Place all 8 pieces of chicken in a large heavy pot with 8 cups boiling water. Add the garlic, onion and salt. Bring to a boil again. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for about 1 hour. Remove the chicken and set aside. Maintain a medium heat under the broth as you\\'ll use it again for this recipe.For the roasted vegetables: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the tomatoes, onion and garlic onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and roast until the skins are blistered and the vegetables softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool. Once cooled, remove the foil and peel the garlic and the skins off the tomatoes.For the mole: In a large heavy saute pan heat 1 cup lard. Quick fry the chiles in the hot lard, being careful not to burn them or they\\'ll become bitter. Add the chiles into the pot of chicken broth and simmer for 10 minutes.In the meantime, add 2 tablespoons lard to the saute pan and fry the roasted onions and garlic. Add the tortilla and bolillo and cook for 5 minutes. Add the peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, blanched almonds, raisins, oregano, cumin, thyme, coriander seeds, whole black peppercorns and cinnamon stick. Saute for 4 minutes and remove from the heat. Cool slightly. Remove the cinnamon stick and discard.Working in two batches, transfer half of the cooled nut and seed mixture into a large-capacity blender. Then transfer half of the simmered chiles, without the broth, into the blender. Add half of the roasted tomatoes and fresh tomatillos. Allow to cool before blending. Process until smooth. A paste will form. If the mixture is too dry, add 1 cup of reserved chicken broth at a time. Strain the mixture into a large mixing bowl. Then repeat with the remaining ingredients, processing until smooth and then strain.Clean the saute pan and place over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons lard. Pour in the strained mole sauce and cook for 2 minutes. Season with the salt, some pepper and the sugar. Add 1 1/2 cups of the reserved chicken broth and stir to combine. Add the Mexican chocolate and stir to melt. Simmer for 15 minutes, uncovered. Return the chicken to the saucepan with the mole and cook until the chicken is warmed through, an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large serving bowl or platter. Sprinkle with some sesame seeds and a couple pinches of sugar if desired. Drizzle the Mexican crema over the chicken mole and serve hot.When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth."

S'In a large heavy saute pan, heat the oil on medium high heat. Saute the onions and potato until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the chorizo and saute until fully cooked, crisp and browned, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes and the chorizo to a medium mixing bowl and allow to cool.Heat the tortillas directly on the gas burner, about 10 seconds per side, until just soft and pliable. Place 2 tablespoons of the chorizo and potato mixture onto the warmed tortilla and roll tightly to form a cigar.In a separate heavy saute pan, heat enough oil to come 1-inch up the sides of a pan. When oil is hot, gently place a rolled tortilla in to fry. Fry on all sides until golden in color, about 4 minutes. Continue working in batches until done with all 10 tortillas. Cut in half and transfer to a serving platter. Top with some lettuce, drizzle with Mexican crema and crumbled queso fresco. Serve with any store-bought red salsa.'

S'Combine the garlic, onions, salt and 5 cups water in a 12-inch high-sided saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the chicken breasts and bay leaf, and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook the chicken, partially covered, until cooked through, about 35 minutes. (To check for doneness, slit the chicken in half to make sure the interior is no longer pink.) Remove the chicken (reserve the broth) and allow to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, shred by hand and place in a medium bowl.Remove enough broth to leave about 2 cups in the pan with the onions and garlic (cool and refrigerate or freeze the extra broth for another use). Remove the bay leaf. Add the tomatillos and jalapenos and cook until the tomatillos are olive green, 10 to 12 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the solid ingredients (onions, tomatillos and garlic) to a blender. Add the cilantro and process until smooth (using some of the liquid in the pan if needed). Season with salt and pepper. Pour the salsa back into the saucepan and bring to a boil; add the chicken and cook until the flavors incorporate, about 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.To assemble the empanadas: Dust a flat surface with flour. Roll out the pizza dough about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Using a 6-inch round cookie cutter (or a bowl or plate with the same diameter), cut the dough into circles. Expect to get about 3 circles from 1 pound of dough. Brush the egg wash over the surface of one dough round. Add 2 tablespoons of filling onto half of the circle and sprinkle about 1 ounce of mozzarella on top of the filling, if using. Fold the plain half over the filling. Seal the edges with fork tines or crimp decoratively. Repeat for the remaining empanadas. (Save any leftover filling in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week for another use.)Transfer the empanadas to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of the empanadas with the egg wash. Bake until crisp and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.'

S'Sprinkle the gelatin in 1/2 cup water. Let stand about 2 minutes to soften. Microwave on high for 45 seconds. Stir for 15 seconds, until the gelatin is dissolved.In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the evaporated milk until hot, making sure not to boil. Whisk in the cajeta until smooth and evenly incorporated. Stir in the gelatin mixture to the cajeta mixture and turn the heat off to cool slightly.In a large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the cream cheese and beat on medium speed while slowly adding 1/3 cup of the cajeta cream to temper the cream cheese and avoid curdling or separation. Gradually add the remaining cajeta cream and continue beating until smooth. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and beat again until fully incorporated and frothy. Strain the cream into a glass pitcher or into a 4-cup liquid measure, maintaining as much froth as possible. Pour 1 cup of the cream into each of the 4 wine glasses.Garnish with 3 to 5 fresh raspberries (the raspberries will remain afloat in the froth). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.'

S'For the salmon: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray.Heat the oil in a heavy saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook until translucent and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until the liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach and wilt for 4 minutes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Let cool.Dust a flat working surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out the sheets of puff pastry into 1/4-inch thickness (each 12 by 12 inches). Put the pastry sheets side-by-side so they overlap slightly, by about 1/2 inch. Brush the overlapping strip with the beaten egg, stick both sheets together at the strip and seal with a fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.Spoon the cooled mushroom-spinach mixture over one side of the puff pastry rectangle. To make an even rectangle out of the salmon fillet, you can cut the top portion off of the belly and add it to the tail part. Place the fillet over the mushroom-spinach mixture. Season the salmon heavily with salt and pepper. Fold the other side of the rectangle over the filling and seal by brushing the edge with egg wash and crimping as you would a pie crust (you can use a fork; I crimped like a pie crust with my fingers). Fold the remaining 2 open edges of pastry under the salmon fillet. Brush everything with the egg wash.Bake until the puff pastry is crisp and golden in color, 25 minutes. Let stand for about 8 minutes before slicing.For the dill sauce: Put the clam juice in a heavy saucepot and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and reduce to 1/2 cup. Add the Mexican crema and heavy cream and reduce to 1 cup. Add the flour and whisk while boiling until thickened. Add the dill and season with salt and pepper.Slice the salmon into 1 1/4 to 1 1/2-inch slices. Serve immediately with the dill sauce.'

S'Combine the Maggi sauce, water, lime juice, garlic, chile, salt, and pepper, to taste, in a medium-size bowl.  Slowly add the 1/2 cup of olive oil, whisking constantly.Add the beef to the marinade, making sure each piece is coated with the mixture.  Transfer the meat and the marinade to a quart-size freezer bag.  Seal and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or preferably overnight. Allow the meat to come to room temperature before cooking, about 30 minutes. Remove the meat from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Discard the marinade.In a large heavy pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Sear the meat on all sides, a few pieces at a time, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the browned meat to a platter and set aside.Add the onions, peppers, garlic, and chiles to the hot pan.  Saute for 5 minutes, then add the beef broth, tomatoes, oregano, salt and pepper, to taste. Mix well, then return the meat to the pan. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer slowly until the meat is very tender, about 2 hours. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and allow to rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Continue to cook the onion mixture until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.Using your fingers or 2 forks, shred the meat into 2-inch-long pieces. Return the shredded meat to the pot, stir to combine, and cook until meat is very hot, about 3 minutes.Warm the tortillas over a burner or in a dry skillet over medium heat for 20 seconds. Put about 2 tablespoons of the meat mixture in the center of each tortilla, and roll into a thin burrito. Arrange them on a serving platter and garnish with lime wedges.'

Add the onions and saute until translucent and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatillos and cook for 1 minute. Add the chipotle, salt, pepper, Mexican oregano and the sprigs of marjoram and thyme. Add the shredded chicken. Continue cooking for another 3 minutes. Add between 1/2 cup and 1 cup of the chicken cooking liquid, depending on the thickness of the sauce. Cook for 5 more minutes. Remove the marjoram and thyme sprigs.To assemble: Place 2 tablespoons of tinga on each tostada. Serve immediately.'

S'Heat the oil in a medium-size heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, and saute for until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook until the rice is opaque, about 10 minutes. Stir in the water and the corn kernels, then season the water with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, about for 15 minutes.Preheat a broiler. Using a fork, fluff the rice and stir in the chopped poblanos. Transfer the rice to a 7 by 10-inch baking dish.  Drizzle with the creama or sour cream and sprinkle the cheese over the top.  Broil until the top is browned in spots and the cheese has melted, about 5 to 8 minutes.Remove from the oven and serve.*Cooks Note: To char the chiles (or any fresh chile): Put the chiles over a gas flame or underneath the broiler and cook until they are blackened on all sides. Enclose them in a plastic bag and let stand for 10 minutes to steam, which will make them easier to peel. Peel, stem, and seed the chiles. Once peeled, the chiles may be chopped, sliced or stuffed.'

Using a  slotted spoon,  remove the chorizo and drain on paper towels. Add to the beans. Season lightly with salt, if necessary. Stir the  beans over medium-high heat until heated through. Remove the bay leaf and ham hock and discard. Ladle into bowls and serve.Cook\\'s Note: In place of soaking the beans, you can use 3 (15-ounce) cans rinsed and drained pinto beans.

Let stand at least 5 minutes and up to 30 minutes.Whip the heavy cream in a bowl to the soft-peak stage. Refrigerate until ready to use.Spread the butter on both sides of each pound cake slice and grill, turning once, until light golden, about 1 minute per side. Drain the pineapple, reserving the syrup, and grill, turning once, until grill marks appear, about 1 minute per side.To assemble, place each pound cake slice on a dessert plate and top with 2 pineapple rings. Drizzle a little of the tequila syrup over each plate, top with a dollop of whipped cream and garnish with a mint sprig and some chopped mint.'

S'For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two 9-inch cake pans with nonstick cooking spray.Combine the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix on low until well combined (the mixture will be one uniform color). With the machine running on low, add the milk, boiling water, vegetable oil, vanilla and eggs. Mix on high, scraping down the sides as needed, until well combined and the mixture has air bubbles, about 1 minute.Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans and bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool about 10 minutes in the pans. Run a thin knife around the edge of each cake, then invert the cakes onto a rack and let cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes.Using a serrated knife, cut a small portion from the top of each cake to completely flatten it. Save the trimmings for another use.For the frosting: When ready to assemble the cake, combine the powdered sugar and butter in a food processor and pulse until well combined. Add the chocolate and continue to pulse, scraping down the sides as needed. Add the sour cream and process until very smooth, about 1 minute.Place one cake layer on a platter and spread half of the frosting on top. Flip over the second cake layer, making sure the flattened side is facing the bottom, and place on top of the first cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting to cover only the top of the cake (leave the sides without frosting). Serve.'

S'Cook\\\'s Notes: Queso Fresco is a white, mild, fresh Mexican cheese with the texture of fresh farmer\\\'s cheese in the US. Queso fresco can be found in many supermarkets, or can also substituted with a mild feta cheese.The pasilla is a Mexican dried chile, also known as "ancho" or "chile negro" in the U.S. It is often used in moles and other Mexican sauces. It also can be sold as a fresh chile in the U.S. \\u2014 similar to the poblano. They can be found at most supermarkets, Latin specialty markets or online.Ibarra chocolate is a brand of Mexican chocolate that can be purchased in most national supermarkets. If you cannot find Ibarra or any Mexican chocolate, you can substitute one ounce of Mexican chocolate for: 1 ounce of semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and one drop of almond extract.From Food Network Kitchens: After further testing and to ensure the best results, this recipe has been altered from what was in the actual episode.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Put the drained beans and chicken broth in a large bowl.In a saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, tomato, chile, and garlic. Saute until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Rub the oregano, between palms of your hands and sprinkle over the beans. Add salt and pepper, to taste.  Add the beans and broth to the pan and simmer for 10 minutes.  Cool the beans for about 5 minutes before putting them in the blender. Carefully, pour the mixture into a blender and puree. Return the pureed mixture to the pan and gently reheat over medium-low heat, stirring frequently.Using tongs, pass the tortillas 1 by 1 through the refried bean sauce until they are somewhat softened and coated on both sides with the sauce.  Set aside on a plate.  Fill each tortilla with 1/4 cup of shredded cheese. Fold in half and arrange them, overlapping, in a 9 by 13-inch baking dish.  Top with an additional 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the bean sauce, just enough to cover the beans but allow the edges of the folded tortillas to show. Bake until cheese is melted about 10 to 15 minutes.To serve, drizzle with Mexican sour cream lengthwise in a 2-inch thick strip down the center of the dish.  Top with 8 overlapping red onion rings.'

S'For the pulled pork: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and slightly softened, about 2 more minutes. Add the achiote paste and mix well to incorporate. Add the orange and pineapple juices and bring to a boil. Once it boils, turn the heat off and carefully transfer to a blender. Cool. Process the mixture until smooth, about 2 minutes. Set aside.Sprinkle the pork butt heavily with salt and pepper on all sides. Arrange the orange skins on the bottom of a 5 1/2- to 6-quart slow cooker, skin-side up (this adds more flavor to the pork and ensures the meat will not dry out). Scatter the pork butt on top of the oranges. Pour the achiote puree inside the slow cooker. Cover the slow cooker and turn on to high heat. Let it cook until the pork is tender and ready to shred, about 5 hours.Turn the slow cooker off and remove the oranges from the pot and discard. Let the pork cool slightly before shredding. Using two forks or with clean hands, shred the pork. Return the shredded meat to the slow cooker filled with sauce and keep warm until ready to serve.For the pickled habaneros: Mix the habanero chiles, lime juice, olive oil, oregano and salt together in a small bowl. Mix well to incorporate. Let stand at least 20 minutes. They can be made 1 day ahead.For the pickled red onions: Mix the lime juice, olive oil, oregano, salt and onions together in a medium bowl. Mix well to incorporate. Let stand for 30 minutes. They can be made 1 day ahead.Serve the pork in the warmed corn tortillas with pickled habaneros and red onions, shredded cabbage and crema.'

S"With an electric mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the butter until light and fluffy. Add the granulated sugar and beat until well blended. Beat in the flour, and then the chopped and ground walnuts. Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a large disc. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator. Cut the dough into quarters, and then cut each quarter into sixths for a total of 24 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough between your palms into 2-inch balls. Arrange the 24 balls onto the prepared baking sheets (12 cookies on each sheet), spacing them 1 inch apart. Bake the cookies until golden brown on the bottom and just pale golden on top, 20 to 25 minutes.Cool the cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Toss the warm cookies in the confectioners\\' sugar. Transfer the sugarcoated cookies to a rack to cool completely. (The cookies can be prepared 2 days ahead.

Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.Meanwhile, mix the cheese and oregano in a small bowl. Season with some salt and pepper.To remove the seeds from the jalapenos, make a crosswise cut at the stem-end of the jalapeno and then slice lengthwise down the middle, being careful not to cut the jalapeno completely in half. Peel open the sides of the jalapeno and, using a spoon, gently scrape out the seeds and veins. Fill the cavities with 1 tablespoon of the cheese-oregano mixture. Then wrap 1 slice of bacon tightly around the stuffed jalapeno to seal in the cheese. Transfer to the hot grill (try to place the jalapeno on the grill on the side where the bacon ends). Grill until the bacon is crisp and fully cooked, 5 minutes. Serve immediately.'

Sear the chicken, breast-side down, until grill marks appear, about 6 minutes. Brush some adobo sauce on the other side of the chicken. Turn the chicken breast-side up, place in a baking pan and transfer to the oven. Cook the chicken, basting with the extra adobo sauce every 20 minutes, until a meat thermometer registers an inner temperature of 165 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Serve with corn tortillas to prepare tacos and lime wedges.Cook\\'s Note: When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth."

Brush the chicken breast with olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, to taste. Put the chicken on a small sheet pan and roast until fully cooked through, about 25 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to cool before shredding.In a medium shallow skillet heat enough vegetable oil to come half way up the sides of the pan.  Shred the chicken into small pieces and put about 2 tablespoons down the center of each corn tortilla. Roll up each tortilla like a cigar and secure them with a toothpick. Fry the tacos until golden brown on all sides, turning once, about 4 minutes total. Remove the toothpicks and cut each taco in half.To serve: Top with shredded lettuce and freshly made salsa. Drizzle with Mexican crema and sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco.Cook\\'s Note: *Before rolling flautas heat up tortillas directly over a gas flame (or dry skillet) to make them nice and pliable."

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Using 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, grease the sliced surface of the squash and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Arrange on a baking sheet and roast until very tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.In a large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the remaining olive oil, onion, celery, and carrot, then season with a pinch of salt. Saute until just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 2 minutes.  Scoop the butternut squash flesh into the pot and stir. Add 4 cups of the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until the vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.Turn off the heat and using an immersion blender, carefully puree the soup until very smooth. If necessary, add more of the remaining stock to create desired consistency. Mix in 2 teaspoons of the chipotle into the soup, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.In a small bowl, mix together 1 teaspoon of chipotle and the sour cream. Season the chipotle cream with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the soup to bowls. Top each with a dollop of chipotle cream and serve.Cook\\\'s Notes: Serve this hearty bisque for dinner on a cool autumn night, or pour it into individual shot glasses for a savvy appetizer.A chipotle chile is a smoked, dried jalapeno. They can be found dried, pickled or canned "in adobo" which is a sauce made with ground chiles, herbs, vinegar and spices. The sauce tends to be more mild than the chipotles themselves and can be used in place of them to reduce the heat in a dish. Dried or canned chipotles are easily found in most supermarkets.'

S'Prepare a grill or grill pan to high heat.Grill the jalapenos, turning them occasionally, until charred on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Transfer them to a cutting board and let cool for 5 minutes. Keep the grill on high heat.Using a small paring knife, peel the jalapenos.  Scrape out and discard the seeds and veins.  Coarsely chop the chiles and transfer them to a medium bowl.  Add the butter, garlic, and parsley and mash together.  Season the jalapeno butter with salt and pepper, to taste.  Put a square piece of plastic wrap on a work surface.  Spoon the jalapeno butter onto the center and roll it up into a 1-inch-diameter log.  Refrigerate it until firm, at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 week.Grill the corn on the hot grill or grill pan, turning occasionally, until it is browned in spots and the kernels are tender, about 15 minutes.  Transfer the ears to a platter.  Top each ear with a pat of the jalapeno butter, sprinkle with queso fresco, and serve.'

S'Heat the olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds until aromatic. Add the chicken broth, bell pepper, honey, ginger, vinegar, and chipotle chile, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 2 1/2 hours. Add the raspberries and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and let the chutney cool slightly. Stir in the cilantro and season with salt and black pepper, to taste. (Chutney can be prepared 3 days in advance. Cool and store in the refrigerator).Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry into a 12-inch square. Cut the pastry into 2 to 3-inch squares.  Put the squares on the prepared baking sheet. Using a small cookie cutter score a circle in the center of each square or using a paring knife, score a 1/2-inch border around the edge of each square.  Bake the squares until puffed and golden, about 12 minutes.  Remove the scored, top section of the cooked pastry and fill with some of the goat cheese. Spoon a generous dollop of the chipotle-raspberry chutney on top of the goat cheese.  Arrange on a serving platter and serve.'

S'Cook\\\'s Note: In Mexico, pico de gallo is used to describe a wide variety of regional salsas, which are always made with fresh cubed fruit and/or vegetables. The most common version is made with any red tomato, onion and green chiles and is sometimes called "salsa mexicana" or "salsa bandera," because the colors in the salsa represent the Mexican flag.*The serrano chile is a fresh, small, green chile. Traditionally used in salsas it is slightly hotter than a jalapeno chile and can be found at most supermarkets, Latin specialty markets or online.'

Pick up the 2 long sides of the corn husk and bring them together. Roll both sides of the corn husks in the same direction over the filling.Repeat with remaining corn husks and dough. Arrange the tamales, seam side down, in a steamer and add 1/2-inch of water. Cover with a tight fitting lid, bring to a simmer and steam for 1 hour, adding additional water, as needed to maintain 1/2-inch of water in the pan. Remove the tamales from the steamer to a serving platter and serve.'

S'In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter until bubbling hot. In a blender, add the egg yolks, black pepper, to taste, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Cover the blender and blend on high speed for several seconds. Either remove center cap of the blender lid or carefully remove the lid itself with blender still running.  Pour the hot butter in a thin, steady stream into whirling egg mixture. Add the chipotle and pulse to combine. Taste sauce and adjust seasoning with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. (If your sauce gets too thick, you can thin it out with a couple tablespoons of boiling hot water.)For the eggs:In a heavy saucepan combine about 2 quarts of water and the vinegar and bring to a simmer. Break 1 egg into a small bowl or cup and slide the egg into a ladle. Lower the ladle into the water, and hold it there, for 1 minute before removing the ladle and leaving the egg to cook for 2 minutes more. Poach at a low simmer until the whites are firm and the yolks are still runny. Repeat with each remaining egg. Transfer the eggs, with a slotted spoon, to paper towels until ready to serve.To assemble:Arrange a croissant half, cut side up, on each of 4 plates. Put 1 piece of prosciutto on each half, then 2 poached eggs and top with hollandaise. Serve immediately.*RAW EGG WARNINGFood Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell.**Cook\\\'s Note: The chipotle chile is a smoked, dried jalapeno. They can be found dried, pickled or canned "in adobo" which is a sauce made with ground chiles, herbs, vinegar and spices. The sauce tends to be more mild than the chipotles themselves and can be used in place of them to reduce the heat in a dish. Both dried and canned chipotles are easily found in most supermarkets.'

Refrigerate for 10 to 20 minutes to solidify the butter.For the cream filling: Using a hand-held mixer, whip the cream cheese and butter at medium speed until fluffy with minimal lumps. Add the powdered sugar and cinnamon, whipping at low speed until just combined and being careful not to curdle the butter. Add the cream and whip to soft peaks.To assemble the pie: Spread the dulce de leche on top of the chilled crust. Top with the sliced bananas, forming 2 layers if necessary. Pour the whipped cream on top and spread evenly to completely cover the banana layer. Refrigerate and chill until set, about 2 hours.To serve, top the pie with a 1-inch border of the remaining chopped peanuts. Warm the remaining dulce de leche in the microwave or on the stovetop until melted. Drizzle the dulce de leche on top of the pie and serve.'

Mix to combine.Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is sizzling hot, place the mixture in separate piles like pancakes. Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer hash browns to a paper-lined plate and drain.

S"In a medium heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the pork, ground sirloin, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, salt and pepper and cook at medium heat until meat loses its pink color and is cooked through, about 7 minutes. Add the dried apples, apricots, and sweetened pineapple and remove from the heat. Add the ground cinnamon and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Set aside. Remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaf and discard.Sauce: Put the walnuts, Mexican crema and goat cheese in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth and silky, about 2 minutes. Sauce should coat the back of a spoon. (If the sauce is too thin, add more walnuts and puree. If too thick, add more cream.) Season with salt, to taste.Cut a lengthwise slit into each chile and carefully cut out seeds with kitchen shears, leaving the stem intact. (For less spice, carefully remove the veins.)Spoon the filling into the chiles, then close, slightly overlapping the sides of the openings. Transfer the stuffed chiles, seam sides up, to plates and pour about 1/3 cup the walnut sauce over each chile, leaving some of the chile visible. Sprinkle with parsley leaves and pomegranate seeds. Serve warm or at room temperature.*Cook\\'s Note: To peel the walnuts: Cook in boiling water for 1 minute and drain. When cool enough to handle, use a paring knife to remove the skins. Peeling the walnuts before adding them to the sauce will make a smoother, whiter sauce. Unpeeled walnuts can be used, but the texture will be a little grainy and slightly bitter."

S'Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Place the chiles and 2 cups of chicken broth in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and then turn off the heat. Let the chiles stand for 5 to 10 minutes to soften.Mix 3/4 cup of chicken broth, melted butter, and tequila in a small metal bowl. Season with salt. Using a kitchen flavor injector, inject the mixture into the thighs, breasts, and legs of the turkey. If the mixture solidifies, place the bowl over a gas burner or in a warm oven until the butter melts.Place the turkey on a rack set in a large roasting pan. Tuck the wing tips under the turkey body. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Place the giblets in the pan.Transfer the chiles with their liquid to a blender. Add the apricot preserves, oregano, and garlic and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Transfer the chile puree to a medium saucepan. Rub about 1 cup of the chile puree all over the turkey (reserve the rest for the sauce at the end), working some of it between the breast and the skin. Season the turkey generously with salt and pepper.Add 1 cup broth to the roasting pan and roast for 45 minutes.Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Continue roasting the turkey until a thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 2 hours longer, basting every 20 minutes with drippings. Cover the turkey loosely with foil if it begins to brown.Transfer the turkey to a platter, reserving the pan juices, and allow to rest while preparing the sauce.Strain the pan juices into a large, heavy saucepan and discard any solids. Spoon the fat from the top of the liquid and discard. Add the remaining chile puree to the saucepan and stir until well combined. Boil over high heat until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Garnish the turkey with dried apricots, dried chiles, and fresh cilantro. Serve with the chile puree alongside.'

S'Combine the beans, garlic, onion, and bay leaves in a medium pot.  Add enough water to reach about 1 1/2 inches over the beans.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the beans are tender, about 2 hours. Add more water if the beans are absorbing too much liquid. The beans should be soupy when done, with plenty of liquid remaining. Season the beans with salt and pepper, to taste.   Ladle the beans and cooking liquid into soup bowls and garnish with Mexican crema, cilantro and chopped white onions.  Alternatively, the beans can be drained and use as a filling for soft tacos.'

Season the dressing, to taste, with additional salt and pepper.Using a paring knife and working over a large bowl to catch the juice, remove the peel and white pith from the oranges. Cut between the membranes to remove the segments directly into the bowl. Squeeze any excess juice from the membranes directly into the bowl and discard the membranes. Add the watercress and dried cranberries. Toss with the orange juice and season with salt and pepper, to taste.To serve: Spread 1 side of the jicama slices with a little of the dressing. Using the jicama slices as you would a tortilla, place the watercress salad in the center of each jicama slice and fold to make tacos.Cook\\'s Note: The dressing can also be made by hand. Use a fork to mash the avocado until smooth and add the lime zest and juice. Whisking constantly, drizzle in the oil until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste."

Grease a 12-inch tart pan with removable bottom with some oil.Pulse the butter, sugar, salt and cookies in a food processor until combined. Firmly press the crumb mixture into the prepared tart pan (the mixture will come only halfway up the sides). Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely.For the filling: In a heavy saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add the milk and 1 cup water and continue to whisk until the cornstarch is dissolved. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking, until the mixture comes to a boil, 3 to 5 minutes; it will start to thicken to a custard-like texture.In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Gradually mix the yolks into the thickened cornstarch mixture in the saucepan. Continue to whisk until combined, then remove from the heat. Whisk in the butter and lemon zest and juice. Let cool slightly, then whisk in the tequila. Cover the filling with plastic wrap and set aside.For the meringue: With an electric mixer in a large bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar and a pinch of salt until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. On slow speed, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form, another 1 to 2 minutes.Pour the filling into the tart pan and spread over the crust. Pipe dollops of the meringue with peaks all atop the filling in circles. Bake until the meringue peaks turn light brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

S"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Place the squash, cut sides down, in a glass baking dish. Place the baking dish into the oven and pour enough water into the baking sheet to fill halfway up the sides (this will help steam the squash so it doesn\\'t dry out, making the flesh easier to mash). Place the foil-wrapped garlic directly on an oven rack. Roast the garlic and squash until very tender, about 1 hour. Cool slightly.Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a heavy, small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the leeks and apple and saute until crisp tender, about 6 minutes. Season with salt, to taste.Scoop the cooled acorn squash flesh into a large bowl. Using a potato masher, mash the flesh until smooth. Unwrap the garlic and squeeze the roasted garlic flesh into the squash puree. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter and mash. Stir in the thyme and season with salt, to taste.

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Wrap the beet tightly in foil. Roast the beet directly on the oven rack for 40 minutes, or until just tender when pierced with a knife. Unwrap, cool to room temperature, and then refrigerate until completely chilled. (The beet can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.)For the chile oil: In a small saucepan, combine the oil and minced chile, and set over medium-high heat. As soon as the chile begins to sizzle and turns orange in color, turn off the heat. Transfer the chile oil to a small bowl and cool completely. (The chile oil can be made 1 day ahead. Keep covered at room temperature.)Carefully peel the beet. Using a mandolin, set at 1/8-inch thickness, or a very sharp knife, cut the beet into paper-thin rounds. Arrange the beet slices overlapping on a large platter. Sprinkle the vinegar all over. Drizzle some of the chile oil (with the minced chile) all over the beets. Season the beet slices generously with salt and pepper. Sprinkle all over with the Gorgonzola cheese. Garnish with the arugula and serve.'

S"For the filling: Melt the butter in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic and zucchini and saute until the onion is soft, about 4 minutes. Add the kale and saute 1 minute. Add the vegetable broth, cover and cook until the kale is wilted, about 6 minutes. Uncover and simmer until almost all of the liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and cool slightly. Season with some salt and pepper. Stir in the cheese until melted.For the masa: Mix the masa and baking powder in large bowl. Add the vegetable shortening and mix using an electric mixer until it is the consistency of coarse meal. Pour in the vegetable broth and mix until the dough comes together (the dough should be moist). Mix in the salt and pepper by hand.To assemble the tamales: Place a corn husk, ridged-side down, flat on a work surface and spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of masa onto the corn husk. Then place a spoonful of the kale filling atop the masa. Fold the bigger sides in, and then the pointy tip up over the tamale. Repeat with the remaining corn husks, filling and masa.To steam, place a coin in the bottom of a pot and fill with 1 to 2 inches of water. Make sure that the steamer basket is not immersed in the water. Line the bottom of a steamer basket with some additional husks and stack the tamales in the steamer, with the exposed end facing upward. Top with more husks and cover with a moist towel. Bring the water to a boil and cook until the masa no longer sticks to the husks, 30 to 40 minutes.Cook\\'s Note: The coin will rattle during cooking. If it stops rattling, all the water has evaporated and you need to add more."

S'For the Mexican chocolate ganache: Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring the cream just to a boil in a small pan. Pour immediately over the chocolate and let sit for a minute or 2. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the ganache is completely smooth. Set aside to cool.For the ice cream sandwiches: Break the graham crackers in half. Put the candied walnuts on a small plate. Turn the pint of ice cream on its side and use a serrated knife to slice through the carton, creating 6 ice cream discs. Spread some of the Mexican chocolate ganache on each graham cracker half. Add an ice cream disc (remove the carton) to 6 of the graham cracker halves and top with the remaining graham crackers. Roll the edges in the candied walnuts. Serve immediately.'

S'For the croquettes: Put the potatoes in a heavy medium pot and cover with cold water. Stir in the salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until very tender, about 30 minutes.While the potatoes simmer, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the achiote paste or smoked paprika, if using, mix well until combined, and remove from the heat. Set aside.Drain the potatoes, cool until able to handle, and peel. Mash them in a large bowl with a fork or potato masher. Add the mozzarella cheese and onion mixture and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide the mixture into 8 balls and flatten them into 3-inch patties.Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-heat until hot. Fry the croquettes in 2 batches, turning over once, until a crust forms. Drain on paper towels. Carefully transfer the croquettes to a platter. Top with the arugula and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Squeeze lime juice on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper.'

S'Make the salsa: Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the chiles, tomato, 2 cups water and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium; simmer until the chiles are soft and tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.Remove the bay leaf, then transfer the vegetables and about 1 cup cooking liquid to a blender and puree until smooth, adding more cooking liquid if necessary. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve back into the pan; cook until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Set aside.Make the tacos: Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy saute pan (do not use a nonstick pan) over medium-high heat. Add the potato and saute until golden, 8 to 10 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Add the pork to the pan, season with pepper and sear until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add the broth and bring to a simmer. Add 1 cup of the prepared salsa and return the potato to the pan; cover and simmer until the pork is fork-tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Serve in tortillas; top with more salsa, cilantro, onion and radishes.Photograph by Dave Lauridsen'

S"Mix the flour, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Gradually add in the beer while whisking. Set aside and let the batter rest for 15 minutes before using.For Cream Sauce:Add the mayonnaise and crema to a medium bowl. Whisk in the lemon zest, lemon juice and water. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper (can be made 3 days ahead, covered and refrigerated).For the Fish:In a large skillet, over medium heat, add enough oil to reach a depth of 1-inch. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F or when the end of a wooden spoon sizzles when inserted into the oil.On a large plate, combine the flour and salt. Season the fish pieces all over with salt and pepper and coat with the flour. Working in batches, dip the fillets in the beer batter and coat on both sides. Fry in the hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.Make tacos with the tortillas and fish and top each with cream, shredded cabbage, tomatillo salsa and pickled jalapenos, if desired.*Cook\\'s Note: Crack open a cold Mexican cerveza like a Negra Modelo or a 2 Equis (XX) Amber to make this tasty beer batter, which will change the way you think about fried fish! You can use it for vegetables, too.**Cook\\'s Note: Mexican Crema is Mexico\\'s version of creme fraiche and is found at many supermarkets and can easily be substituted with sour cream."

S'For the guajillo chicken filling: Put the chicken, 3 cloves of the garlic, the halved onion and the bay leaves in a large heavy saucepot and add enough water  to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes, then skim and cover the pot. Continue to simmer until the chicken is fully cooked, 30 more minutes. Set aside until the chicken is cool enough to handle.Add the chiles, remaining 4 cloves garlic and the quartered onion to a pot with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Transfer the ingredients to a blender. Add the cumin and cloves and process until smooth.Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large heavy saucepot. Transfer the chile mixture to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and simmer for 15 minutes.Shred the chicken, discarding the bones and excess fat. (Reserve the cooking liquid for another use.) Transfer the shredded chicken into the simmering salsa. Cook until reduced by two-thirds and the flavors are incorporated, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.When blending hot liquids, first let cool for 5 minutes or so, then transfer to a blender, filling only halfway. Put the lid on, leaving one corner open; this will prevent the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters and pulse until smooth.'

S'Cook the chiles in a dry saute pan over high heat turning constantly until slightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and when cool enough to handle, cut them in half and remove the seeds. Tear them into small pieces and add them to a blender.Add the orange juice, tequila, garlic and olive oil to the blender. Puree the salsa and add it to the same saute pan used to toast the chiles. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Season the salsa with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cool completely. Transfer to a serving bowl and top with crumbled anejo cheese.Cook\\\'s Notes: "Drunken" salsas have been around forever but they were originally prepared with pulque, an alcoholic beverage made from the once sacred maguey (Agave plant). Pulque, which is not easy to find outside of Mexico, is not distilled and has a much stronger flavor than tequila, which I use in its place in this recipe. The alcohol leaves a musky flavor in the cooking process.*The ancho chile is a dried poblano chile. It is also sold as "pasilla" or "chile negro" in the US. It has a deep red color, and the flavor ranges from mild to pungent. The rich, slightly fruit flavored ancho is the sweetest of the dried chiles. Anchos are often sold whole and can be stemmed, seeded then ground at home in a coffee or spice grinder. They can also be found at some supermarkets, Latin specialty markets or online.**Anejo is a salty, crumbly cheese that is generally sprinkled on top of enchiladas, burritos and tacos. It is sold in some supermarkets and Latin specialty markets or even online. It can be substituted with feta cheese.'

S'*Cook\\\'s Note: The poblano chile is a fresh chile that ranges from mild to hot. It is a deep, dark green color and is large and wide with shiny skin. Ripened on the plant and dried it is known as "chile ancho" or "pasilla." They can also be found at most supermarkets or Latin specialty markets. Just keep your eye out, as some stores sell them fresh under the name "pasilla."A great filling for tacos or topping for grilled arrachera. You can use virtually any chile but a mild poblano adds the perfect amount of spice to any dish.'

S'Season the cutlets with salt and pepper, to taste. Put the flour in a dinner plate and season with salt and pepper.  Put the bread crumbs in a second plate and the beaten eggs in a shallow bowl. Dip the cutlets into the flour, then the eggs and finally into the bread crumbs, pressing down on both sides so that the bread crumbs adhere to the meat.Heat 1/2-inch oil in a large skillet to 350 degrees F. Pan-fry the cutlets in batches until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes per side depending on the thickness. Set aside to drain on paper towels.To assemble the sandwiches, halve the rolls horizontally.  Pull out the soft center of the slices and discard.  Spread each roll evenly with the chipotle mayonnaise.

Dip the cutlets into the flour, then the eggs and finally into the breadcrumbs, pressing down on both sides so that the breadcrumbs adhere to the meat.Heat enough oil in a large skillet to come 1/3-inch up the sides of pan until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Working in two batches, pan-fry the cutlets until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to some paper towels to drain.To assemble the sandwiches, halve the rolls horizontally. Pull out the soft center of the bread slices and discard.

S'Place the flour, sugar, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons water, milk, butter, eggs and salt in a blender and process until smooth, about 5 seconds. Turn off the motor. With a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the blender, and blend the batter for 20 seconds longer. Transfer the batter to a bowl and let it stand, covered, for 1 hour. The batter may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.Meanwhile, blend the cajeta, whipping cream and cream cheese in a clean blender until smooth. Set aside.Heat a crepe pan or nonstick skillet measuring 6 to 7 inches across the bottom over moderate heat until it is hot. Brush the pan lightly with butter and heat until the pan is hot but not smoking. Stir the batter and pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan quickly to cover the bottom with a layer of batter. Loosen the edge of the crepe with a spatula, and cook the crepe until the top appears almost dry, about 1 minute. Flip the crepe, cook the other side lightly and transfer the crepe to a plate. Make crepes with all the remaining batter, brushing the pan lightly with butter as necessary.To assemble: On a 10-inch cake stand, or in a 9-inch glass pie dish, pour 1/4 cup cajeta cream into the center. Top with one crepe, more cajeta cream, sliced bananas and pecans. Repeat with remaining crepes, cream, bananas and pecans, finishing the last layer with bananas and pecans. Refrigerate until set, about 45 minutes. Serve cold.'

Add the olives, raisins, carrots and onions and saute for just a couple minutes until softened. Add the tomato puree and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn the heat off and cool to room temperature before filling the empanadas.Grease a large baking sheet with some nonstick cooking spray. Unfold one sheet of puff pastry onto a lightly floured surface. Using a floured rolling pin, roll the pastry out to a 1/4-to-1/8-inch thickness. With a knife, cut out 4 equal squares measuring 4 1/2-by-5 1/2 inches. Add 2 tablespoons of the cooled beef mixture to the center of the square. Brush the edge of each square with some egg wash and fold to shape into triangles. Crimp the edges with a fork. Transfer the empanadas to the prepared baking sheet and brush them with the remaining egg wash. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.'

Let the batter stand for 30 minutes to allow any bubbles to settle.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.For the sauce: Melt  2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions  and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the poblano chiles and cook for 1 minute to blend flavors. Add the heavy cream and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until reduced and the cream coats back of spoon, about 6 minutes. Cool mixture slightly then transfer to blender and process until smooth. Season the poblano sauce with salt and pepper, to taste. Return the sauce to the same skillet and keep warm over low heat until ready to serve.Heat a 10-inch-diameter non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Brush  the pan with oil (or spray with non-stick cooking spray). Add  scant 1/4 cupful batter to the skillet; tilt to coat the bottom of the pan with an even layer of batter.

S'For the pulled pork: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and slightly softened, about 2 more minutes. Add the achiote paste and mix well to incorporate. Add the orange and pineapple juices and bring to a boil. Once it boils, turn the heat off and carefully transfer to a blender. Cool. Process the mixture until smooth, about 2 minutes. Set aside.Sprinkle the pork butt heavily with salt and pepper on all sides. Arrange the orange skins on the bottom of a slow cooker, skin-side up (this adds more flavor to the pork and ensures the meat will not dry out). Place the pork butt on top of the oranges. Pour the achiote puree inside the slow cooker. Cover the slow cooker and turn on to high heat. Let it cook until the pork is tender and ready to shred, about 5 hours.Turn the slow cooker off and remove the oranges from the pot and discard. Let the pork cool slightly before shredding. Using two forks or with clean hands, shred the pork. Return the shredded meat to the slow cooker filled with sauce and keep warm until ready to serve.For the pickled habaneros: Mix the habanero chiles, lime juice, olive oil, oregano and salt into a small bowl. Mix well to incorporate. Let stand at least 20 minutes. They can be made 1 day ahead.For the pickled red onions: Mix together the red onions, lime juice, olive oil, regano and salt into a medium bowl. Mix well to incorporate. Let stand for 30 minutes. They can be made 1 day ahead.For the fried black bean filled tortillas (panuchos): Using a 5-inch round cookie cutter, cut a smaller tortilla out of each tortilla. Save the scraps for making chilaquiles, tortilla soup, etc. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Then add the beans to warm and soften, about 5 minutes, stirring continuously to avoid burning. Turn the heat off and reserve.In a large saute pan, heat the remaining 1/2 cup of vegetable oil to 350 degrees F. While the oil is heating, form the panuchos. Start by spreading 1 tablespoon of warmed beans on the surface of the tortilla. Stack the second tortilla over it pressing on the edges to seal. Remove the excess beans on the side of the panucho. Working in batches, fry the panuchos until golden in color, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and drain on a paper-towel-lined plate.To serve: Top each panucho with about 1/3 cup of cochinita pibil. Top with the pickled red onions and habaneros, if desired. Take a bite, die and go to heaven.'

S"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Using an electric mixer, whip the cream cheese and sour cream in a small bowl until fluffy. Add the granulated sugar and whip until well combined, making sure there are no lumps. Reserve for later use.Beat the egg and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl with a fork.Unfold 1 pastry sheet on a lightly floured flat surface. Roll the pastry into a 14-by-12-inch rectangle. Spoon half of the cream cheese mixture lengthwise down the center of the pastry. Cut slits 1 inch apart from the 2 sides of the pastry rectangle within 1/2 inch of the cream cheese mixture. Arrange half of the strawberries down the center of the pastry on top of the cream cheese mixture. Starting at one end, fold the pastry strips over the strawberries on a diagonal, alternating sides, to cover the strawberries. Repeat the entire process with the remaining pastry sheet, cream cheese filling and strawberries. Brush the pastries very lightly with the egg wash (otherwise they won\\'t rise). Sprinkle with the demerara sugar and top with pistachios.Bake until golden brown, 30 minutes. Let cool on a rack for about 20 minutes before serving."

Discard the cinnamon stick. Add the butter, sugar and salt and stir until the sugar dissolves and the butter melts. Turn off the heat. Using a wooden spoon, quickly stir in the flour until it is well combined and a shiny dough forms. Return the pan to medium-heat and cook the dough, stirring, until it starts to pull away from the sides of pan, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to a medium bowl and let cool, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, stirring vigorously after each addition, until the egg is completely incorporated (the dough will be sticky.)Transfer the dough to a pastry bag and pipe 1-inch pieces, cutting the dough with scissors every inch, into the hot oil. Fry the churro bites, 6 at a time, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels. Return the oil to 350 degrees F between batches.For the cinnamon sugar: Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl.For the Mexican chocolate sauce: Bring the heavy cream to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off the heat and add the chopped chocolate, stirring until completely dissolved. Serve warm as a dipping sauce for the churro bites.Roll the warm churro bites in the cinnamon-sugar. Serve Mexican chocolate sauce alongside for dipping churro bites.'

S'*Cook\\\'s Note: The ancho chile is a dried poblano chile. It is also sold as "pasilla" in the US. It is a deep red color, and the flavor ranges from mild to pungent. The rich, slightly fruit flavored ancho is the sweetest of the dried chiles. Anchos are often sold whole and can be stemmed, seeded then ground at home in a coffee or spice grinder. They can also be found at most supermarkets, latin specialty markets or online.Cook\\\'s Note: Heat 1/2 cup beef broth (stock) with a little mint jelly and simmer several minutes, for an easy and tasty sauce to go with your lamb.'

Roughly chop the remaining 1 cup walnuts.Position two oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F.Beat the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the flour, then the ground and chopped walnuts. Divide the dough in half, forming each half into a ball. Wrap separately in plastic and chill until cold, about 30 minutes.Put the confectioners\\' sugar in a large bowl.Working with half of the chilled dough at a time and keeping the rest in the fridge, roll the dough by 2 teaspoonfuls between your palms into balls. Arrange the balls on a large baking sheet, spacing them 1/2 inch apart.Bake the cookies until golden brown on the bottom and just pale golden on top, about 18 minutes. Cool the cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Toss the warm cookies in the powdered sugar. Transfer the sugar-coated cookies to a rack to cool completely. The cookies can be prepared up to 2 days ahead. Once cooled, store them in an airtight container. You need to make sure they are cooled before storing them, otherwise they will get soggy. Sift additional powdered sugar and cinnamon over the cookies if desired before serving."

Transfer steak to the marinade and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes or in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours.Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium-high heat and brush with olive oil. Cook the steak, turning occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest on a plate covered with aluminum foil for 10 minutes. Cut the meat against the grain into 1/2-inch pieces.On the same griddle used to cook the steak, over medium-high heat, place 3 (1/4 cup) mounds of cheese spaced 2 inches apart. Let cook for 3 minutes (the cheese will spread flat like a tortilla, make sure they don\\'t stick together). After the cheese browns on the bottom (the cheese will stay white on the top side), add 1/4 cup sliced meat over half of the cheese and fold the other half over like a half moon-shaped quesadilla. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Repeat the procedure with the remaining ingredients.Serve each cheese taco with sliced avocado and salsa or hot sauce."

S'Remove the leaves from half of each rosemary sprig. Reserve the sprigs to use for skewers. Chop enough of the leaves to make 1 1/2 teaspoons. (Reserve the remaining leaves for another use.)  Combine the olive oil, lime juice, garlic, cilantro, chili powder, and chopped rosemary in a medium bowl.  Season the marinade with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the shrimp and toss until coated. Let stand for 5 minutes. Skewer 2 shrimp onto each rosemary sprig.Heat a large, wide grill pan (or comal) over high heat. Add the skewers and cook for 1 minute per side, or just until the shrimp is cooked through and turns pink. Do not overcook. Transfer to a platter, garnish with the lime wedges and serve immediately.*Cook\\\'s Note: Make sure to buy rosemary sprigs with thick stems. Some rosemary twigs are very flimsy; you want the kind that are like a small twig, which will be strong enough to hold the shrimp.**Cook\\\'s Note: Use the exact same marinade on chicken breasts and whole chickens for roasting. It\\\'s also great on any white fish fillet; just add a couple of tablespoons of butter to the pan drippings after the fish has been cooked and removed. Drizzle the sauce over the fish and serve!***Cook\\\'s Note: The chipotle chile is a smoked, dried jalapeno. They can be found dried, pickled or canned "in adobo" which is a sauce made with ground chiles, herbs, vinegar and spices. For this recipe, we will use the chipotle powder. Both types are sold in most supermarkets.'

S'Put an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease a Bundt pan with butter.First prepare the cake batter. Add the butter and sugar to a bowl and, using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer, beat until light and fluffy. Then beat in 1 egg.Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Mix the buttermilk, cocoa powder, tequila, triple sec and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Beat half of the flour mixture half of the buttermilk into the egg mixture. Repeat, ending with the flour mixture. Blend until well incorporated.Now prepare the flan mixture. In a blender, combine the condensed milk, evaporated milk, cream cheese, the remaining 3 eggs and vanilla extract. Blend on high for 30 seconds.Scoop the cake batter into the prepared Bundt pan. Then slowly pour the flan mixture over the cake batter. Add about 1-inch of hot water to the roasting pan.Carefully slide the pan into the oven and bake until the surface of the cake is firm to the touch, or an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 1 hour. When the cake is done, remove from the water bath and cool completely to room temperature, about 1 hour.Run the tip of a sharp paring knife along the edge of the Bundt pan to loosen. Invert a large, rimmed serving platter over the Bundt pan, grasp tightly together, jiggle it a little and flip over to release the chocoflan from the pan. Garnish the cake with some chopped pecans. Place some mixed berries in the center of the chocoflan then sprinkle the entire thing with powdered sugar and serve.'

Drain the potatoes and let cool slightly.Meanwhile, prepare a grill to medium-high heat. Add the corn and grill, turning onto all sides, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.Halve the potatoes and put them in a large bowl. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the corn kernels off of the cobs and add to the bowl. Add the poblano chiles, scallions, sour cream, mayonnaise and cilantro and mix gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper and serve. (The potato salad can be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.)Cook\\'s Note: To char the chiles (or any fresh chile): Put the chiles over a gas flame or underneath the broiler and cook until they are blackened on all sides. Enclose them in a plastic bag and let stand for 10 minutes to steam, which will make them easier to peel."

Turn off the heat and add the baking soda and salt, stirring rapidly. Immediately pour the caramel over the popcorn, tossing to coat. Cool until the mixture is cool enough for handling, about 5 minutes. Using a bowl of water to dampen hands, shape the popcorn into balls about 3 1/2 inches in diameter.

S'In a large mixing bowl, mix together the ground lamb, mint, salt, pepper and egg. Using clean hands, mix until well combined. Measure 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture and roll in the palm of your hands to form a meatball. Place the formed meatballs on a parchment-lined baking sheet. You should have enough to make 16 to 18 meatballs.In a heavy saucepan, heat the vegetable oil on medium-high heat. Add the onions and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until the onions are softened and the tomato paste is cooked into the onions, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, corn and carrots. Saute until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and then add the lamb meatballs (albondigas) and the bay leaf. Score the serrano chile by finely slicing it down the middle, being careful not to fully cut it in half, and add to the pot. Lower the heat and cover. Simmer for 35 minutes.Using a large spoon, skim the grease off the top of the soup and discard. Season the soup with salt and pepper.'

S"Mix the strawberries and 3 tablespoons of the sugar in a small bowl. Let the strawberries macerate at room temperature for 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange 6 individual tartlet pans with removable bottoms on a baking sheet. Spray the tartlet pans with nonstick cooking spray. Blend the Maria crackers and the piloncillo in a processor until coarse crumbs form. Add the butter and process until the crumbs come together. Press the crumbs into the prepared tartlet pans. Bake until the tartlet shells are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool completely.Using an electric mixer, whip the cream cheese and the sour cream in a small bowl, until fluffy. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and whip until well combined. Add the whipping powdered topping and whip until very fluffy. Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the macerating liquid from the strawberries. Fold the strawberries and the reserved 2 tablespoons of liquid into the cream mixture. Spoon the filling over the tartlets, dividing equally. Tarts can be prepared 1 day ahead, covered and refrigerated.*Cook\\'s Note: Maria Crackers (Galletas Marias) are a round sweet biscuit with vanilla flavor. They are the Mexican version of the English Marie biscuit and can be used in layered deserts as you would with lady fingers.  They can easily be substituted with graham crackers.**Cook\\'s Note: Piloncillo is often used in Mexican cuisine to sweeten drinks or deserts. It is unrefined cane sugar, usually found in the shape of small cones and can be substituted with brown sugar."

Add the hot broth and continue beating until the dough is soft and fluffy (it should pull away from the side of the bowl easily). Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let sit about 10 minutes.Place the corn husks in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until softened, about 8 minutes. Drain.Make the filling: Roast the poblanos over the flame of a gas burner, turning, until charred, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let cool. Peel the poblanos with your fingers and discard the stems and seeds, then coarsely chop. Melt the butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, corn and poblanos and cook 2 more minutes. Add the crema; when it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and stir in the cheese until melted. Season with salt and set aside to cool.Tear 4 corn husks into 1/2-inch-thick strips to use as ties; set aside. Assemble the tamales: Hold an open corn husk in one hand; spread about 2 tablespoons dough on the husk, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border on all sides. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling down the center, then fold in the long sides of the husk to cover the filling and fold up the narrow short end (leave the wide end open). Tie a strip of corn husk around the tamale to hold the folded flaps in place. Repeat to make 12 tamales.Place the tamales, open-side up, in a steamer basket set in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the bottom of the pot by several inches, but not enough to touch the tamales. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low; cover the pot with a kitchen towel and a lid and steam until firm, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, adding more water to the pot if needed. The tamales should pull away from the husks without sticking; if they\\'re still sticky, continue cooking. Let stand at least 10 minutes before serving.Photograph by Dave Lauridsen"

S'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.In a small saucepan, add the butter and melt over medium-low heat. Stir in the honey, and cook until the mixture bubbles, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, and stir in the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, pecans, ground ancho and garlic powder. Season the marinade, to taste, with salt and pepper.** Arrange the drumettes on a baking sheet, and brush each with the marinade. Bake until the chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Baste once, halfway through baking time. Transfer to a serving platter and serve hot.*Cook\\\'s Note: The ancho chile is a dried poblano chile. It is also sold as "pasilla" in the US. It is a deep red color, and the flavor ranges from mild to pungent. The rich, slightly fruit flavored ancho is the sweetest of the dried chiles. Anchos are often sold whole and can be stemmed, seeded then ground at home in a coffee or spice grinder. They can also be found at most supermarkets, Latin specialty markets or online.**Cook\\\'s Note: Cover your baking sheet with tin foil for easy clean up and to prevent marinade from burning in the oven.'

S'Make the pickled onion: Combine the red onion, lime juice, olive oil, oregano and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Let stand 30 minutes or up to 1 day; drain.Meanwhile, make the sauce: Fill a medium pot with water and add the tomatoes, onion and garlic. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat; let cool. Drain the ingredients, then transfer to a blender and puree until smooth; season with salt. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan; add the tomato mixture and cook until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Set aside.Prepare the jalapenos: Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Fry the jalapenos until blistered, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, then place in a bowl and tightly cover with plastic wrap. Let steam about 15 minutes, then peel off the blistered skins using a paring knife or rub with a kitchen towel. Using a sharp small knife, cut a T in each jalapeno, starting at the top of the pepper and running almost to the bottom. Using a very small spoon or the tip of the knife, carefully remove the seeds and veins. Set the peppers aside.Make the filling: Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a medium skillet. Add the potato and cook, stirring, until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon. Add the carrot, onion and garlic to the skillet; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 5 minutes. Add the beef and cook, breaking up the meat, until it starts browning, about 5 minutes. Add the raisins and potato. Cook, stirring, until the meat is cooked through, about 10 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Reheat the sauce, adding up to 1/2 cup water if it is too thick. Divide the beef mixture among the jalapenos. Top with the tomato sauce and pickled red onion.Photograph by Dave Lauridsen'

S"To char the chiles: Over a gas flame, char the chiles on all sides until blackened, placing them into a sealable plastic bag to sweat for about 10 minutes. Remove the chiles from the bag and, using paper towels, wipe off the charred skin from the chiles. With a paring knife, slice the chiles down the center just to reveal the inside, being careful not to fully cut them in half. With a spoon, scoop out the seeds and the vein, keeping the stem and the rest of the chile intact. Place the chiles in a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish and set aside for stuffing.To make the tuna filling: Combine the tuna, peas, corn and mayonnaise in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.To make the pickling liquid: Cook the carrots in boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and onions and cook until the onions are slightly cooked, but still crispy, 5 minutes. Add 2/3 cup water and the vinegar and bring to a simmer (see Cook\\'s Note, below). Add the carrots, oregano and bay leaves. Simmer until the vegetables are crisp- tender and almost all of the vinegar has evaporated, 8 minutes. Let cool slightly.To stuff the peppers: Stuff the peppers with the tuna mixture. Place back in the baking dish; they should fit snuggly. Pour the warm pickled mixture over the stuffed chiles and allow to cool to room temperature. Cover and chill for 2 hours or overnight. Serve cold.Cook\\'s Note: For safety, before adding the water and vinegar to the hot oil, sprinkle just a few drops of the liquid into the oil. If the oil splatters, then it needs to cool before adding the full recipe amount. Continue to test the oil with mere sprinkles of vinegar and water until no splattering occurs. At this time, it will be safe to add the full amount of vinegar and water."

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a large heavy saute pan, add enough oil to come 2 inches up the sides of the pan. Heat the oil on medium-high heat. When hot, work in batches and quickly fry the tortillas for about 10 seconds on each side (they should still be pliable). Remove the tortillas from the heat and drain on a paper-towel-lined plate.In a medium saute pan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and add the garlic and onion. Saute until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the tomato puree. Cook for 10 minutes and turn the heat off.In a separate large saute pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the zucchini and corn. Cook for 2 minutes, and then add the chopped poblano chiles. Add 1/2 cup water to the mixture and cook for 4 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with a nonstick cooking spray. Cover the bottom with about 4 tortillas. Add 1/2 cup of the tomato mixture on top of the tortillas. Top with 1 1/2 cups of the zucchini mixture. Add 1 cup of the cheese. Drizzle with 1/4 cup of Mexican crema. Sprinkle the first layer with some salt and pepper. Start on the second layer with the tortillas, then the tomato, zucchini, cheese and Mexican crema. Again sprinkle with some salt and pepper. Repeat for a third time, to finish off a third layer. Place the casserole into the oven until the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot.'

S'On a plate, mix the sugar and cinnamon. In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, add enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the pan. Heat over medium-high heat until a deep frying thermometer, inserted in the oil, reaches 350 degrees F. (If you do not have a thermometer, test the oil with a piece of tortilla, which should sizzle when it touches the oil and should brown in about 2 to 3 minutes.) One by one, fry tortillas until golden brown. With a slotted spoon, transfer the crisps to paper towels to drain. While still warm, transfer to cinnamon-sugar mixture, turn to coat and serve.*Cooks note: These crisps can be made ahead, sealed in cellophane bags and given as gifts!**Cooks note: A fun way to present these crisps is to serve a couple in a bowl of vanilla bean ice cream with fresh, seasonal berries on top.'

S'Special equipment: 4 individual casserole dishesTo make the salsa:Preheat the broiler or oven to 550 degrees F.Remove husks from the tomatillos and rinse under warm water to remove the stickiness. Put the chiles, garlic, onion and tomatillos on a baking sheet. Season with a little olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Put on a rack about 1 or 2 inches from the heat, and cook, turning the vegetables once, until softened and slightly charred, about 5 to 7 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel the garlic and pull off the tops of the chiles. Add all the broiled ingredients to a blender along with the fresh cilantro and puree. Pour in 1/4 cup of chicken broth and blend to combine. Add more broth, if needed, for desired consistency.To make the chilaquiles:Pour about 1/3 cup vegetable oil into a large saute pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the tortillas, working in 2 or 3 batches, and cook until lightly browned and nearly crisp. Drain the tortillas on paper towels and discard the remaining oil. Wipe the pan with a paper towel.In the same pan, add the tomatillo salsa and bring to simmer over low heat. Add the tortillas and cook until soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide the mixture among 4 individual casserole dishes. Top with the cheese crumbles and onion rings. Drizzle with Mexican crema, sprinkle with some chopped fresh cilantro and serve immediately.*Cook\\\'s Note: Salsa Verde means "green sauce" and is typically made with tomatillos, green chiles and cilantro. Make your own fresh, or you can also find it canned at most supermarkets.Tomatillos are a small green fruit encased in a tissue paper-like husk. They should be used when they are still green, before they are ripe and the husk has turned brown. Before using, remove the husk, rinse and dry the fruit. (They do not need to be seeded.) They are found in most supermarkets**Cook\\\'s Note: Chilaquiles is a Mexican brunch dish invented to use leftovers. It is made with day old tortillas (cut or torn into chips) and salsa verde. They are cooked together until the tortillas are slightly softened. Chilaquiles are eaten alone or with beans, eggs or shredded chicken.***Cook\\\'s Note: Queso fresco is a white, mild, fresh Mexican cheese with the texture of fresh farmer\\\'s cheese in the US. Queso fresco can be found in many supermarkets, Latin specialty markets or online. It can be substituted with a mild feta cheese.'

S'Preheat the broiler or a grill pan over high heat. Broil or grill the poblanos until the skins are charred. Transfer to a covered bowl until cool enough to handle, 10 minutes. Remove the skins and seeds, and then slice into 1/4-inch-wide rings.Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan or a deep fryer until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F.Meanwhile, arrange 3 mixing bowls in an assembly line. Mix together the flour and 1 teaspoon salt in the first. In the second, place the eggs and beat them. Fill the third with the breadcrumbs and ground guajillo and mix together.Carefully drench the poblano rings in the flour, making sure not to break them. Shake off any excess flour and then soak in the egg wash. Then cover with the panko mixture. Fry until crisp and golden in color, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel to remove excess oil, and then season heavily with salt.'
