S'Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Trim off the top 1/2-inch of the garlic bulb with a sharp knife to expose some of the clove ends. Drizzle with olive oil, wrap loosely in aluminum foil, and place on a small baking sheet. Roast until the bulb is soft and fragrant, 45 to 55 minutes. Squeeze the cloves from the skins and set aside in a small bowl until ready to use.Place the potatoes in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat and simmer until a fork inserted into a potato releases easily, about 20 minutes.In a small glass bowl, mix the wasabi powder with 1/2 teaspoon of water to start, adding any additional water by drops until a thick paste is created. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to bloom, at least 5 minutes.Drain water from the potatoes and return the potatoes to the pot, allowing excess water to evaporate. In a small saucepan or in the microwave, warm the butter and heavy cream. Add the mixture to the potatoes, along with the wasabi and roasted garlic cloves, and mash until smooth and fluffy. Adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if needed.Serve warm.'

S'Make the sausage: Toast the coriander, fennel and caraway seeds in a small skillet over high heat, stirring, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Cool completely, then grind with a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder. Add the garlic, sage, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper and the red pepper flakes; grind to mix. Combine the spices with the ground pork in a bowl. Add the maple syrup and mix. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.Meanwhile, make the dough: Combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, Italian seasoning, mustard powder, baking soda, cayenne and sea salt in a food processor; pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse 5 to 6 times (for 4 to 5 seconds each time), until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Add the mozzarella and pulse 3 to 4 times, until well combined. Add the buttermilk and process until a ball forms. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.Form the sausage mixture into 16 mini sausages, about 4 inches long (use about 2 tablespoons sausage for each). Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the sausages in 2 batches until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Cool on paper towels.Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Sprinkle with flour, then gently pat out and roll into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle. Trim the edges to make them even. Cut the rectangle in half crosswise, then cut each half into four 3-by-8-inch strips. Cut each strip in half diagonally to form 16 long triangles. Transfer to a baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Place 1 sausage on the wide end of a dough triangle and roll up. Repeat with the remaining dough and sausages. Arrange the pigs in blankets 2 inches apart on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets. Brush the tops with the beaten egg and bake until golden, about 15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the chipotle-agave mustard: Combine the agave, both mustards, the adobo sauce and a pinch of black pepper in a bowl. Serve the pigs in blankets with the mustard.Photograph by Con Poulos'

S'Cut the potatoes in 3/8-inch slices. Then stack cut pieces of potatoes and cut them into 3/8-inch square pieces. Submerge the potatoes in a large bowl of water and let sit for 30 minutes. This will help leach the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing.While potatoes are soaking, prepare the sauce: Combine all ingredients in a nonreactive pan and heat over medium-high. Adjust heat to a simmer and reduce by half.Heat a heavy stock pot with the oil to 325 degrees F over medium heat. (Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature.) Remove potatoes from the water and pat dry. Carefully add 2 handfuls of potatoes to the hot oil. There should be at least 1-inch of oil above the potatoes. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until potatoes are light brown. Remove potatoes, with a slotted spoon, shake off excess oil and place on a rack to cool. Repeat until all of the potatoes are par-cooked.After all the potatoes have been par-cooked, heat oil up to 350 degrees F over medium heat. Add 2 handfuls of par-cooked potatoes, and cook for 2 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oil, with a slotted spoon, shake off excess oil. Transfer potatoes to a serving bowl and season lightly with salt and pepper. Repeat this method until all potatoes are fried.To serve: Drizzle sauce over hot fries and garnish with toasted sesame seeds.'

S'Prepare the brine: In a large soup pot, bring 8 cups water to a boil. Add the kosher salt, peppercorns and garlic; remove from heat. Let cool 30 minutes, then transfer to a large pot or ice chest lined with a large garbage bag. Add another 8 cups water, then add the wings and twist the bag closed. Refrigerate for 4 hours.  Mix all the rub ingredients in a large resealable plastic bag. Drain the wings. Rinse under cool water, pat very dry and put in the bag with the rub. Mix to coat evenly. Seal the bag and refrigerate until ready to cook. (You can do this a day ahead.) Preheat the broiler. Remove the wings from the bag and place in a single layer on a lightly oiled foil-lined pan. Broil for 8 minutes, then turn and cook for an additional 5 to 8 minutes, or until crisp and golden.Meanwhile, combine all the ingredients for the salsa, except the olive oil, in a food processor, using salt to taste. Slowly add the oil and puree until smooth. Serve the wings with the salsa.Photograph by James Baigrie'

S'For the polenta: Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large pot. Add the polenta and whisk until fully incorporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the salt and cook, covered, over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes. Finish by folding in the melted butter. Keep warm while you prepare the chorizo.For the chorizo: Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until almost translucent, and then add the ground pork. Brown 4 to 5 minutes while breaking the pork pieces up with the back of a wooden spoon. Add the paprika, granulated garlic, onion powder, chili powder and cumin, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook 1 minute longer to toast the spices, and then add the vinegar, garlic and tomatoes. Simmer until the sauce is thickened and reduced, 8 to 10 minutes. Taste and season once more with salt and pepper. Keep warm.For assembly: Wash, drain and finely slice the chard. Heat the garlic and some olive oil in a large pan and saute, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Drain in a colander and squeeze out any excess moisture.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease an 8-by-8-by-2-inch gratin dish or an oval 9-inch cast-iron pan. Pour half of the polenta in and spread out evenly. Top with half of the chorizo and all of the Swiss chard. Sprinkle with half of each cheese. Repeat with a layer of the remaining polenta, then the remaining chorizo, and finally the remaining cheese. Cover with foil, place the dish on a sheet tray and bake 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the cheese is golden and bubbly, 15 minutes longer. Let sit 25 minutes to set up, then cut into portions and serve.'

Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Top with another sheet of foil and crimp to seal the edges. Poke holes in the top to allow steam to escape. Place in the oven and roast until the beets are tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven. Allow to cool in the foil pouch before loosening the skins and discarding. Quarter the peeled beets and place in a large bowl.For the cherry vinaigrette: Drain the cherries and roughly chop. Whisk together the vinegars (including the red wine vinegar from the cherries) and cherries while slowly drizzling in the olive oil so it lightly emulsifies. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside until ready to use.For the salad: Toss the warm beets with the cherry vinaigrette. Add the kale, pepitas, goat cheese and mint, continuing to toss. Season with salt and pepper.'

S'Place the roast onto a cutting board with the short side toward you and fat facing down. Using a sharp filet knife (with the blade horizontal to the board), butterfly the roast open about 1 inch from the bottom of the roast. Work carefully to not cut all the way through. Continue to slice horizontally, opening the roast up until you have a large, thin, flat piece of meat. Place the pork in large airtight freezer bag (or large plastic container with a lid).To prepare the brine, bring 6 cups water, the salt, sugar, peppercorns, garlic, thyme, bay leaves and onions to a simmer in a medium pot over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and salt have completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and cool by adding the ice cubes. Pour the brine into the freezer bag, submerging the roast completely, seal and set aside for 25 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Remove the pork from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Lay the sausages inside lengthwise. Pierce the casings with the tip of a sharp paring knife (this will ensure the flavor of the sausage goes into the pork as it cooks). Starting with the short side, roll up the roast tightly, jelly roll style. Secure the roast with tightly fitted kitchen twine at even intervals about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, the granulated garlic and paprika.Heat the oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium heat. Add the roast and sear fat-side down first, 3 to 4 minutes, and then on each of the three other sides. When turned to the final side, transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the internal temperature hits 145 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove the roast from the oven; rest the pork on a platter while you make gravy from the pan drippings.Set the pan over medium-low heat. Add a little oil, if needed, and saute the onions, carrots and celery. Cook the vegetables until well caramelized, about 8 minutes. Then season with salt and pepper. Deglaze the pan with the vermouth and reduce until the liquid has almost completely reduced. Add the chicken stock and reduce again for another 5 minutes; this will ensure you have a nice, rich sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper.Remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the butter to thicken the sauce. Finish with the lemon zest, a squeeze of lemon juice and serve the sauce over sliced andouille-stuffed pork loin.'

S'For the mole negro: In a large saute pan over medium heat, toast the ancho and guajillo chiles on both sides until softened and fragrant, being careful not to scorch them, 20 to 30 seconds. Add 1 cup of hot water to the pan, just enough to cover the chiles, and set aside for 30 minutes to reconstitute. Add the chiles and soaking water to a blender. Then add the onions, almonds, raisins, piloncillo, sesame seeds, cinnamon, oregano, garlic, cloves and 1/2 cup of the chicken broth. Puree until very smooth, adding a little more chicken broth if too thick.In a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the lard and the mole puree and cook, stirring constantly, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture becomes glossy, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups chicken broth and the chocolate. Boil for about 5 minutes, then reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until thick, about 15 minutes. Add the salt; taste and adjust as needed. Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm.For the grilled chicken: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a grill for high heat and wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted paper towel.Combine the granulated garlic, salt, ancho powder, cumin, chipotle powder, pepper and cayenne in a small bowl and mix well. Sprinkle the chicken pieces all over with spice mixture. Place the chicken on the grill, skin-side down, and cook until nicely charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the reverse side for another 3 to 4 minutes. Once chicken has acquired nice grill marks, transfer it to a roasting pan and finish cooking in the oven, 15 to 20 minutes.To serve, ladle the mole sauce onto a large platter and arrange the grilled chicken, skin-side up, on the top. Garnish with scallions and cilantro. Serve with extra mole sauce on the side.'

S"Special equipment: butcher\\'s twineIn a mortar and pestle, combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, sage, fennel seeds, thyme, rosemary, 1 tablespoon black pepper, chile flakes and 2 teaspoons salt. Grind and pound the mixture into a smooth paste.  Place the turkey breast skin side down on a clean flat surface. With a sharp knife, butterfly the turkey by cutting down the long side of the breast so it can open up like a book to create a large, flat rectangle of even thickness. Score the flesh lightly in a cross-hatch pattern, being careful not to cut too deeply into the flesh.  Season the turkey with salt and black pepper. Rub the herb-spice paste into all the cuts on the surface of the turkey breast. Roll the butterflied breast together tightly starting with the side that does not have skin underneath it (that way there is skin on the outer layers when rolling it up). Form the turkey into a cylinder and secure with butchers twine.  Tie the roll every 1 1/2 inches, then place in the refrigerator for 4 hours uncovered; this will help the turkey firm up and allows the salt to do a short dry cure on the meat.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Remove the turchetta from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature, about 30 minutes.  Brush the turchetta with olive oil and season with salt and black pepper.  In a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, brown the turchetta, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Arrange the turchetta skin side up and place the whole pan into the oven and cook until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F (carryover cooking will increase the temperature as the turchetta rests), about 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, place on a large plate, tent with foil and rest 15 to 20 minutes. Add the chicken stock to the reserved juices in the pan and stir to combine. Keep warm.To serve the turchetta, remove the string and use a sharp carving knife to slice it into 1-inch-thick medallions. Shingle the slices on a large serving platter, spoon cooking juice over the turchetta, and serve immediately."

S'In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the bottom blade, add the all-purpose flour, wheat flour and salt and pulse 2 to 3 times to combine. Add in the cold lard and butter and pulse until the mix resembles cornmeal-like texture, 5 to 6 (20-second) pulses. Add the warm water and pulse until a dough ball forms.Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead until the dough is elastic and smooth and no longer sticky, 3 to 4 minutes. Form into a small loaf shape, about 6 by 4-inches. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. Working with one at a time, roll into a ball, about the size of a golf ball and dust lightly with flour. Repeat.Place the balls, one at a time, into a well-floured tortilla press, press down and remove. You should have a 6-inch disc at this point. Place the disc on a floured board and roll out to 8 to 9-inch in diameter and almost paper thin, lightly dusting with flour and turning as needed. You can stack them, separated by waxed paper.Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add the raw tortillas, one at time, cook for 30 to 45 seconds per side, or just until the bubbles puff up, then turn and repeat. Keep the cooked tortillas in a towel, covered, to keep warm and pliable.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the chicken: Using kitchen shears, remove the backbone of the chicken and set aside in the refrigerator for another use (such as Smoked Chicken Minestrone). Cut the chicken in half, straight through the breastbone. By separating the chicken into two pieces it will ensure that the chicken gets smoked more thoroughly. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, the granulated garlic and smoked paprika.Place 1 deep aluminum roasting pan over the stove top. Line with aluminum foil. Add the soaked wood chips to a large piece of foil, and then fold in the sides to make a pouch. Punch holes in the top of the pouch, set it directly over a gas burner and turn on high. Leave for 2 to 3 minutes, watching carefully. Once it begins to smoke, using tongs, transfer the pouch to the bottom of the lined roasting pan. Set a wire rack over the chips in the lined roasting pan and position it so the wood chips are directly over the burner and continue to smoke. Place the chicken pieces bone-side down on the rack. Cover tightly with aluminum foil to seal in the smoke. Put the roasting pan into the oven and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove and cool. Shred the smoked chicken breast and set aside 1 1/2 cups for the cannelloni (reserve the rest for another use). Increase the oven to 375 degrees F.While the chicken is smoking, make the creamy roasted red pepper sauce: Bring the oil to medium heat in a large saucepot. Sweat the onions until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat until fragrant, about a minute. Stir in the peppers and tomatoes. Simmer for 5 minutes. Working in 2 cup batches, process the sauce on high in a blender until smooth. Return the sauce to the pot, reduce the heat to low and whisk in the cream. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. If making ahead, cool before refrigerating for up to a week.For the cannelloni: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, cream cheese, 1 cup of the Parmesan, the egg and nutmeg with a wooden spoon. Fold in the reserved shredded chicken, spinach, tomatoes and some salt and pepper. Spoon the filling into a medium pastry bag fitted with a large open tip. Spread 1/2 cup of the creamy roasted red pepper sauce evenly on the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch gratin dish. Pipe about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the filling into the cannelloni shells and place them into the gratin dish. Spoon the remaining sauce over the cannelloni. Sprinkle with the panko and remaining Parmesan. Cover and bake until the filling is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Bake uncovered until the top is golden and bubbling, an additional 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and cool on a resting rack. Garnish with Parmesan and serve.'

Presoak 12 bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.For the glaze: Combine the butter, pineapple juice, rum, sugar, tomato paste and vinegar in a small saucepan and simmer until reduced and the glaze has a texture like maple syrup, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool slightly so it thickens up even more.For the meatballs: Set a small saute pan over high heat. Coat with a little olive oil and saute the garlic and shallots until caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with some salt and pepper. Set aside to cool.In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and cream and set aside to soak.In a large mixing bowl, combine the beef, pork, cooled shallot and garlic mixture, currants, Parmesan, pine nuts and moistened breadcrumbs. Sprinkle with some salt and pepper and mix well. Form into 36 (about 1 1/2-inch) meatballs and thread 3 meatballs per skewer. Set a wire rack over a baking sheet lined with foil and spray with nonstick spray. Arrange the skewers on the rack and bake in the center of the oven until the meatballs are just barely cooked but will hold their shape on the grill, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven.Heat a grill to high and wipe down with an oil blotted paper towel to clean and create a nonstick surface. Place the skewers on the grill and char for about 30 seconds per side. Once they are browned, brush with the glaze and cook until the glaze is shiny and lightly coats the meatballs, 30 to 40 seconds more. Serve with any remaining glaze on the side for dipping.'

S"1. Combine all the rub spices in a bowl and rub the pork butt with 1/4 cup of the spice mixture.Wrap the pork butt in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours or overnight.2. Unwrap the pork butt and smoke for about 1 hour. (Follow the stovetop smoker manufacturer\\'s instructions or use an outdoor smoker.)3. Preheat the oven to 225degreesF. Remove the pork butt from the smoker, place it in a roasting pan, and add the beer. Cover and braise in the oven until the pork is tender and pulls apart with a fork, about 3 hours.4.  Pull the pork and mix it with 1/2 cup of the braising liquid and BBQ sauce to taste.As this makes more pulled pork than you need, go ahead and freeze any leftovers for future pancakes; it freezes beautifully. And you\\'ll have more spice rub than you\\'ll need, so you can store it in a covered jar in the refrigerator for future BBQ."

S'Debeard and clean the exterior of the mussel shells very well (they will be used later for service).In a cast-iron Dutch oven over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the garlic, red pepper flakes, white wine and thyme. Bring the wine to a simmer and add the mussels. Cover tightly and cook until all the mussels have opened, 6 to 8 minutes.Remove the mussels from the pot, discarding any that did not open, and when cool enough to handle, remove the flesh and chop. Rinse the shells and put aside for service. Strain the liquid from the pot and reserve. Wipe the Dutch oven clean with a paper towel.Place the pot over medium-high heat, add the remaining olive oil and, when shimmering, add the onions and bell peppers and saute until the onions are just starting to caramelize, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the serrano, the remaining garlic and the tomatoes and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.Add the butter and the flour. Once the butter melts, slowly incorporate the milk. Add the reserved cooking liquid from the mussels, a little at a time, until the mixture is creamy but not runny. Add the chopped mussels and gradually add 1 cup panko, as needed, and stir gently to combine.Preheat the oven to broil and adjust the rack to 6 inches below the element.Separate, rinse and dry the mussel shells.Spread the rock salt evenly in an ovenproof serving platter. Fill the mussel shells with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the mussel-vegetable mixture. Place the remaining cup of panko in a shallow bowl or plate and spread out. Gently roll the filled shells in the panko. Nest the filled mussels into the rock salt on the prepared platter. Season with nutmeg, salt and pepper, place under the broiler and broil until golden brown and bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes, watching carefully to avoid burning.Sprinkle with the chopped Italian parsley, squeeze a few lemon wedges over the mussels and garnish with remaining lemon wedges and serve immediately.'

Wrap the bacon around the shrimp, and skewer with bamboo through the point where the bacon ends meet (to keep from unraveling). Skewer 3 to 5 shrimp per bamboo. Combine the BBQ sauce, oil, chipotle, lemon juice, mustard, chile flakes, black pepper and cayenne in a blender and puree. Separate the sauce in half, one for basting and one for dipping. Cook the bacon-wrapped shrimp on a grill over medium heat. When the shrimp begin to turn pink, begin basting with the chipotle sauce.Serve with the remaining sauce on the side for dipping.'

S"Special equipment: a charcoal kettle-style grill; charcoal; 8 cups large smoking wood chips (applewood and hickory mix), soaked in water; butcher\\'s twineFor the prime rib: Heat the charcoal until hot, then carefully arrange on one side of a kettle-style grill, and place the soaked wood chips over the hot coals. Place an aluminum pan filled with some water opposite to the coals to catch any drippings. Place a wire rack on the grill. Cover the grill to allow the smoke to accumulate and preheat to about 225 degrees F.In a small bowl, add the granulated garlic, black pepper, salt, mustard powder, paprika and cayenne, and mix well. Rub the spice mixture all over the prime rib, then set aside. Combine the oregano, rosemary and thyme and tie together with butcher\\'s twine. In a large cast-iron pan set over medium-high heat, add the oil. Rub the oil all over the pan using the herb bundle, then set aside. Place the prime rib fat-side down in the pan and sear until browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Flip over and sear the other side until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn on its end and sear for 2 minutes.Place the prime rib on the grill over the aluminum pan, with the thick end facing the coals. Place the lid on the grill. Smoke the prime rib until the internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F for medium-rare, 2 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours.Remove the prime rib to a baking sheet and set aside to rest.For the sauce: In a medium saute pan set over medium-high heat, add the garlic, parsley, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, salt, shallots and butter. Cook, stirring continuously, until the butter foams and the garlic turns a light golden color, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the broth, Worcestershire and demi-glace. Stir to combine, and cook until the sauce reduces by one-third, remove from the heat and set aside.If the chine bone has been removed, slice the prime rib into generous 1-bone portions. Otherwise, slice off the bone and cut into generous portions, and then place on a platter. Spoon the sauce over the top, and serve."

S'In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, preheat the canola oil to 375 degrees F. Using a mandoline or sharp knife, slice the pickles into 1/8-inch-thick rounds.Place the panko breadcrumbs into a food processer and pulse until finely ground, 3 to 4 pulses. Place the panko into a medium mixing bowl and add the granulated garlic, paprika and some salt and pepper. Place the flour into a separate medium mixing bowl. Place the buttermilk into another medium mixing bowl and season with the hot sauce.Begin coating a few pickle slices at a time by first dredging into the flour and patting off the excess. Then place the floured slices into the buttermilk. Allow the excess to drip off, then transfer to the seasoned panko. Coat in panko then set aside. Repeat until all of the slices are coated.To fry, carefully place a few battered pickles into the hot oil. Cook until golden brown on the first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Then carefully turn over and cook for 2 minutes more. Using a slotted spoon or sieve, remove the pickles and place onto a paper-towel-lined dish to drain. Season with salt and serve hot with the Buttermilk Dipping Sauce.'

S'To prep the shrimp: Whisk together the wine, garlic, red pepper, salt and lemon juice. Slowly pour in the olive oil. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, pickle the onions. Combine in a medium sauce pot, red wine vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper and water. Bring to a boil and pour over the onions. Let cool and then refrigerate.In another small saucepan, place the 1 cup of balsamic over medium heat and reduce until the vinegar becomes syrupy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit at room temperature until ready to use. May need to reheat for use.Have the grill preheated to medium-high.Drain shrimp and reserve the marinade. Wrap 1 prosciutto strip around each shrimp and place 2 shrimp on each skewer, leaving a little room between each shrimp. Brush each of the skewers with some of the reserved marinade and place on the grill. Grill the shrimp until the prosciutto is crispy and the shrimp turn opaque and are cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.In a large bowl, dress the arugula and the pickled onions with remaining balsamic, a splash of olive oil, salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish and top with the shrimp skewers. Drizzle the balsamic reduction over the top.'

S'Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Season the chuck with the salt and pepper, to taste.  In a large oven safe Dutch oven (prefer porcelain coated cast iron) over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat until just smoking.  Add the beef in batches, being careful not to crowd and be sure to brown the meat on all sides.  Remove the meat from the pan to a baking sheet, or something that can catch the juices. Add the onions and carrots to the Dutch oven and pan and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, the moisture from the onions will loosen the fond, so stir often.  Add the peppers and the shallots and cook until caramelized and all of the liquid is evaporated.  Stir in the tomato paste and allow to cook out the raw acidic flavor, about 1 minute. Add in the caraway, sweet and hot paprika, the red chili flakes, the marjoram, and thyme.  Deglaze with the balsamic and let reduce for 2 minutes.  Slowly add the stock, then add the beef and any juices collected from the meat.  Add the bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and stir gently to combine.  Cover and cook in the preheated oven for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve with Grilled Polenta, if desired.'

S'Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a large skillet or roasting pan in the oven to preheat while you prepare the chicken.Begin by preparing a lemon butter. Place 4 tablespoons of the butter in a mixing bowl and add about 1 teaspoon of zest from the lemons. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.Flatten the chicken by cutting out the backbone and flattening the breast by firmly pressing with the heel of your hand. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. Using your fingers, loosely separate the skin from the breast and thighs. Smear the lemon butter evenly in the cavity between the skin and meat, ensuring it is worked evenly over the bird. With the skin side facing up, drizzle olive oil over the chicken.Remove the preheated pan from the oven and place the chicken in the pan, skin-side down.Place the lemon slices over the bird along with fennel, onions, garlic, thyme and oregano. As it cooks, this will flavor the bird.Place in the oven and roast for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, flip the chicken to skin-side up and add half the wine to the pan. Return to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the joint between the leg and thigh registers 165 degrees F, approximately 30 minutes longer. When the chicken is done, remove from the pan to a serving platter and allow to rest for 15 minutes before carving and plating.Meanwhile, make a pan sauce. Place the chicken pan over medium-high heat and add the remaining butter and wine. Stir until the butter is melted and the sauce thickens slightly. Pour the pan sauce over the platter of chicken. Serve immediately.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Place the clams in a large bowl and cover with cool tap water. Salt the water well and let the clams sit for 20 minutes to an hour to purge them of sand and grit. Drain and scrub the shells well under cold running water.Set a large roasting pan across two burners. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Add the chile, fennel and sausage, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally to break up the sausage.Once the sausage is nicely browned, deglaze the pan with the white wine. Add the clams and stir everything together until well combined. Arrange the tomatoes on top, add the thyme, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the clams pop open and the cherry tomatoes are roasted and juicy, 10 to 12 minutes.Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the linguine until al dente. When the clams are done, return the roasting pan to the stovetop over high heat. Simmer to reduce excess liquid and to open any clams that are still closed (stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon also helps).Taste sauce and season with salt as needed.Drain the pasta and transfer it directly into the roasting pan. Add the butter, lemon zest and juice, and the parsley. With tongs, toss everything together to coat the pasta in the sauce.Serve topped with plenty of grated pecorino if using.'

S'Begin by poaching the whole crabs: To prepare the crabs, set a large pot of cold water with the garlic, bay leaves, black peppercorns, kosher salt and chili flakes over high heat. Bring to a boil, and then drop in the crabs. Once the water starts to boil again, reduce the heat and simmer for 12 to15 minutes. When the crabs are done, shock them in cold water so they stop cooking. Then break each one into 4 pieces, with the pieces cracked to let the sauce in.For the cioppino: In a large stockpot over medium heat, heat the oil and cook the onions, fennel and bell peppers until lightly browned. Add the minced garlic and tomato paste and cook until it browns, stirring often. Add the tomato sauce, 4 cups water, wine, clam juice, lemon juice, sambuca, half the parsley, the chili flakes, salt, basil, oregano, pepper and bay leaves, and simmer for 1 hour.Add the pieces of cooked crab to the sauce and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the clams and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the fish and shrimp and cook until the shrimp turn pink, 4 to 5 minutes. DO NOT STIR. Remove the bay leaves, stir in the remaining chopped parsley and serve immediately with bread.'

S'In a medium bowl, add the cherries and the spiced rum.  In another bowl add the pineapple and the 3/4 cup of rum. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.In a large bowl, add 1 3/4 sticks butter and the sugar and cream together until pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Stir in the eggs 1 at a time. Add the vanilla extract and set aside.In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir until a smooth batter forms.In a 10-inch cast iron skillet, over medium heat, add the remaining 1/4 stick butter and heat until the butter has just melted. Add the brown sugar and using a slotted spoon, add the pineapple pieces, reserving the rum. Saute until they begin to caramelize, about 4 minutes. Add the cherries and the rum they soaked in. Remove the skillet from the heat and light the rum with a long kitchen match. When the flames subside, return the pan to the heat and cook until most of the alcohol has evaporated. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside to cool 6 to 10 minutes before adding the batter. Remove half the fruit back into the reserved rum for garnishing later.Add the batter to the skillet and put in the oven. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for about 5 minutes before unmolding. To unmold, run a small knife around the edge of the cake, take a large serving plate and put it over the cast iron skillet. Carefully flip over and let sit for a couple of minutes until it releases from the skillet.Put the creme fraiche in a small bowl and stir in the zests. Cut the cake into wedges and serve with a dollop of creme fraiche and the reserved fruit.'

S'In a small bowl, combine chili powder, cayenne, granulated garlic, and flour. Set aside. In a heavy bottomed, large stock pot, heat canola oil over medium-high heat. Add beef cubes and brown on all sides. Add onions and jalapenos and saute for 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute more. Mix in flour mixture, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes. Deglaze with beef broth. Then add vinegar. Stir well to combine. Bring to a boil.  Lower heat to medium-low and simmer for 2 hours, adding additional beef broth, if necessary, to keep meat simmering in liquid.  When meat is fork tender, remove to a sheet pan and shred with 2 forks. Add shredded beef back into pot, along with pinto and black beans, lime juice and half the cilantro. Cook until mixture is heated through.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large, deep-sided skillet, heat corn oil to 325 degrees F.  While oil is heating, prepare chimichangas. Fill bottom half of a tortilla with 3/4 cup of the beef and bean mixture and 2 tablespoons pepper jack cheese (when filling tortillas, use a slotted spoon to scoop out beef if mixture is a little liquidy).  Lift the edge of the tortilla and roll it over the filling to secure it. Fold in both sides and continue rolling until you reach the opposite end. Secure with a 6-inch skewer weaved through the seam side of burrito.  Repeat with remaining tortillas. Slowly lower chimichangas into hot oil and cook 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown.  You can cook 4 burritos per batch.  Remove from oil, drain on paper towels and keep warm in oven until all are cooked.To serve, place a bed of shredded lettuce on each plate, then a spoonful of salsa. Place chimichangas on top and add a dollop of sour cream, sprinkle with diced tomatoes, avocado and remaining cilantro to garnish.  Serve immediately.Note:  If tortillas tear while folding, make them more pliable by wrapping tortillas in a damp paper towels, then fully cover with foil.  Place in 250 degree F oven to warm them up.'

Stir until the salt is dissolved. Add the wings and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.To make the basting and dipping sauce, combine the remaining chili-garlic sauce, remaining honey, sweet soy sauce, Sriracha, low-sodium soy sauce, ginger and vinegar in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside half of the sauce for serving in order to avoid contamination.Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Drain the wings and sprinkle them with sea salt and pepper. Grill the wings until golden, 15 to 20 minutes, turning as needed. When the wings reach the right color, continue cooking over indirect heat until they\\'re at the desired doneness, then baste them with the sauce, turning as needed until the wings are glossy and well coated. Garnish the wings with the green onions and sesame seeds and serve with the reserved dipping sauce."

S'Put 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F) in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside to bloom, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl.Add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture and mix with the dough hook on the lowest setting until the dough comes together. Increase the speed to medium and continue to mix until the dough is elastic and smooth, about 8 minutes.Form the dough into a ball, place in a large oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat it with oil. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest in a warm place until doubled in size, 30 to 35 minutes. Line a baking sheet with foil or a silicone baking mat, coat generously with cooking spray and set aside.Punch down the dough, then turn out onto a floured surface. Knead just until the dough is smooth and springs back when poked, about 1 minute. Divide into 4 pieces and form into 5-by-3-inch oblong rolls. Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheet and cut four 2-inch diagonal slashes across the top of each. Cover with a damp towel or cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and bring 8 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat.Stir the baking soda into the boiling water (it will foam up slightly). Add 2 rolls and poach 2 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, remove the rolls, drain and place on the baking sheet, cut-side up. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining rolls.Bake the rolls until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly on the baking sheet.Photograph by Victor Schrager'

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S'Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.Add the spinach to a colander, and press down to remove as much water as possible. Transfer the spinach to a double layer of paper towels and press and squeeze to remove any extra water. Chop the spinach and add it to a medium bowl with the remaining ingredients, except the extra-virgin olive oil. The mixture should be very well combined and moist, but not wet.Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions and form into flat patties, about 3 inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick. Arrange the patties on the baking sheet and press down until very firm. This step can be done ahead, but be sure to refrigerate the patties.In a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil. When hot, add the spinach tostadas into the pan, cook about 2 minutes, gently turn and cook the other side. They will be slightly browned. Put them on a paper towel lined baking sheet, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and hold in a warm oven.Topping: In a small bowl combine the sour cream and lime zest and set aside, set aside.In the same pan the spinach tostadas were cooked in, heat the remaining oil left in pan, over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add in the shallot and cook until translucent. Add in the tomatoes, potatoes and capers, stir to combine, add in the shrimp and stock and cook until shrimp turn pink. Stir in the pepper and the parsley and remove from the heat.Remove the spinach tostadas from the oven, and transfer to a serving platter. Equally portion the shrimp mixture on each tostada, sprinkle with feta, top with a small dollop of the sour cream mixture and serve immediately.'

Continue to whisk until the mixture starts to tighten up, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the fresh chopped herbs, 2 tablespoons of the butter and the Parmesan.  Continue to stir until well combined and very thick, taste for seasoning adjustment.Liberally butter a 10-inch springform pan on the bottom and about 2-inches up the side.  Pour in the hot polenta and with a rubber spatula, rubbed with butter, smooth out the top.  Set aside to cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours to set. (This can also be done up to 1 day ahead.)Preheat a grill to medium.When ready to grill, or pan fry, remove the polenta from the pan and cut it into equal pie shapes or cut circles with a biscuit cutter.  Lightly oil a grill, brush each side of the polenta with olive oil and grill or pan sear until golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Arrange the polenta on a serving platter and serve hot.'

S"For the soba noodle salad: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook the soba noodles until just tender according to package directions, 6 to 7 minutes. Reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water, drain and run the noodles under cool water to stop cooking and ensure they stay firm. Drizzle with a little sesame oil and toss so they don\\'t stick together. Set aside.For the peanut dressing: Place the sesame oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and ginger and lightly saute (take care to not overheat as the sesame oil burns easily). You just want to gently warm and infuse the oil to cook the garlic and ginger, about 2 minutes. Add to a blender with the peanut butter, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, Sriracha and reserved soba cooking water (hot). Blend until completely smooth.  Taste and season with salt and pepper.Mix together the carrots and scallions with the noodles in a large mixing bowl. Dress with the peanut dressing then serve garnished with the chopped roasted peanuts."

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Add half of the oil to a large saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Once hot, cook the onions, bell peppers, jalapeno, olives and capers until just softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and sweat until just aromatic, about a minute. Stir in the tomato paste and deglaze with the red wine. Stir in the tomatoes and bring the pan to medium-high heat. Reduce until the liquid is almost evaporated, about 7 minutes. Fold in the oregano, mixing well. Continue cooking until the stuffing is a thick, pulpy consistency, about 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat.Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool.Score both sides of the fish. Stuff the cavity of the fish, using about half of the stuffing; set the remaining stuffing aside. Secure with three evenly spaced lengths of kitchen twine.Bring the remaining oil to medium-high heat in a large, nonstick skillet. Sprinkle the fish on both sides, and place in the skillet once the oil begins to smoke lightly. Sear until the skin browns on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a fish spatula, flip the fish gently, and then place the whole skillet onto the middle rack of the oven. Bake until the fish is golden brown, the flesh flakes easily and the stuffing is hot throughout, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the skillet and place onto platter with the julienned bell peppers and jicama, if desired.Put the skillet back over medium-high heat and add the remaining stuffing. Deglaze the pan with the vermouth and stir to combine. Cook for about 1 minute. Remove the kitchen twine from the fish. Garnish the fish with the crispy tortilla strips, the stuffing and a squeeze of lime juice.To serve: Transfer portions to plates. Garnish with lime wedges and serve with a nice, cold Mexican beer.'

S'For the marinade: With a sharp knife, clean the chops, trimming away the excess fat cap and any bone fragments. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the mint, parsley, rosemary, thyme, lemon juice, bay leaf, salt and pepper with the olive oil. Place the lamb chops into large resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over the top. Marinate for up to an hour.For the tapenade: In a food processor, pulse together the olives, orange zest, parsley, anchovy and chile until coarsely chopped. Drizzle in the olive oil and orange juice while continuing to pulse for about a minute, until the ingredients are incorporated and the tapenade is a coarse paste. Do not over process. Season with salt and pepper.For the t-bone lamb chops: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Using tongs and an oil-blotted paper towel, wipe down the grill grates to clean and create a nonstick surface. Remove the lamb from the marinade, wiping off excess, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the chops onto grill, fat-side down. Grill for about 2 minutes and rotate 45 degrees to form a crosshatch mark. Continue grilling for another 2 minutes and flip. Rotate the lamb chops 45 degrees to finish and bring to desired cooking temperature, 5 to 6 minutes total for 135 degrees F internal temperature or medium-rare. Remove from the grill and allow to rest.To serve: Arrange the lamb chops on serving dish, garnishing each with about 1 tablespoon tapenade, finishing with torn mint and serving with remaining tapenade on the side.'

S'Pork: In medium bowl, add soy and oyster sauce, ginger and garlic, and sesame oil. Add pork and let marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator.Heat grill to medium-high, and grill pork on both sides until done. Heat remaining marinade to 165 degrees F and use to baste meat as it cooks. When meat is almost cooked through, glaze both sides with sweet and sour sauce and let finish cooking while sauce caramelizes on meat. Remove from grill, allow to stand for 10 minutes, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.Rice: While pork is standing, heat oil in wok or large skillet on high heat until oil almost begins to smoke. Add ginger, as well as all vegetables except garlic. Cook for 3 minutes, or until vegetables are cooked, then add garlic. Before garlic browns, add rice and mix rapidly so rice does not stick to sides of wok or pan.Once entire mixture is thoroughly combined, pour beaten eggs over rice and vegetables, and toss again rapidly until all egg is cooked. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Mix thoroughly and then add pork.Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.'

S"For the noodles and dressing: Begin by making the dressing. In a large bowl, combine the miso, soy sauce, 1/4 cup hot water, mirin, canola oil, rice vinegar and sesame oil. Whisk together well and set aside.In a large pot of salted boiling water, blanch the sugar snap peas until bright green and just tender, 10 to 15 seconds. Set aside. Add the soba noodles to the hot water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Then strain and rinse under cold running water (this will stop the cooking process and gives the soba noodles their distinctive springy texture). Toss the noodles in the dressing and fold in the sugar snap peas and julienned carrot. Set aside until ready to serve.For the seared ahi tuna: In a large mixing bowl, make a quick marinade of the canola oil, sweet soy sauce, yuzu, sesame oil and ginger. Whisk together to combine. Carefully cut the tuna into 1 1/2-inch cubes and place in the marinade and toss to coat well (it will be a very light coating/marinade as the tuna shouldn\\'t be too wet when searing).Thread 4 pieces of tuna per bamboo skewer (4 cubes per skewer, 8 skewers total). Mix the sesame seeds together and spread out on a flat platter. Take each skewer and press the tuna into the sesame seed mixture so it is well coated on all 4 sides.Heat a flat grill plate to high heat. Brush lightly with some oil to clean the grates and create a nonstick surface. Grill the tuna skewers just a few seconds on each of the 4 sides so the sesame seeds are toasted and crunchy and the tuna is rare in the middle, 30 to 35 seconds.Serve the tuna skewers on a bed of the dressed soba noodles and garnish with some sliced scallions."

S'Begin by placing the whole chicken, breast-side down, on the preparation surface. Using kitchen shears, remove the backbone by cutting up from the tailbone to the neck on both sides. Open the bird, remove the breastbone and wishbone. Make small cuts on both sides below the thighs to tuck the wings under so you have a flattened "spatchcock" chicken.For the brine: To a small saucepan, add 1 cup water, the salt, sugar, bay leaves and garlic cloves. Bring to a simmer to dissolve the salt and sugar. Once at a simmer, turn off the heat and add the ice. Once the liquid is cool, place into a resealable bag over a bowl and add the chicken to the brine, making sure it is completely submersed. Allow to brine in the fridge for 1 hour.For the Huli Huli sauce: In a small saucepot over medium-low heat, combine the pineapple juice, ketchup, soy sauce and sherry vinegar. Once the liquid simmers, whisk in the brown sugar and ginger. Continue to simmer until the liquid begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand (or prepare ahead and refrigerate until ready for use). Once ready for use, reserve about a cup to serve.Preheat a grill to medium heat.For the dry rub: Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry. Thoroughly mix the garlic powder, salt, paprika, cayenne, onion powder, cumin and some black pepper together in a small bowl. Coat the chicken with the dry rub, making sure to sprinkle well inside the cavity. Lay the chicken flat on the preparation surface, making a neat, rectangular package with the thighs tucked next to the breasts and the wings inserted into the slits.To grill: Secure the chicken in a medium rectangular wire-mesh grilling basket and set over an open grill flame. Char with the breast side down first, 7 to 8 minutes. Turn once and continue to grill, bone-side down for another 15 minutes.Continue to turn as it cooks so it doesn\\\'t burn and it replicates the Huli Huli machine cooking process. Squeeze the lemon juice over the chicken as you turn it. Finish by alternating sides until the chicken is thoroughly browned, the skin is crispy and a digital instant-read thermometer tucked under the breast confirms the internal temperature is 165 degrees F.  The total cook time will be 35 to 40 minutes. With a heat-resistant silicone pastry brush, glaze the chicken with the Huli Huli sauce the last 5 minutes. Remove from the basket and allow the chicken to rest for 6 to 8 minutes.To serve: Carve the chicken into breasts, thighs and wings. Arrange on a large serving dish alongside the reserved Huli Huli sauce.'

S'For the rice: Wash the rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepot over high heat, bring the chicken broth to boil. Add the rice, cover and reduce the heat to low for about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. (Alternatively, add both the rinsed rice and the chicken broth to a rice cooker and turn the machine on - it will keep the rice warm until ready to serve.) Fluff with a fork and cover. Keep warm until ready for use.For the burgers: Mix the ground beef, onions and some salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Form 4 medium patties and set aside.Set a large cast-iron pan over high heat. Add a drizzle of canola oil and set the patties in the pan. Cover pan with a lid (or a second pan) to seal in the moisture and ensure juicy patties. Cook until well browned on first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Then remove the lid, flip over, replace the lid and continue cooking to desired doneness, about 3 minutes for medium-rare. Remove the burgers and keep warm.For the gravy: Add the butter to the pan with the drippings. Saute the mushrooms and onions until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce, bring to a boil and reduce down for 2 to 3 minutes.In a separate bowl, mix the cornstarch with 1 tablespoons water to make a smooth paste. Slowly add into the gravy, stirring constantly until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm until ready for use.For the eggs: Add some canola oil to a nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Crack in the eggs and cook sunny-side up, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and keep warm. (You can flip the eggs over-easy if you want them cooked a little more.)To serve: Place the cooked rice on a plate, place the burgers on top, then the eggs and finally the gravy. Garnish with parsley and tomato if desired.'

S'For the ribs: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F and get the ribs started first.Mix together the salt, pepper and paprika. Remove the thin membrane from the bone side of the ribs and discard. Lightly sprinkle the seasoning over both sides of the ribs then place the racks, rib-side down on a baking tray. Place in the oven and bake until the ribs have a nice crust (also known as "bark") on the outside and the meat will be pulling away from the bone, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.Meanwhile, prepare the romesco sauce: Set a large saucepan over medium heat and coat with a generous amount of olive oil. Add the bread cubes and toast until golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with some salt and toss the bread cubes as they cook so they brown evenly all over. When done, remove from the pan and set aside. Add the almond slivers to the dry pan and toast until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. Coat the pan with more olive oil and add the garlic and saute until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the drained red peppers and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the tomatoes. Season with more salt and the cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid has slightly reduced, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.To a food processor, add the almonds and the tomato and bell pepper mixture. Pulse until well chopped, and then add the bread cubes and continue to process. Add the sherry vinegar and, while the processor is running, drizzle in 1/2 cup olive oil. Continue to blend until the sauce has emulsified. Taste the sauce and season once more with salt if needed.Remove the ribs from the oven, and while still hot, squeeze some fresh lime juice all over the racks. The ribs will absorb the lime juice and this will complement the rich, fatty spare ribs perfectly. Cut the ribs at every second bone and serve with the romesco sauce on the side.'

S"Special equipment: butcher\\'s twine, immersion blenderCook\\'s Note: Tie the thyme sprigs with butcher\\'s twine to help remove the sprigs easily when you\\'re ready to serve.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Sprinkle the beef evenly with the salt, pepper and granulated garlic. Truss the roast with butcher\\'s twine into a uniform shape. This will help the roast keep a uniform shape while it braises and  make for more even slices.Place the porcini mushrooms into a bowl and cover with 2 cups simmering water. Set aside and allow the mushrooms to steep and absorb the water for 20 minutes.In a large Dutch oven over high heat, add the butter and oil. When the butter foams, add the trussed beef and sear for 5 to 6 minutes per side, including the ends. Remove to a plate. In the same pot over medium high-heat, add the onions and shallots and cook until just starting to caramelize, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, celery and carrots and cook until the celery just begins to soften, about 5 minutes longer.Stir in the tomato paste and combine. Deglaze with the beef stock and wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes to burn off the alcohol from the wine. Add the savory and thyme. Strain the porcini mushrooms and add to the pot along with 1 cup of the porcini liquid. Add the beef and any juices from the beef back to the pot on top of the vegetables. Cover the pan with a tight fitting lid and place in the oven. Cook for 45 minutes, baste with pan juices, replace the cover and cook for an additional 90 minutes.Remove the beef and tent lightly with aluminum foil. Discard the thyme bundle. With an immersion blender, blend the vegetables until smooth. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, to taste.Remove the trussing string, slice across the grain into 2-inch pieces and serve immediately with the vegetable gravy."

Add more oil, if needed.To roll egg rolls, layout egg roll skin with corner facing you, place approximately 1/12th of mixture on roll and place 2 pieces of avocado on top of mixture. Fold corner over mixture, and then fold outside corners over the mixture, making a roll, 4 to 5-inches wide. Roll firmly, being careful not to tear wrapper, and seal the final edge with egg wash.Dredge the egg roll in egg wash, allow excess to drain off and submerge egg roll in oil.

Add back in 2 tablespoons of the pancetta fat and melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in the pot. Reserve the remaining pancetta fat for another use or discard.Add the onions, cabbage, carrots and thyme. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and half the pepper. Stir to coat the vegetables with the butter. Cover and cook until the cabbage is wilted and almost tender, about 10 minutes. Uncover and simmer until the cabbage is very tender, about 10 more minutes. While the cabbage cooks, add the noodles to the boiling water and cook according to the package directions.Increase the heat to high and cook, stirring, until the cabbage and onions are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Add in the garlic and capers and cook for 1 minute. Add the peas, deglaze the pan with the white wine and add the lemon juice. Add in three-quarters of the pancetta, combine well and remove from heat.Drain the noodles and add to the pot with the cabbage. Toss well to coat the noodles with the cabbage and onion mixture.

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Rub the exterior and cavity liberally with the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the garlic, carrots, celery stalk, lemon, onion and thyme. Tie the legs tightly with kitchen twine and fold the wing tips under the breasts. Place on a roasting rack in a deep pan and into oven. Roast until a digital read thermometer registers 165 degrees F and the juices run clear, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove and cool.Once cooled enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones. Shred against the grain with two forks. Cool completely.Whisk the mayonnaise, cream cheese and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl for about 30 seconds. Add the chicken, diced celery, grapes and apples. Toss to evenly coat. Fold in the walnuts, parsley and tarragon until thoroughly incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.To assemble, use a preheated panini press on the highest setting. If unavailable, bring the oven to 400 degrees F and use two cast-iron skillets to form a press.Cut the focaccia quarters in half with a sharp serrated knife and arrange on a prep surface. Spoon about 1 1/4 cups of the chicken salad onto each bottom half. Replace the top half. Place onto the press and crisp until the bread is golden on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes. If using skillets, place the sandwich into the bottom pan, place the second skillet bottom on top of the sandwich and crisp, flipping halfway through the cooking process.To serve: Remove the sandwiches from the press or oven to a prep surface. Cut in half diagonally with a sharp serrated knife and arrange on serving plates. Enjoy immediately.'

S'In a food processor, pulse together chicken, eggs, garlic, 2 tablespoons ginger, scallions, salt, flour, cornstarch and panko until well combined. Form chicken mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. To prevent mixture from sticking to your fingers, wet hands with water between rolling balls. Place balls on a plate, without touching. Meanwhile, roughly chop the 2-inch piece of ginger and in a medium pot over high heat, bring water to boil and add ginger. Place 8 to 10 balls at a time into the water. Cook for about 6 minutes. (Balls will float to top and change color, but inspect for pink on outside.) Remove from water using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat until all balls are cooked. When cool enough to handle, thread 3 balls per bamboo skewer and set aside.To make the yakitori sauce, whisk together sake, soy sauce, mirin, honey and cornstarch in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 2 minutes.Preheat gas grill to medium heat. Place skewers on lightly oiled grill. (Wipe oil on with a paper towel.) Cook 7 to 10 minutes, turning gently as they brown lightly. When chicken is done, lightly baste balls with the yakitori sauce. Place skewers on serving plate, drizzle with additional yakitori sauce. Sprinkle with cilantro, green onion, sesame seeds and cayenne pepper. Serve immediately with Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce.'

S'Place the bell peppers over the flame of a gas burner to char, turning, 3 to 4 minutes per side (or char the peppers under the broiler, turning, 5 minutes). Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow the peppers to steam about 10 minutes. Once cool to the touch, remove the peppers from the bowl and pull off the charred skin and stems and remove the seeds. Slice and set aside until ready to use.Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, then the shallots and garlic; season with salt and pepper and cook until the garlic is fragrant and the shallots are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and wine and cook until most of the wine has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add both cans of tomatoes and the roasted red peppers. Mix well and bring to a steady boil, then reduce the heat so the sauce simmers.Meanwhile, prepare the kale by removing and discarding the stems; tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. Fold the kale into the tomato sauce along with the chicken and toss to combine. Cover and cook until the kale has wilted, about 5 minutes. If the sauce seems dry, add the chicken stock 1/2 cup at a time. Continue cooking, covered, until the kale is tender, all the flavors have come together and the sauce is thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve about 1 cup cooking water, then drain the pasta and add it directly to the Dutch oven with the finished sauce. Drizzle in some olive oil. Cook over low heat, tossing to coat everything, 2 to 3 minutes. (This allows the last cooking of the pasta to be done in the sauce.) Add a little of the reserved pasta water if needed. Serve the pasta in large bowls and top with spoonfuls of parmesan, more red pepper flakes and another drizzle of olive oil.Photograph by David Malosh'

S'Prepare the compound butter: Using a fine zester, grate the zest off the lemons, grapefruit and orange. Reserve the citrus for the marinade. Add the zest to a mixing bowl with the butter, Fresno chile, minced shallot, chives, 1 teaspoon salt and a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper. Mix together well and set aside.Marinate the chicken: Slice the citrus into 1/4-inch rounds and add to a large baking dish with the garlic, orange juice, olive oil, Dijon, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Mix well to combine. Add the chicken breasts and toss well to coat, using your hands or tongs to squash the citrus and massage it into the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 45 minutes.Heat a grill to medium-high. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Remove the chicken from the fridge and allow to come to room temperature. Remove from the marinade and discard. Season the breasts on both sides with salt and 4 to 5 turns of freshly ground black pepper. Place the chicken skin-side down on the grill, and cook for about 2 minutes. Rotate 90 degrees and cook for another 2 minutes; this creates nice cross-hatch sear marks on the chicken. Turn the chicken breasts over and repeat the same cooking process on the second side.Once the chicken is marked off, place it on a baking sheet skin-side up. Brush the top of the chicken liberally with the citrus compound butter. Finish cooking in the oven until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to rest for 4 to 5 minutes. Slice the breasts by removing the meat from the bone and cutting into thick slices (or serve whole individual portions). Top with a small spoonful of remaining compound butter so it melts into chicken as it is served.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the squash in half on the equator and remove the seeds with a spoon. Cut a flat spot on each end so the squash will sit flat. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange the squash, cut side up. To 3 of the squash halves, add a peeled shallot and to the other 3 add 2 garlic cloves on each. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with 1 tablespoon each of the salt and freshly cracked pepper. Roast in the hot oven until very tender and starting to caramelize and collapse, approximately 1 hour. Remove from oven and when cool enough to handle, remove the squash from the skin. Reserve the roasted shallots and garlic with the squash. Can be done ahead.In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat and when the butter is starting to foam, add the raw diced shallots and saute until they are starting to caramelize, about 5 to 6 minutes. Deglaze with 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and stir to remove any fond. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add in the reserved squash, roasted shallots and garlic and then the remaining chicken stock. Stir to combine, then puree with a stick blender. The mixture will be very thick. Add in the cayenne, white pepper and the herbs. Stir in the cream and Worcestershire sauce and heat slowly over medium-low heat. When the mixture comes to a slow simmer, mix again with the stick blender and stir in 1/4 cup of the Parmesan and turn heat to low. Serve with a fresh crack of black pepper, a nice drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a light sprinkle of remaining Parmesan. Ladle into soup bowls and serve.'

S"For the roast pork: In a food processor, combine the oil, vinegar, wine, chipotles, cilantro, cumin, oregano, salt, agave, pepper, cayenne and garlic. Pulse to the consistency of a smooth, loose paste.With a sharp knife, score the fat-side of meat 1/4-inch deep, making in a diamond pattern. Place the pork fat-side up in a roasting pan. Rub the marinade into the pork, making sure to get into all the crevices. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, for best results, overnight.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.One hour prior to cooking, remove the pork from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature. Remove the plastic wrap and set the meat fat-side up on a rack in a deep roasting pan. Cook uncovered for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 300 degrees F and cook another 3 1/2 to 4 hours, until the internal temperature registers 180 to 185 degrees F and the skin is crispy. (If the pork begins to brown too much on top, cover it loosely with foil.)Cut away the pork skin (the chicharron), chop it finely, and set aside 1/2 cup for the mofongo. Let the meat rest 20 to 30 minutes before shredding.For the sopa de pollo: Set a medium saucepan over medium heat and add enough canola oil to coat the pan. Add the onions, peppers and garlic and sweat until translucent and fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle with salt. Add the chicken and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with the chicken broth. Add 1 cup water, bring to a gentle boil, then simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes. Stir in the cilantro and add salt to taste.For the mofongo: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Slice off the top of the garlic head, cutting away just enough to expose the cloves. Set the garlic on a double layer of aluminum foil and drizzle with the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Close the foil tightly to create a pouch, and transfer it to a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the cloves turn golden brown. Let rest until cool enough to handle. Working over a bowl, squeeze the bottom of the garlic head to release the cloves. Set aside.Set a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crispy and well browned. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.In a deep pot or Dutch oven, heat 3 inches of oil to 325 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the plantains in the oil until golden and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. When cool enough to handle, smash the plantains with a spatula or the side of a knife, then return them to the oil. Fry a second time, until they\\'re just starting to brown. Drain on paper towels and season with salt as the plantains come out of the oil.To assemble: In a large, heavy metal mixing bowl, combine the fried plantains, the roasted garlic, the bacon, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and the reserved 1/2 cup pork skin, as well as the cilantro, scallions and lime juice. Toss to mix. Season with salt and pepper. Scoop out individual portions of mofongo using an ice cream scoop and transfer to shallow bowls. Ladle some of the sopa de pollo over the top or serve it in small bowls on the side. Top the mofongo with some of the shredded pork. Serve."

S'Layer two 15-inch sheets of heavy-duty foil and fold them together around the edges to create one sheet. Repeat to make a second double-layered sheet of foil. Bend the edges of one of the sheets up 2 inches and crimp the corners so it can hold liquid.In order, layer these ingredients on the bent sheet of foil: olive oil, onion, jalapeno, bell pepper, chicken, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, the garlic, cilantro, cheeses, lime juice and tequila. Place the second double-layered foil sheet on top of the ingredients and fold the top and bottom sheets together on all sides. Make sure the package is not leaking, then refrigerate until ready to cook.Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F or a grill to medium and place the foil packet in the oven or on the grill. Cook 10 minutes; flip and cook 10 more minutes. Slice the bag open and top with the tomatoes, cilantro and parmesan cheese. Serve on the warmed rolls.Photograph by Andrew McCaul'

S"For the ravioli: Heat the oil in a medium saucepot over medium heat. Add the shallots and sweat until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Deglaze with the white wine. Bring to a gentle simmer and add 1/2 stick of the butter. Stir until melted. Add the basil, parsley and tarragon. Add the lobster pieces and poach in the liquid until almost cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest and lemon juice. Remove from the heat, transfer the lobster to a dish and set aside to cool. Reserve the liquid.Bring a medium saute pan to medium-low heat. Add the flour and toast gently for about a minute. Add the salt and pepper and the remaining 1/2 stick butter, stirring constantly. Cook until the starch begins to dissipate, about 3 minutes; be careful to not allow the roux to darken. Whisk the reserved poaching liquid into the roux until smooth. Simmer until the starch is completely cooked out and the sauce is thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, transfer to a medium mixing bowl and cool completely.Gently fold the lobster into the thickened poaching liquid. Lay out the wonton wrappers, working in small batches so they don\\'t dry out. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each, brush the edges with water to moisten, place a second wonton over top and press to adhere. Use an inverted 2-inch cookie cutter (the smooth side) to gently seal the filling into the middle (this ensures a snug fit and no air bubbles which will make the ravioli burst when poached). Use a 3-inch cookie cutter (the sharp side) to cut out and create round raviolis.Bring 2 quarts well-salted water to a simmer in a large pot. Working in batches, simmer the ravioli until they are al dente, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.Meanwhile, make the brown butter sage sauce: Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and cook, stirring until it melts and becomes foamy. Once the butter turns golden brown and has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes, add the capers, sage and garlic. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Once the sage is fragrant, remove the skillet from the heat and fold in the parsley, tarragon and lemon juice. Stir to incorporate and warm up the herbs and lemon -- this will release their aroma but they\\'ll maintain their bright vibrant color.To heat and serve: Working in batches to not overcrowd the pan, gently toss the poached ravioli in the brown butter in a large saute pan for 1 to 2 minutes over medium heat to coat the pasta evenly. Place the ravioli on plates and spoon over sauce from the pan. Top with shaved Parmesan, garnish with basil buds and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil."

S"Special equipment: 7-inch round waffle iron, 8 bamboo skewersFor the brine: To a saucepan, add 2 cups water, the salt, sugar, red chile flakes, peppercorns, garlic thyme leaves and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer to dissolve the sugar and salt. Once boiling, remove from the heat and add the ice. Once the liquid is cool, place into a freezer bag, and add the chicken to the brine, making sure it is completely submerged. Refrigerate for 1 hour.For the waffle batter: Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In a separate bowl, beat together the buttermilk, butter and eggs. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients to the dry while stirring with a whisk. Mix until well combined and there are no lumps. Cover with plastic wrap.Pour the waffle batter into the waffle iron and cook according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Repeat for the remaining waffle batter.For the mayo: Whisk together the honey, mayonnaise, Sriracha, garlic powder, onion powder and salt, and set in the refrigerator to allow flavors to come together.For the slaw: Mix mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard and vinegar together in a large bowl. Then add green cabbage, carrot, red cabbage, red onion and apple. Season with salt and pepper. Stir well so everything is coated evenly. Keep the slaw refrigerated until ready to use.For fried chicken: Combine the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, Italian seasoning, paprika and black pepper. In a separate shallow dish, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk and hot sauce. Dredge each piece of chicken in the flour mixture, then into the egg, shake off excess, and then back into the flour mixture.Heat the canola oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken in the hot oil until golden and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place the cooked chicken onto a rack on a sheet tray and keep warm while you finish cooking the rest of the chicken. Place the chicken into a warm oven to keep warm and crisp while you prepare the sliders.Spread the prepared mayonnaise on the bottom waffle and top with a couple of pieces of fried chicken to create a slider. Top with a pile of slaw. Finish with the second waffle piece and hold together with a bamboo skewer. Repeat for the remaining waffles and chicken. Cut into quarters and serve."

S'Special equipment: 5-inch wooden skewers, for platingFor the blackening spice: In a small mixing bowl, combine the pepper, cumin, granulated onion, cayenne, granulated garlic, Italian seasoning, paprika, chili powder and salt. Mix to blend. Store in an airtight container if not using immediately.For the garlic butter: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and garlic, and cook until the butter has melted and garlic has become fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes. Mix in the parsley. Reserve to the side in a small bowl.For the donkey sauce: In a small mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, roasted garlic, mustard, salt, Worcestershire and pepper. Mix well. Cover and reserve.For the black and blue burger: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.Divide the ground beef into eight portions; roll each into a loose ball, then flatten into a 4-inch patty. On four of the patties, place 2 ounces of the blue cheese. Cover with a second patty and gently seal the edges to form a stuffed patty about 1 1/2-inches thick.Season the stuffed patties on both sides with the blackening spice. Grill, spaced 3 inches apart to prevent flare ups, until a crust has developed on the first side, about 3 minutes. Flip, and cook to develop a crust on the reverse side, 2 minutes. Top each burger with 2 slices of bacon and 1 ounce of the remaining blue cheese. Cover with a piece of foil and cook another 30 seconds to melt the cheese. Remove the burgers to a serving tray to rest.Lightly brush the cut sides of the brioche buns with garlic butter, and toast on the grill until crisp and golden, 5 to 10 seconds.To assemble: Smear the buns with some donkey sauce. Layer the bottom buns with pickles, onions and a burger. Top with tomatoes and lettuce. Cover with the bun tops and secure with wooden skewers. Serve.'

S'For the pork: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Season the pork with salt and pepper. Place in a braising pan and add the onion, vinegar, and BBQ sauce. Toss well. Braise for 3 hours, covered, until fork tender. Remove meat with a slotted spoon and "pull" with forks until shredded. Add braising liquid, to taste. Cool.For the slaw: Mix the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, celery salt, garlic salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the vegetables and mix thoroughly. Let sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.For the egg rolls: In large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees F. Add enough oil to keep the egg rolls from touching the bottom of the pan.In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs and milk together and set aside.With the corner of the wrappers facing you, place approximately 1/12th of the pulled pork on each wrapper. Place a dollop of coleslaw on top. Fold the corner over the filling, and then fold the outside corners in, making a roll a 4 to 5-inches wide. Roll firmly, being careful to not tear wrapper, and seal the final end with egg wash.Dredge the roll in egg wash, allow excess to drain off, and submerge the roll in the hot oil. Fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and cut on an angle, if desired.'

S'Begin by fortifying store-bought broth (this will add more depth of flavor to the finished soup). In a large stock pot, add the broth, 1 quart cold water, chicken carcasses, peppercorns, celery, carrot, onion, garlic, thyme and bay leaf. Set over medium heat and slowly bring to a rolling boil. Heating the broth up slowly will draw out the flavors of the chicken bones, vegetables and aromatics. Season lightly with salt and let the stock simmer (slightly covered) for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When done, it will have reduced by about a quarter, leaving you with approximately 3 quarts of rich stock. Strain the stock through a large sieve, discarding the bones and vegetables. Chill the stock immediately until ready to use.'

Place two roasting sheet trays in the oven to heat up (hot trays help keep the potatoes from sticking).Wash and lightly scrub the potatoes to remove any dirt or tough skin. Using a sharp knife or a mandolin, slice the potatoes lengthwise into 1/4-inch planks. Place in a large bowl or pot of water and rinse to remove excess starch. Drain well and pat dry.In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic and some salt and pepper. Add the potato planks and toss to coat everything evenly. Remove the hot trays from the oven and set out the planks on the trays in a single even layer. Lightly sprinkle the paprika on the potatoes then place the trays back in the oven and roast until golden and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes, flipping halfway. When done, use a fish spatula to remove from the trays. Season with salt and serve with ketchup.'

S'For the brine and pork chops: Combine 2 cups water, brown sugar, vinegar, 2 tablespoons salt, garlic, peppercorns, thyme, mustard powder and red pepper flakes in a large saucepan and set over high heat. Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the ice cubes to bring down the temperature. Once cooled and the ice cubes have dissolved, add to a resealable plastic container (or a plastic bag) and add the pork chops. Place in the fridge for 1 hour.Tie each pork chop around the perimeter with a piece of kitchen twine. This will help the chop retain a nice, round shape while cooking.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Remove the chops from the brine and pat dry with some paper towels (removing the excess moisture on the surface allows the pork chop to sear and caramelize). Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Set a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Coat the pan with oil and when the oil starts to smoke, add the pork chops to the pan. Cook over high heat until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the chops over and reduce the heat slightly to allow the chops to cook through. Cook on the second side until golden brown, about 8 minutes. When done, remove the pork chops from the skillet and place onto a sheet tray. Divide the slices of the Brie between the chops and layer evenly on each so they are covered well. Place the sheet tray into the oven and cook until the Brie is just melted and the pork has cooked to 140 to 145 degrees F. Remove from the oven and transfer the chops to a plate to rest.For the pan sauce: Meanwhile, place the skillet back over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and then add the apples and onions. Saute for 4 to 5 minutes, and then add the Calvados. Allow the alcohol to cook off (you can flambe at this stage if desired by igniting the Calvados in the pan). Once the Calvados has reduced, add the stock and simmer. Season with some salt and pepper. Allow to reduce for 2 to 3 minutes, and then remove from the heat and swirl in the cold butter cubes. This will thicken the sauce and give it a nice sheen. Serve the Brie-topped pork chops with the sauce.'

S'Put the mango, cilantro, lemon juice, vinegar, oil, garlic, chipotle, salt and pepper in a food processor and puree until smooth. Adjust seasonings to taste.Add the chicken with half of the chipotle-mango sauce to a resealable plastic bag, and massage to coat the chicken with the sauce. Refrigerate at least 6 hours to marinate.Put the other half of the chipotle-mango sauce into a small saucepan and simmer over low heat until thick, stirring often, about 15 minutes. Set some of the simmered sauce aside to serve on the side, and baste the chicken every few minutes with the rest of the sauce.Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat and brush with oil. Remove the chicken from the marinade and put on the grill.Grill the chicken, turning and basting about every 5 minutes, until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve with the reserved chipotle-mango sauce.'

S'Soak 5 to 8 bamboo skewers in water for about 20 minutes to keep them from burning on the grill or under the broiler.Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large skillet until halfway done, about 4 minutes. Drain and cool on paper towels. Wrap a piece of bacon around the middle of each shrimp; skewer with bamboo through the point where the bacon ends meet to keep it from unraveling. Thread 3 to 5 shrimp on each bamboo skewer.Puree the barbecue sauce, oil, lemon juice, mustard, chipotles, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper in a blender. Set aside half of the sauce for dipping.Preheat a grill, grill pan or broiler. Grill or broil shrimp (on a foil-lined baking sheet, if broiling) for 5 minutes, basting with the sauce once they begin to turn pink. Flip, baste again and grill or broil until just cooked through, about 4 more minutes. Serve with extra sauce.Photograph by James Baigrie'

S"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Sprinkle the inside of the chickens liberally with salt and pepper. Stuff each bird with 3 sprigs thyme, 2 cloves garlic, the bay leaf, onion and lemon. As the chickens cook, this will help keep them moist and also flavor the bird from the inside.Using kitchen twine, tie the legs together of each bird, and then tuck the wing tips underneath each body so it cooks evenly. Place the birds on a roasting rack over a roasting tray then sprinkle them with salt and pepper.Place in the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Then reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the joint between the leg and thigh registers 165 degrees F, approximately 1 hour more. When the chicken is done, the skin will be crispy and golden and the juices of the chicken will run clear. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes before serving.Cook\\'s Note: This is a great recipe for the week where you can use the shredded chicken meat for salads, sandwiches, pasta dishes, and stews.  Then you can also use the roasted chicken carcasses to make chicken stock, or fortify boxed broth for soups."

S'Preheat the broiler to high.Begin by making the green chile salsa: Place the chiles on a roasting tray with the garlic and onions. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt, pepper and cumin and then place under the broiler to cook, 5 to 7 minutes. Once the skins have blistered and the onions have slightly charred around the edges, remove from the oven. Let cool slightly, then remove and discard the skins of the large chiles, along with the seeds and stems. Place the chile flesh, onions and garlic in a food processor. Add the lime juice and pulse 5 to 6 times to roughly chop the vegetables up; do not over chop as you want the salsa to be chunky and still have lots of texture where you can see pieces of the chile. Taste and season once more, then set aside as you prepare the burgers.For the burgers: Preheat an outdoor grill and wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted paper towel. This not only cleans the grill but creates a nonstick surface.Form the ground brisket into four 8-ounce patties about 1/2-inch thick. Make them slightly bigger in diameter than your buns, as they shrink when they cook. Also, add a dimple in the center as the burger puffs up in the middle when cooked, and this will ensure a flat, even patty. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper, and then place on the hot part of the grill. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes on one side, then flip the patties and top with the cheese. Close the grill or place a metal bowl over the top to melt the cheese and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Cut open the hamburger buns and lightly toast on the grill.To assemble, place the lettuce, onion and tomato on the base of the burger bun. Top with a grilled patty and place a heaping spoonful of roasted green chile salsa on top. Smear the top burger bun with mayo, if desired, and place the top half of the burger bun on top. Serve.'

S"Set a large pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Sprinkle the short ribs all over with a generous amount of salt and some pepper (no flour required here!). Add the oil to the pot and brown the short ribs well on each of the 3 meaty sides, about 15 minutes total. Work in batches so as to not overcrowd the pot. You want a deep brown color on the meat as this will give the stew its rich flavor and color when braising. Remove the ribs and set aside.Add the carrots, celery and onions to the pot. Saute the vegetables until caramelized and wilted, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and toss to combine and heat through. Return the ribs to the pot and nestle in amongst the vegetables. Add the thyme, bay leaves, rosemary, stout beer, broth and tomatoes. Season lightly with salt and pepper, then stir and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer the ribs 2 1/2 hours.  Periodically skim any excess fat on the surface and discard.After 2 1/2 hours, mix in the pearl barley and dry mustard powder, then cover once more and cook 45 more minutes. When done, remove the bay leaf, thyme and rosemary stems.  Taste and season the braise with salt and pepper and serve.Cook\\'s Note: This dish pairs well with beer or zinfandel."

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the marinade: Combine the balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, thyme and garlic in a small mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside until ready for use.For the peppers: Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the peppers and continue to cook to just get a little color on the vegetables, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and saute until just fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and reserve.For the catfish: Take four 12- by 12-inch sheets of parchment paper and place on a clean work surface. Working with one packet at a time, begin by folding a piece of parchment paper in half to make a crease down the middle. Open it back up and spoon about 1/3 cup of sauteed peppers and onions onto the middle of the parchment paper. Place a fillet of fish on top. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the marinade over the top and sprinkle with salt, pepper and a pinch of paprika for color. Fold the parchment back over the fish to enclose. Working from one corner and around the fish to the other corner, make small folds that overlap one another so the packet gets tightly sealed. Continue to fold crease over crease until the packet is sealed. Tuck the last fold under the packet to hold in place.Repeat with all four packets, and then place on a sheet tray and into the oven. Bake until the packets puff up completely, 10 to 12 minutes.To serve: Open the parchment packet tops with scissors and garnish with parsley, scallions and lemon wheels.'

S'For the acorn squash: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Trim the tops and bottoms off the squash. Cut in half horizontally so the cut-ends will keep the pieces flat. Clean the inside of the squash. Separate the seeds from the membranes and rinse well. Dry the seeds with a paper towel and set aside.Place the squash cut-side up on a baking sheet, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Place the seeds on a separate baking sheet or foil. Roast the squash 30 minutes. Roast the seeds at the same time, checking and moving them around after 10 minutes and again after 20 minutes. Depending on the size of the seeds, they may be done after 20 minutes, or up to 30 minutes. Sprinkle the seeds with the remaining salt, and set aside with the squash.For the filling: Set a large saute pan over high heat and add the butter. When melted, add the cabbage, onions, peppers, sprinkle with salt and pepper and gently toss to combine. Allow the cabbage to wilt down, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and toss to combine. Saute 2 to 4 minutes longer, and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.For assembling: Preheat the broiler to low. Fill the roasted acorn squash halves with the filling. Sprinkle the crumbled goat cheese over the top, then top with the roasted squash seeds. Broil just until the cheese is warm. Garnish with a small amount of Italian parsley, if using, and serve.'

S'Preheat a grill.Place the tomatillos, poblanos and serrano chiles on a baking sheet, then drizzle with 3 tablespoons of the oil and sprinkle some salt and pepper over the top. Place the tomatillos, poblanos and serranos directly over open flames on the grill and cook until the skins are charred and black all over, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the poblanos and serranos to a large bowl, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and steam for 2 to 3 minutes. In the meantime, place the tomatillos in a food processor and set aside. Scrape away the charred skins from the poblanos and serranos. Remove the stems and seeds, and roughly chop. Add to the food processor and puree until smooth, about 2 minutes. Set the verde sauce aside for later use.Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Trim the pork ribs of any excess fat and cube the chicken thighs into large bite-size, about 1 1/2-inch cubes. Sprinkle the pork and chicken with 2 tablespoons salt, the cumin and 1 teaspoon pepper. Place a paella pan or large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the chorizo and cook to crisp up and render the fat. Remove the chorizo to a baking sheet and add the pork ribs and chicken thighs to the paella pan. Cook until the pork and chicken turn golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn the meat over and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes, then transfer to the baking sheet with the chorizo. Add the onions and red bell peppers to the pan and saute until the onions are translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the rice and garlic, and mix well until the rice is coated with oil. Cook until the rice smells nutty, 5 to 6 minutes. Add half of the broth and half of the verde sauce, and stir well to combine. Spread the rice evenly around the pan and return the chicken, pork and chorizo to the pan. Cook until the broth is absorbed, about 10 minutes, then add the remaining 3 cups broth. Once bubbling, cover with foil and transfer to the oven; cook until the rice is al dente, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil, dollop the remaining verde sauce over the top and sprinkle with the lime zest and chopped cilantro to serve.'

S'In a saute pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil is hot add the onions and saute until translucent. Stir in the artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes. Saute for 3 to 5 minutes, then add the salt, pepper and garlic. When the garlic begins to lightly brown, deglaze with 1/4 cup of the white wine. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the butter, allow it to melt, then toss in the Parmesan and parsley.Remove from the heat and allow to cool before stuffing the chicken breast.Rinse, trim and pound out chicken breasts to about 1/4-inch thick. Do not over-pound as holes in the chicken will make it difficult for the chicken to retain the stuffing.Put 1/4 of the stuffing mixture at 1 end of a chicken breast. Gentle roll the chicken breast folding the ends in to help keep the stuffing from coming out during the cooking process. Secure the chicken roll with 2 toothpicks. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts and stuffing.Heat the 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil in a medium saute pan over high heat. Add the chicken breasts, with the secured side of the chicken first, to insure the roll with stay together. Brown the chicken on all sides, add remaining butter, and deglaze with remaining white wine.Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes.Remove the chicken to a cutting board and discard the toothpicks. Slice each breast on a bias into 5 pieces and transfer to a serving platter.  Drizzle with remaining pan drippings, garnish with a sprinkle of Parmesan and serve.'

S'For the chicken and rub: Butterfly the chicken breast halves. Combine the paprika, brown gsugar, granulated garlic, granulated onion, cumin, salt, chili powder and pepper in a resealable plastic bag and shake well to mix everything together. Add the chicken breasts and shake again to coat them evenly. Set aside in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to marinate while you prepare everything else.Preheat a grill to high heat.For the BBQ sauce: Take the dried chiles, tear them up, discard the stems and seeds and place in a small bowl. Pour boiling water over them and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes to re-hydrate. Drain and discard the water.In a medium saucepan,  add the canola oil, onions and garlic. Sweat over medium heat until the onions are very soft and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chiles and bourbon and simmer for 1 minute to let some of the alcohol burn off. Add the ketchup, preserves, brown sugar and molasses and simmer for 10 minutes to let the flavors come together. Puree and set aside.Remove the chicken from the marinade and cook on the hot grill, 5 to 7 minutes per side to get some color. Remove and allow to cool. Slice on the bias into pieces.For the pizza. Dust a bench (or pizza peel if you have one) liberally with flour. Take the ball of pizza dough and press out into a disk, working it gently from the inside out. Continue to work and stretch the dough out until you have about a 12-inch circle. The crust should be nice and thin, about 1/8-inch thick. Set on a floured surface and press gently to flatten. Spread the BBQ sauce on the pizza in a very even, thin layer. Leave a border as desired around the edges. Top with the shaved red onion, slices of BBQ chicken and slices of cheese. Dot the top with extra patches of BBQ sauce. Slide the pizza into a hot pizza oven and bake until the crust is bubbly and charred around the edges, 12 to 14 minutes. (If baking at home, set a pizza stone in an oven at 500 degrees F to warm up for 1 hour).When done, remove from the oven and scatter the top with fresh cilantro leaves.'

S'Make the onions: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Add the onions and stir to coat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the onions are golden, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the bourbon, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Return to low heat, add the butter and cook until melted. Add the sugar, and salt and pepper to taste, and cook until there is very little liquid left.Meanwhile, make the aioli: Pulse all of the ingredients in a food processor until combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.Make the sliders: Preheat a grill to medium high. Form the beef into twelve 4-ounce patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Oil the grill rack, then add the patties and season with the garlic salt, and sea salt and pepper to taste. Grill until browned and cooked halfway through, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, top with some of the caramelized onions and cook 3 more minutes for medium (or to desired doneness).Meanwhile, brush the insides of the buns with butter and toast on the grill, about 1 minute. Brush the insides of the bun tops with about 1 tablespoon aioli. Put the burgers on the bun bottoms and cover with the tops. Thread each lime wedge onto a skewer; pierce the skewers through the sliders.'

Cook, whisking constantly, until the polenta tightens and there are no lumps, about 4 minutes. Stir in the queso blanco, butter, cilantro, pepper and jalapeno. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.Generously butter a 9-by-9-inch baking pan. Pour the polenta into the pan and set aside to cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours, until firm.Preheat a griddle pan over medium heat. Invert the polenta onto a clean cutting board and slice it into nine 3-inch squares. Brush the squares on both sides with the olive oil, then griddle them until golden brown and warmed through, about 3 minutes per side. While warm, drizzle the polenta cakes with the honey and squeeze lime juice over the top. Serve.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Put the poblano peppers over the flame of 1 of the burners on the stove to roast. Cook, turning often with tongs until all of the skin is blistered, about 15 minutes. Add the peppers to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to steam for about 15 more minutes. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, transfer to a cutting board, peel the skin off, remove the seeds and stems, dice, and set aside.Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat, add the onions and the salt and pepper. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes, and then set aside to cool.Heat the milk in a small saucepan just until it starts to simmer, about 3 minutes.In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and then slowly add the scalded milk. Whisk in the sour cream and then fold in the cheese, corn, peppers, onions, herbs, cayenne. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Add the mixture to a 9 by 13-inch buttered baking dish and set aside.Put the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat and add the panko. Toss to coat the bread crumbs and season with salt and pepper. Pour the bread crumbs over the pudding and bake in the preheated oven until the bread crumbs are golden, the pudding is set and bubbling around the edges and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

S'Prepare the wings: In a large bowl, combine the granulated garlic, cayenne pepper, mustard powder, black pepper, white pepper and cumin. Remove and reserve 2 tablespoons of the spice mixture for the sauce.Rinse the wings and pat dry. Add to the bowl with the remaining spice mixture and toss to coat well. Lay the wings on a baking sheet, loosely cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.Preheat a grill to medium high with direct and indirect heat (on a gas grill, turn off the burners on one side; on a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side). Cook the wings over direct heat, turning, until they are good and crispy on both sides, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to the cooler side of the grill and cook, turning frequently, until cooked through, 8 to 10 more minutes.Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the olive oil, garlic and jalapeno. Saute 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the reserved 2 tablespoons spice mixture and the hot sauce. Bring to a simmer, then add the butter, vinegar and lime juice and stir until the butter melts. Keep warm until ready to serve. Put the wings in a large bowl, pour in the sauce and toss.Photograph by Con Poulos'

S'For the green chile chicken filling: Sprinkle the chicken thighs with 1 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper and cumin. Heat the 2 tablespoons the canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, place the chicken thighs, skin side down, in the pan and cook until browned and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn the chicken over and brown on reverse side, 3 to 4 minutes; between batches, add more canola to the pot as needed). Remove the chicken to a plate and set aside.To the pot, add the potatoes, poblanos, onions, garlic, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.  Saute until the onions are translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Return the chicken thighs to the pot and deglaze with the chicken broth, stirring to scrape any browned bits. Bring to a boil, then cover and lower to a simmer. Cook until the chicken thighs are tender and the potatoes are starting to break down into the sauce, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the chicken thighs to a plate and let cool. Remove the bones from the chicken thighs and chop meat into 3/8-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken back in the pot, and bring back to a simmer. Continue cooking until the sauce has thickened and most of the liquid has evaporated, another 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm.For the guajillo sauce: Remove the stems and seeds from the guajillos; tear the chiles in half lengthwise. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, toast the chiles and garlic until they become fragrant and start to brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the chiles to a bowl and add 2 cups boiling water, or enough to just cover. Set aside to rehydrate for 15 minutes.In a blender, add the chiles with their soaking water, and the toasted garlic, oregano, cumin and chicken broth. Puree until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the guajillo puree into a pan and bring to a simmer; cook gently until slightly thickened, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat, and stir in the salt, sugar and pepper. Cover and keep warm.Make the burritos: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Place the flour tortillas on a clean flat surface. In the middle of each tortilla, place about one-quarter of the chicken filling, and top with a 1/2 cup of the Chihuahua cheese. Spread the filling out slightly. Fold in the sides of the tortillas and then carefully roll them up into burritos.In a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat, place the burritos, seam side down, and cook to lightly brown and seal, about 1 minute. Turn and cook on the reverse side. Transfer the burritos to an oven-proof platter and cover completely in guajillo sauce.  Sprinkle the remaining Chihuahua cheese over the top. Bake until the burritos are golden brown around the edges and the cheese is bubbly, 7 to 8 minutes.Garnish the burritos with a dollop of sour cream and some cilantro and scallions. Add a squeeze of lime juice and serve.'

Carefully add to the hot oil in batches (do not crowd) and cook 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with the remaining 1 to 2 teaspoons sea salt while hot.For the sandwiches: Preheat the oven to a low broil. Butter the rolls with the garlic butter and place on a baking sheet. Broil until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.Spread Donkey Sauce on both halves of each roll.

S'Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.In a large bowl, combine the flours, quick oats, flax seed, wheat germ, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and baking powder.In a stand mixer, cream together the butter, coconut oil, brown sugar, honey and peanut butter until creamy and well mixed, about 4 minutes, scraping down the bowl halfway through. Add the egg and mix until incorporated. Add the flour mixture and mix just until incorporated. Fold in the granola, cherries and coconut.In a 9 by 13-inch baking pan, place a piece of parchment across the bottom (it will extend over the long sides, but not the ends). Spray with nonstick spray. Add the dough to the pan and cover with plastic wrap. Using your hands, gently press the dough out into the pan until evenly spread. Place the pan on the middle rack and bake until the edges are starting to brown lightly and a toothpick comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes. Then gently lift the parchment out onto a cooling rack and cool completely; it will firm up as it cools, but crumble if you move it too soon. Once completely cool, move to a cutting board and cut into bars with a bench scraper or large knife, about 3 by 1-inch each.'

S'Mix 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F), the yeast and agave in a bowl. Set aside 5 minutes.In a food processor fitted with the dough blade, pulse the whole-wheat flour, 2 cups all-purpose flour and the sea salt. Add 1 egg and the yeast mixture and pulse in 10-second intervals until the dough comes together, about 3 pulses. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead 10 to 12 times, adding up to 3/4 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cut the dough into 4 equal portions; cover with a clean towel. On a floured board, roll out one piece of dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, with a shorter side facing you.  Sprinkle   1/2 cup mozzarella across the middle of the dough; fold the bottom third of the dough over the cheese, then sprinkle 2 tablespoons parmesan and 1/3 cup pepperoni over the folded part. Fold the top third of the dough over the parmesan and pepperoni. Reroll the dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle. Cut into seven 11-by-2-inch strips.One at a time, pinch the cut long edges of each strip together and roll into a 12-inch rope with your hands. Transfer the rope to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Grab the ends and bring them toward each other, forming a U shape, then cross the left end over the right end to make a pretzel shape. Cross the left end over the right again to make a twist in the middle.Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough and the remaining cheese, spacing the pretzels 3 inches apart. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes; preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl. Brush the pretzels with the egg; sprinkle with parmesan and coarse salt. Bake until browned, 16 to 18 minutes, checking on the pretzels every 5 minutes to avoid overbaking.Photograph by Victor Schrager'

S'In a deep pot, heat oil to 380 degrees F. In a small bowl, beat egg.Cut chocolate into 1/2-inch cubes. Take an egg roll wrapper, and brush edges with egg wash, and lay on a work surface, wash side up, with a point facing you, not a straight edge. Place about 2 ounces of chocolate 1 or 2 inches from the edge, and top with 1/4 cup of microwaved marshmallow or fluff. Fold the corner closest you up and just over the filling, press lightly, then fold in the sides, making a little pull or tuck to keep the roll right. Then roll away from you and press to seal tightly. (Take care not to tear the egg roll wrapper. This can cause roll to leak while cooking. If tear occurs, pinch dough together until it reseals or discard wrap and use a new one.) Repeat until all egg rolls are formed. Fry egg rolls 4 at a time, turning almost immediately, cooking on all sides to just golden brown, less than a minute. (Make sure not to overcook filling. If you see marshmallows start to ooze out before both sides are golden, filling will be overcooked and egg roll will appear hollow inside) Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat until all cooked. Make sure to check your oil temperature between additions.When ready to serve, dust with powdered sugar and graham cracker crumbs. Serve immediately, but caution very hot!'

S"For the shrimp: Soak 8 bamboo skewers in water, if grilling over an open flame (or use metal skewers).Begin by making a quick marinade. In a large mixing bowl, combine the tequila, cumin, paprika, cayenne, garlic, lime juice and a little canola oil. Add the shrimp and toss well to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Take the skewers and thread 4 shrimp per skewer.Heat up a grill, grill pan or flat top. Place the shrimp skewers on the grill and cook until pink, well-marked and nicely charred, 40 to 50 seconds. Remove from the grill and set on a large platter. Add the cilantro and finish by squeezing the lime wedges for some fresh lime juice all over (while the shrimp are warm they will soak up the lime flavor).For the spicy pink mayo: Combine the mayonnaise, Mexican crema, lime juice, agave, chipotle and adobo sauce and some salt in a mixing bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve.For the tacos: Take a large nonstick saute pan (or on a flat grill top) and spray lightly with some nonstick cooking spray. Warm a tortilla for about 30 seconds on both sides, and then lightly coat one side with a sprinkle of Parmesan. Warm through, and then flip so it toasts cheese side down. Allow the cheese to cook and brown about 15 seconds, and then remove from pan. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.To assemble: Place a skewer of shrimp on a doubled-up tortilla (cheese side up) and remove the skewer to leave the shrimp lined up in a row. Top with the diced tomato, iceberg, Cotija cheese, spicy pink mayo, lime and cilantro. Serve with beans.Cook\\'s Note: Serve with a pinot grigio."

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a small bowl, combine the spices and mix well. Rub the chicken evenly with the spice mixture and place on a baking sheet. Place in the oven and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove to cool.While chicken is cooling, unfold the filo, stacking the layers so the ends are aligned, and cut into 6-inch wide strips the length of the dough. Cover with a damp towel until ready to use.Once chicken is cool enough to handle, make a small slit in the leg and add about 1 to 2 teaspoons of the mustard. Working with 1 sheet of filo at a time, lightly brush with butter, top with another sheet, and lightly brush with butter again. Repeat so there are 3 to 4 layers of filo evenly stacked on top of one another. Roll 1 leg inside the stacked and brushed filo, leaving the bone end of the drumstick exposed. Brush lightly with butter and repeat with remaining filo and drumsticks.Return to the oven and bake until golden and crispy, 20 to 30 minutes.Serve immediately.'

S'Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.For the soup: In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, bring the oil to medium heat. Add the shallot and salt and pepper to taste. Sweat until translucent, about 1 minute, being careful not to brown. Add the asparagus to the pot and sweat until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the peas and sweat another minute. Pour in the white wine and deglaze the pot. Add 5 cups water and continue simmering until crisp-tender, another 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.Working in batches (and carefully as the liquid will be hot), puree the soup until smooth in a blender. In the last batch, add the baby spinach and puree; this will give the soup a vibrant green color. Strain back into the pot through a fine mesh sieve. Return to a simmer until slightly thickened, 4 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.For the Parmesan breadcrumbs: While the soup simmers, pulse the bread in a food processor until you have very coarse crumbs. Once processed, transfer the breadcrumbs to a medium mixing bowl. Drizzle with a generous amount of olive oil. Toss with the thyme. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Transfer to a parchment-lined sheet tray. Using a grater, finely grate a few tablespoons of Parmesan over the breadcrumbs. Place into the oven and bake until golden and crispy, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool.To serve: Ladle the soup into shallow serving bowls. Sprinkle evenly with a few teaspoons of Parmesan breadcrumbs and top with a dollop of creme fraiche. Garnish with chopped chives, cilantro leaves, a squeeze of a lime wedge and a splash of extra-virgin olive oil. Serve immediately.When blending hot liquids, first let cool for 5 minutes or so, then transfer to a blender, filling only halfway. Put the lid on, leaving one corner open; this will prevent the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters and pulse until smooth.'

Pour the potatoes over a wire mesh strainer and allow to drain.Whisk the egg and egg white in a large glass mixing bowl until just incorporated, about 30 seconds. Sift the flour, granulated garlic, cayenne and cinnamon into the egg. Add the chives. Sprinkle with 3 teaspoons each salt and black pepper; whisk until smooth. Fold in the sweet potato and potato, making sure the batter is thoroughly combined.Set a large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add the oil. Working in small batches, drop about 3 tablespoons per latke into the skillet just before the oil begins to smoke. Flatten each slightly with a slotted metal spatula. Make sure to not overcrowd the skillet.Crisp the latkes until the bottoms are caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with the spatula and continue crisping the second side for about 6 minutes total. The latkes should be cooked through and a dark, golden brown. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined dish. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, garnishing each latke center with a small dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of torn parsley leaves.'

S'Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.For the cutlets: Begin by pounding out the chicken cutlets. Working with 2 cutlets at a time, place between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, gently pound out each piece of chicken to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Work gently from the center outwards so as to keep it even and not tear the chicken. Repeat with the remaining cutlets.Set up a breading station. Place the flour in a shallow bowl, season with salt and pepper and mix well. In a second shallow bowl, add the buttermilk, season with salt and pepper and mix well. In a third shallow bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, season with salt and pepper and mix well.Take each cutlet and dredge lightly in the flour. Shake off any excess, and then dip in the buttermilk. Finally, dredge in the breadcrumb mixture. Cover evenly on both sides, gently patting the crumbs into the chicken to help it stick. Place the breaded cutlets in a single layer on a platter and place uncovered in the fridge for 15 minutes - this will help the coating stick to the cutlet and prevent tearing when it comes time to cook them.To cook the cutlets, set 2 large nonstick saute pans, cast-iron pans if available, over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to each and cook 2 cutlets in each pan for 3 to 4 minutes per side. When done, they will be golden brown and crispy. Transfer to an ovenproof pan and keep warm in the oven. Try not to keep the chicken in the oven longer than 15 minutes, otherwise it will dry out.Now make the gravy: Set a medium saute pan with high sides over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Add the garlic, onions and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Saute until the onions are lightly caramelized and tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Deglaze with the white wine and reduce for 1 minute before adding the chicken broth. Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, and then add the cold butter cubes to the sauce. Remove from the heat and swirl the pan to melt the butter evenly - this will thicken the sauce and give it a nice sheen. Serve the chicken schnitzel with the garlic-onion gravy.Wine paring: Riesling or sparkling wine.'

S'Prepare the casing.Soak the casing in cold water for 30 minutes to soften, then run water through it to remove excess salt and check for leaks. (You can buy casings from most butchers.)Blend the chiles.Remove the seeds from the chipotles, and finely chop in a food processor with the garlic, vinegar and tequila.Chop the pork.Cut any silver skin off the pork butt, then cut it into 3-inch chunks.Grind the meat.Grind the pork in a meat grinder (or mixer with a grinder attachment) with a 316-inch die. Use the feed tube to push the meat through gently.Season the meat.First, "de-bling" (take off your rings!); you\\\'ll be mixing with your hands. Combine the dry spices-cumin, salt, chili powders, onion, paprika, oregano and white pepper-in a small bowl. Then season the pork in layers: Place half the ground meat in a large bowl, cover with half the spice mixture and half the garlic-vinegar mixture, then add the rest of the meat, spices and garlic mixture. Combine everything with your hands; it\\\'s the best way to make sure all the meat gets seasoned.Thread the casing.Remove the die from the grinder and attach the sausage-stuffing tube, then slide the whole casing onto the tube, leaving enough at the end to tie into a tight knot.Stuff the casing.With the mixer on low, gently feed the sausage mixture into the tube, using one hand to guide the casing out at the right speed; be careful not to overstuff or tear the casing.Form the links.Turn off the mixer after you get about 3 to 4 feet of sausage and cut and tie off the casing. Retie the casing on the stuffing tube and continue making the remaining sausage. Pinch and then twist the long pieces of sausage about every 8 inches to form links. Place the linked sausages on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate overnight to dry.Grill the sausage.Preheat one side of a grill to medium-high and the other to low. Lightly brush the grill with oil, then grill the sausages until they\\\'re browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Move to low heat and continue grilling until they\\\'re cooked through, 5 to 7 more minutes.Photograph by James Baigrie'

Use within 2 to 3 weeks.Guy\\'s Tips:Use a good quality olive oil in this, but not extra-virgin. You want an olive oil that can withstand some heat, as you will soon be cooking everything with this oil!Find the freshest, firmest, whitest garlic bulbs you can find. Gently break apart the bulb, and then carefully trim the stem end from each clove and peel the skins. Be picky, use the biggest ones and leave the smaller ones for another recipe.Use the oil for cooking, use the garlic for everything. Once the garlic is depleted, start over."

S"For the brine: Rinse and pat the chops dry, slit a pocket into each chop about 3 to 4 inches long and as deep as the bone. Combine the remaining ingredients in a re-sealable bag, place in the refrigerator and brine for 1 to 2 hours.For the stuffing: In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the oil and butter, and when the butter melts and foams, add the pancetta and cook until crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving the fat in the pan. Add the mushrooms, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently for 6 minutes. Add the shallots, sage and 1/2 of the pancetta and cook for 3 minutes more. Remove to a plate to cool, spreading out evenly. Once cool, add the fontina cheese. Reserve the extra pancetta for service.Remove the chops from the brine and pat dry. Stuff with the cooled filling and secure the opening with toothpicks. Reserve any remaining filling for the sauce.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the breading: In a shallow pan or bowl, add the Italian seasoning, pepper, panko and flour. Mix well. Add the eggs to a second shallow bowl and beat.Dredge the chops through the egg, then lay in the breading and press to adhere. Repeat with all the chops.In a large saute pan, add the oil and bacon fat and, when shimmering, add the pork chops, cooking until golden brown, about 5 minutes each side. Hold gently with tongs and cook the edges as well. Place on a baking pan fitted with a wire rack and place into the oven. Cook until the meat registers 135 degrees F on a thermometer, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and lightly tent with foil.For the sauce: In the same pan that the chops were cooked in, add the shallots and any remaining mushroom filling and cook over medium-high heat for 4 to 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the stock and scrape any bits from the bottom. Whisk in the mustard and yogurt until well combined, and then add the lemon juice and salt.Remove the chops from the baking pan, remove the toothpicks and place on a serving platter. Top with the sauce. Garnish with the parsley and the remaining pancetta and serve immediately.Cook\\'s Note: Sauvignon Blanc makes a nice pairing for this dish."

S'Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

Remove the bacon from the pot with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the drippings in the pot.Add the flour to the drippings in the pot and stir to combine. Cook, without adding color, until the flour and fat has combined, about 1 minute. Pour in the milk while you whisk to incorporate. Cook over medium heat until bubbly and thickened, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.Scoop out the potato pulp from the skins and add to the milk mixture. Mash with the back of a wooden spoon leaving it a little bit chunky.Add the cooked bacon (leaving a little out for garnishing the soup), 1 cup of the cheese, and season well with salt and pepper. Stir until the cheese has melted. Remove from the heat.Ladle the soup into bowls, drizzle with sour cream (from a squeeze bottle), sprinkle with remaining bacon bits, grated cheese and chives.'

Fold in the cilantro and set aside until ready to use.For the fish marinade: In a large mixing bowl, combine the tequila, cumin, garlic, lime juice and some salt and pepper. Portion the fish into 1-inch cubes and add to the marinade. Set aside to marinate for 4 to 5 minutes.To cook the fish: Heat a flat top grill to high and coat with a little oil. Skewer 4 to 5 pieces of fish on each skewer. Place the skewers on the grill and cook until the fish is white and cooked through, about 1 minute on each side and about 4 minutes total. Remove the skewers and allow to rest.Warm the tortillas in batches on the grill for about 2 minutes on each side. Remove the tortillas to a towel-lined foil pouch and cover loosely to keep warm.To build the tacos, drizzle a little Cilantro Lime Crema on a tortilla. Top with some strained red cabbage mixture and then place a skewer of fish on top. Slide out the skewer so the fish stays on the taco, and then finish with more lime crema. Garnish with some crumbled Cotija and hot sauce and serve with a wedge of lime on the side. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.'

S"Peel the sides of the potatoes but leave some skin on the ends. As you peel, place the potatoes in a bowl filled with cool water.  Cut the potatoes into matchsticks (1/8-inch square) and place back into the bowl of clean cool water. Allow the potatoes to sit for 1 hour, changing the water as it becomes cloudy to remove the starch.Heat the canola oil in a large, heavy Dutch oven or deep skillet to 325 degrees F.Drain the potatoes and dry well with paper towels. Carefully add the potatoes to the oil, in batches if necessary, and cook until they just lose their opaque look and are starting to firm up, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain well on paper towels.Heat the duck fat in a heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F; ideally you want the duck fat 3 to 4 inches deep.Carefully add the fries to the duck fat and cook until crispy and evenly golden, about 8 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and season with the sea salt or truffle salt.Cook\\'s Note: Strain the duck fat through a fine mesh strainer and transfer to a glass container. Keep refrigerated or frozen for up to 6 months."

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the white sauce: Bring a medium saucepan to low-medium heat and add the butter. Once the butter is melted, stir in the flour with a wooden spoon; cook for 2 minutes (do not let it color). Add the milk and bring to a boil, continuing to stir. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 minute. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add in the Parmesan, whisking to incorporate. Season with salt and pepper.For the lasagna: In a skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and cook the turkey sausage until just beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and continue to saute until golden brown and the turkey is cooked through, 4 to 6 additional minutes. Season with kosher salt, pepper and granulated garlic. Stir well, and then shut off the heat and set aside to cool.In a small mixing bowl, combine ricotta, egg, Parmesan, about 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and a few rounds of cracked pepper. Spread 1/4 cup of the white sauce in the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch nonreactive baking dish. Begin layering with 3 noodles, followed with about 1 cup ricotta mixture. Layer about half of the zucchini evenly over the ricotta. Follow with half the turkey sausage and mushrooms, finishing with 1 cup white sauce. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella. Repeat. Top the second layer with 4 noodles, white sauce and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella. Bake, covered with foil, for 30 minutes.Remove from the oven and remove the foil cover. Heat the broiler to maximum temperature. Broil until the cheese is browned and bubbling, about 1 minute. Garnish with the parsley.'

S'In medium skillet over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons oil and sweat onion and peppers 2 to 3 minutes then garlic and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.In a food processor, pulse together chick peas, red chili flakes, ground cumin, the egg, salt and black pepper to form a coarse consistency. Then add flour, parsley, and cilantro. Pulse until mixture starts pulling from the sides of the food processor.Remove mixture to a large bowl and mix in the onion mixture. Chill falafel until ready to cook.Roll falafel dough into 1-inch rounds. Then form rounds into an oblong quenelle shape, like a football.In a thick-bottomed skillet heat 1/2 inch of canola oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F. Cook falafel balls a few at a time, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Be sure to turn them so they do not burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt while still hot.Open the pita bread to make pockets. Place 3 to 4 falafels inside. Stuff with lettuce tomato and cucumbers and drizzle sauce generously on the inside. Serve immediately.'

S'Set a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Coat with some olive oil and add the garlic, onions, Italian seasoning and thyme. Thinly slice the Calabrese peppers and fold into the onion mixture. Season with some salt and pepper and saute until well caramelized, 7 to 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.Trim the steak of any excess fat and remove any tough silver skin with the tip of a knife. Place the steak vertically on a clean cutting board (so the grain runs up and down). Using a sharp knife, make a flat cut down one side of the piece of meat and cut it open parallel to the board so you can open the steak up like a book. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.On one side of the steak spread out the onion mixture. Top with the tomato slices, panko and shredded cheese. Tear up the basil leaves and scatter on top for the last layer of filling. Fold the flap of beef over the top to cover. Using a bamboo skewer, thread the steak along the cut edge to seal the steak back together and hold the filling in.Heat a large cast-iron skillet or grill pan (or outdoor grill) to high. Coat lightly with some oil to clean and create a nonstick surface. Sprinkle the flank steak with salt and pepper on both sides, and then place on the hot grill. Cook for 5 minutes on the first side, and then use a large spatula to carefully flip and cook for a further 5 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. (If you desire a more well done steak, cook for a few minutes longer on each side.)When done, remove from the grill and set aside to rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 1-inch-thick slices.'

S'For the tomatillos: Preheat the broiler and set the tomatillos, garlic, jalapenos and onions out on a foil-lined tray. Drizzle the ingredients with a little olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the vegetables under the broiler 3 to 4 inches from the top and cook until the tomatillos and onions are well charred, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn the vegetables and broil until charred all over, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and transfer to a blender with the chicken stock, cilantro and lime juice. Puree until completely smooth. Place in a large saute pan over medium-low heat and warm through. Season with salt and pepper.For the turkey enchiladas: Set a large saute pan over medium-high heat and coat with the oil. Add the turkey and garlic and brown well, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cumin, coriander, paprika, oregano and onions and cook until well browned, 10 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a platter and let cool.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and grease a 9-by-13-inch gratin dish with oil.Spoon some of the tomatillo sauce into the bottom of the pan to lightly coat it. Dip each tortilla into the heated tomatillo sauce (this will both flavor the tortilla and also make it more pliable). Spoon 1/4 cup of the ground turkey filling onto each tortilla. Divide 1/2 cup of the shredded Jack cheese between each tortilla. Fold the tortillas over the filling and place them seam-side down in the gratin dish. Place 6 enchiladas in the pan and top with more tomatillo sauce so they are just barely covered. Top with remaining 1/2 cup of Jack cheese and sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco. Place on a tray (to catch any drips) and bake until the cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling, 15 to 17 minutes. Finish under the broiler to brown further if desired.  Remove from the oven, let cool slightly and garnish with the chopped cilantro. Serve with the sour cream on the side.'

S'Salsa: Combine all the ingredients in a nonreactive bowl. Set aside and allow the flavors to marry.Filling: In a medium-sized saute pan over medium-high heat, add half of the olive oil.  Cook both the ground beef and turkey sausage until cooked through, then remove them from the pan to a plate. Add the remaining olive oil to the pan and saute the onion until it turns opaque, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 2 minutes longer while preventing it from burning. Return the meat mixture to the pan. Combine the ingredients well and set the filling aside.Toppings: Combine the ricotta cheese and sour cream in a small food processor or blender.  Mix well and pour it into a resealable bag.Prepare the remaining toppings and hold until you are ready to assemble the nachos.Chips: In a heavy skillet, over medium heat, heat the oil to 350 degrees F.  Carefully lower the wonton wrappers into the oil, in batches, since they cook extremely fast.  As soon as they puff up, make sure you flip them over. Once they start to brown, remove them to a plate lined with a paper towel.  Sprinkle them with salt as soon as they are out of the oil.Nachos:Preheat the oven to a low broil and position a rack approximately 9 inches below the burner.In a large oven-safe dish, arrange a layer of chips, a layer of meat mixture, (reheat if necessary), and sprinkle everything with some mozzarella. Repeat this action with the second half of the ingredients, and again finish with the cheese. Put the dish under the broiler until the cheese has melted, (keep a close eye on this).  Remove the nachos from the oven and top with the salami, fresh herbs and salsa. Take the bag holding the ricotta/sour cream mixture, and create an instant pastry tip by cutting a hole in the corner of the bag. Drizzle the sauce over your nachos, sprinkle with the green onions and pepperoncini, if using, and serve immediately.'

Add the oil and saute the garlic, carrots, celery, onions and bell peppers, about 5 minutes. Season with pepper (do not add salt at this stage or the beans will get tough while cooking). Add the red beans, kale leaves, chipotles and sauce,Worcestershire, smoked paprika, onion powder, thyme, oregano and cayenne. Stir well to combine everything, and then add the bay leaves and 8 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the bean mixture thickens, about 1 1/2 hours. Add more water as it cooks if necessary. Season well with salt once the beans are tender.When done, remove the bay leaves. Then carefully ladle out about 1 cup of the bean mixture into a food processor and puree (or mash with a fork). Return the puree to the pan, taste and season again with salt and black pepper. Add hot sauce to taste at this stage.Serve the red beans on top of steamed white rice and garnish with sliced scallions and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.'

S'For the mojo marinade: Trim the pork shoulder, removing any excess fat, and tie. Make the mojo marinade by combining the citrus juices and zest, oregano, cilantro, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the garlic and the cumin in a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the olive oil. Place the tied roast into a resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Allow to marinate for 30 to 40 minutes at room temperature. Once marinated, remove from the bag and wipe away any excess liquid. Reserve the marinade.For the pork roast: Preheat a 6-quart pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil to the pressure cooker pot and turn to high heat. Sear the roast on all sides. Then add the chicken stock, bay leaves, onions and the reserved marinade. Replace the lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the roast is tender, 30 to 45 minutes.Remove the roast, transfer to a cutting board and rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Slice thinly.For the Cuban sandwiches: Using a serrated knife, halve the Cuban loaves. Begin building the sandwiches. First, spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard onto the bread. Add 5 pickle slices, about 3 ounces of ham and a few slices of roasted pork. Top with 2 slices of the cheese. Finish with the top half of the Cuban loaf. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches.To serve: Heat a flat-top griddle pan to medium heat with the olive oil. Place the sandwiches on to the griddle pan and place a weighted cast-iron pan on top to press. Press the sandwiches until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and cut in half. Secure with bamboo skewers and serve immediately.'

S"In a food processor or blender, add the rosemary, garlic, balsamic and soy.  Pulse several times to combine, then add the black pepper and the lime juice.  Pulse, then stir in the lime zest.Trim the fat and sinew from the lamb leg.  Put it in a resealable gallon plastic bag and pour in the in the marinade.  Refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.  Strain and reserve the marinade.Preheat the oven or indirect grill to 325 degrees F.With kitchen twine, tie the leg into an evenly shaped roast.  Weave the bacon strips into the kitchen twine, along with the rosemary.  Put the lamb into a roasting pan and pour in the marinade. Roast for approximately 25 minutes per pound for medium-rare, about 1 hour 40 minutes. Internal temperature should register 145 to 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer when done. Baste occasionally with the pan juices.Remove the lamb from the oven when desired internal temperature is reached. (Chef\\'s Note: 145 degrees F for medium-rare, 160 degrees F for medium, 170 degrees F for well-done.)  Remove the lamb from pan to a cutting board and let rest lightly covered for 10 to 15 minutes.While the lamb is resting, remove the fat from the roasting pan, put it over high heat and slowly incorporate the chicken stock.  Strain and adjust seasonings, to taste.  Return to the heat and reduce for 5 minutes, then stir in the butter and vermouth.  Pour into a serving bowl. Slice the lamb and arrange it on a serving platter. Serve the sauce with the lamb."

In a medium bowl, mash the potatoes and cauliflower with the cream cheese.In a large bowl, combine the flour, spices and baking powder and mix well. Add the mashed cauliflower and potatoes and fold to combine. Add the egg into the raw potato mix, and then fold into the cauliflower and mashed potatoes. If the mixture is too thick, add a little more chicken stock.Heat a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons canola oil. When hot, add 1 cup of the mixture and gently spread out in the pan uniformly until you have a large circle (8 to 9-inches in diameter). Cook until the edges begin to brown lightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently flip over with a thin, flexible spatula and cook 2 minutes on the other side. Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter.Fill half with some Double Jack Stew and fold over.

S"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook until they just turn bright green, 2 to 3 minutes. (You don\\'t want to cook the green beans through as they will cook in the oven also.) Strain and plunge the green beans immediately in a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. When cool, drain and set out to dry on paper towels.Set a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and vegetable oil.   Once the butter is melted and the pan is hot, add the mushrooms. Cook undisturbed so the mushrooms sear nicely, about 1 minute. Add the thyme and garlic and continue cooking the mushrooms to achieve some nice color. Season with the salt, pepper, cayenne and nutmeg. Cook 2 to 3 more minutes longer, dusting the mushrooms with some of the flour as they release moisture. Stir with a whisk to incorporate the flour (just like making a roux) and gradually add in the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat and add the sour cream and cream. Stir gently and cook over low heat until gravy thickens, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the blanched green beans to the pan and fold together so everything is mixed well. Spread out evenly in the pan. Sprinkle the green beans with the grated Parmesan and transfer to a roasting tray (to catch any spill-over). Bake until the casserole is bubbly and the top is melted and golden, 15 minutes.Pour the vegetable oil into a deep skillet and heat to 350 degrees F. Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Toss the shallot rounds in the seasoned flour, then place in a strainer and shake off any excess flour. Fry the shallots in the hot oil in small batches until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and season with salt while still hot.Top the green bean casserole with the fried shallots and serve."

S"For the gnocchi: In a large stock pot over high heat, boil the potatoes, salt, smashed garlic, and roughly chopped onions until the potatoes are fork tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and return to the pot to allow the water to cook off, 5 to 10 minutes.Meanwhile, in a small saute pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add the diced onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and saute for 1 minute more. Add the spinach and cook for 3 minutes. Add the wine and cook until the spinach is wilted, 5 minutes, stirring often. Place the mixture in a strainer set over a bowl to catch the liquids as it drains off, applying pressure gently a few times to accelerate liquid removal. Reserve 1/2 cup liquid.When the potatoes are dry and slightly cooled, roughly cut them and pass through a food mill or ricer. Set aside. (Guy\\'s tip: after ricing the potatoes, spread them out on a baking sheet and allow them to dry out even more to remove moisture).In a food processor bowl fitted with the bottom blade, add the strained spinach, pulse to puree, and then add the egg and egg yolk, flour, nutmeg, and Parmesan. Pulse until well mixed. Place into a large bowl and gently fold in the riced potatoes, gently stirring until just combined. You will have very soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured board and roll into a 1 1/2-inch thick snake. Dust the dough lightly with flour and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Roll each piece gently with your thumb, leaving a small indentation on 1 side of the gnocchi. Place the finished gnocchi on a lightly floured, parchment paper-lined baking sheet. (Guy\\'s tip: if you have time, let the gnocchi rest in the refrigerator or freezer until chilled prior to cooking. It will help the gnocchi hold its shape better).Fill a large stock pot 3/4 full with water, place over high heat, add 1 tablespoon kosher salt, and bring to a rapid boil.Meanwhile, for the sauce: Wipe clean the same pan that the spinach was cooked in and place over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons butter and melt. Add the garlic and chile flakes and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Deglaze with the wine, reduce for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the stock, reserved spinach liquid, half-and-half, and cheese and reduce an additional 3 minutes. Add the pepper, tomatoes, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter.When the sauce is ready, add the gnocchi to the boiling water and cook for 3 1/2 minutes. Remove, drain, and let rest for 5 minutes. Add to the sauce and garnish with Parmesan and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Freeze any leftover gnocchi for a later meal."

S'For the brine: To a large pot, add the water and bring to a boil. Once at a boil, add the garlic, agave syrup, red chile flakes, peppercorns, and salt and turn off the heat. Once slightly cooled, add the mixture to a large container and add 6 cups ice to yield about 10 cups liquid. Add the pork and submerge. Place into the refrigerator for about 2 to 3 hours.  Remove and rinse under cool water; pat dry with paper towels.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.On a steady cutting board (place a couple of damp paper towels under it to keep it from moving around), stand the roast up with the bones up and the loin down. With a sharp, thin knife, slice carefully along the bones, separating the eye of the loin from the bones, but leaving the loin still attached on the bottom. Continue butterflying and slowly roll out, creating a large flat surface for the pesto to easily spread on.For the pesto filling: In a small bowl, combine the pesto, chile flakes, garlic, salt and pepper. Mix well and spread this mixture evenly on the inside of the rolled out loin. Carefully roll back up. Cut a 2 to 3-inch slit in between the bones. Truss the roast with kitchen string in between the bones and around the roast. This will help the roast cook evenly.For the roasting vegetables base: In a heavy, large roasting pan, add the onions, carrots, parsnips, Brussels sprouts, and smashed garlic and toss to combine. Place the tied pork roast on a v-rack over the vegetables, tent with heavy duty aluminum foil, and roast in the oven until the internal temperature reads 145 to 150 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. About 3/4 of the way through the cooking process remove the foil, this will help the pork brown up a bit. Remove from the oven, tent with foil, and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes to rest and carry over cooking for another 5 to 10 degrees F. Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat and add 1 1/2 to 2 cups chicken stock and bring to a boil. Allow to boil and reduce for 5 minutes.To finish: Strain the vegetables and place onto a serving platter. Finish the sauce with about 2 tablespoons butter and remove from the heat.Remove the kitchen string and slice the pork into 1 1/2-inch thick pieces. Serve immediately with the vegetables and pan sauce.'

S"For the enchilada sauce: Add 1 1/2 cups of hot water to a large bowl and add the dried chiles. Leave to sit so the chiles rehydrate and plump up, 15 to 20 minutes.Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and saute until fragrant and soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the cumin, and then pour in the diced tomatoes, rehydrated chile peppers and their water. Season with some salt and pepper. Then cover and simmer until sauce has reduced and is thickened, about 30 minutes. Puree with a stick blender (or in a regular blender), taking care as the liquid is hot and the air in the blender will expand. Puree until smooth and keep warm.For the taco filling: Set a large saute pan over high heat and add a drizzle of canola oil. Add the onions and bell peppers and saute until tender. Add the ground beef and saute while breaking up with the back of a wooden spoon. Cook until well browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Then season with the cumin, granulated garlic, paprika, onion powder, salt and pepper. Cook for 3 to 4 more minutes. Then stir in half the enchilada sauce (reserve the other half for assembly). Keep warm.For the tortillas: Take a large nonstick saute pan or griddle and spray lightly with the olive oil cooking spray. Warm a tortilla for about 30 seconds on both sides, and then lightly coat one side with a sprinkle of Parmesan. Warm through, and then flip so it toasts cheese side down. Allow the cheese to cook and brown, about 15 seconds, and then remove from the pan. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.To assemble: Place a tortilla, cheese side up, on a plate and top with the ground beef mixture, a slathering of the reserved enchilada sauce and garnish with some tomatoes, shredded lettuce, crema, lime and cilantro.Cook\\'s Note: When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth"

Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar starts to turn brown. Do not stir the pot. If you need to, gently swirl the pot to help melt all the sugar. Once the sugar turns a deep brown color, remove from the heat and carefully pour in the cream, taking care as it will splutter a little. Add the butter, salt and vanilla. Swirl the pot until the butter dissolves completely and evenly into the caramel sauce.Drizzle a little of the caramel sauce into 2 tall milkshake glasses.

Scoop out the flesh using a large spoon (leave enough on the base so the skin holds its shape) and reserve bases.Add the potato flesh, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cayenne pepper and butter to a food processor. Process until the ingredients are completely combined and the puree is smooth.  Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle a roasting tray with a little oil. Set the potato skin bases upright on the tray and fill with the mixture.Combine the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and pecans in a small bowl. Sprinkle the top of each stuffed sweet potato with the sugar-pecan topping. Bake 10 minutes. Finish the potatoes under the broiler for the top to brown, 1 minute, if desired.'

Squeeze out the cabbage with your hands or tongs to force the salt into the cabbage and this will start drawing out the water immediately (this is what gives the pickled cabbage its distinctive crunch when finished). Leave to sit in a colander for 30 minutes.In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice vinegar, sambal, sugar, toasted sesame oil, garlic, ginger and season with salt and pepper. Whisk together well. Add the carrots, daikon and scallions.Rinse the cabbage under cold running water and firmly squeeze out excess liquid. Add the cabbage to the bowl with the other ingredients and mix well.You can choose to serve this immediately OR if you prefer, you can pack it into a 1-gallon jar, seal, wrap in plastic and leave to sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours before serving.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Make the chicken marinade by combining the granulated garlic, sugar, paprika, dry mustard, cayenne and some salt and pepper together. Mix well then place the chicken thighs into a resealable plastic bag and pour the dry seasoning over. Seal the bag and shake it around so the chicken is seasoned evenly.Transfer the chicken to a roasting pan. Pour over the 2 tablespoons of the chicken stock, the wine, Worcestershire and liquid smoke. Cover tightly with foil then place in the oven and roast for 30 minutes.Uncover the foil and continue to cook to roast the chicken, another 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and place on the stovetop. Remove the chicken to a plate and turn the burners on to medium heat.Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and canola oil and cook until brown and the fat has rendered slightly, 7 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and set aside. Add the garlic, celery, onions, peppers and potatoes to the Dutch oven and cook in the bacon fat until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, add the reserved chicken to the Dutch oven. Cook to add a little color, 2 to 3 minutes, then pour in any juices from the roasting pan into the Dutch oven. Use a little water to get any roasted brown bits from the bottom of the pan off. Return the bacon to the Dutch oven, add the tomatoes and their juices and pour in the remaining chicken stock. Stir well, and then simmer for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add the BBQ sauce, corn, pinto beans and lima beans to the stew. Stir well and simmer until the chicken is very tender, the vegetables are soft and the beans are heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.When done, stir well and taste. Season with salt, pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce. Serve with cornbread and slaw.'

S'Prep-Ahead Tip: Mise en place everything ahead of time on this one-chop everything, roast the poblanos, and cook the bacon. The dressing can be made 1 or 2 days ahead and stored in the fridge. But cooking and shucking the corn is best left to the last minute, as the corn will stay nice and bright and juicy.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Set a turkey roaster pan over 2 burners on medium heat and add the canola oil. Brown the chicken, skin-side down first, 3 to 4 minutes, then turn and brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove from the pan and set aside.Add a little more of the oil to the pan on high heat and add the mushrooms, garlic and onions. Season with salt and cook just long enough to get some color on the mushrooms, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and thyme and cook about 1 minute longer. Place the chicken pieces back into the pan skin-side up and spread them out evenly, pushing them down into the mushrooms and onions. Add the marsala, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan, and add the chicken broth. Place the whole pan in the oven and cook until the tops of the chicken are golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.Use tongs to remove the chicken from the pan and transfer onto a serving platter and keep warm. Set the roasting pan back over the burner on high heat. Bring the contents to a boil and cook the liquid until it is reduced and the flavors become concentrated, 3 to 4 minutes. Shut off the heat, add the butter cubes and stir gently to melt the butter evenly. This will thicken the marsala sauce and give it a rich flavor. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add a squeeze of the lemon juice and fold in the parsley. Pour over the chicken and serve with Chardonnay.'

S"Combine the coffee and amaretto liqueur in a bowl or shallow baking dish and set aside.Bring a small saucepan with 2 inches of water to a boil over high heat. In a small heatproof bowl that will fit on top of the saucepan, or in a double boiler, combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the whipping cream. Place over the hot water and whisk continuously until the mixture is 160 degrees F and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk for 3 to 4 minutes to cool. Set aside to cool completely, approximately 10 to 15 minutes.In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, add the remaining whipping cream, prepared yolk mixture, and sugar and beat until soft peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the mascarpone and combine well.Place 1 layer of the ladyfingers in a 9 by 13-inch pan; most pans this size fit them in 6 rows of 3. Then, dip both sides of the ladyfingers quickly into the coffee mixture and place back into the pan. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the cookies, sprinkle with half of the cocoa powder. Repeat with another layer. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours.Shave the chocolate over the top for garnish and cut with a sharp thin knife into squares. Serve immediately.Guy\\'s Tip: A French press with dark roasted coffee works well for the strongly brewed coffee."

Whisk to combine, then cover and refrigerate.For the lobster: In a large pot, add 3 inches cold water, the white wine, crab boil seasoning, peppercorns, salt, garlic and lemons. Bring to a boil then drop in the lobster tails and poach until the shells turn bright red and the flesh is just cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the tails from the cooking liquid and cool slightly before picking the meat from the shells.For the hushpuppies: Place half of the lobster meat and the buttermilk in the pitcher of a blender and puree until smooth. Roughly chop the remaining lobster meat and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, red peppers, baking powder, black pepper, jalapenos and 2 teaspoons salt. Stir in the scallions, eggs and the lobster-buttermilk mixture, and then fold in the chopped lobster tails.

Heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F.Working in batches, place heaping tablespoons of the batter into the hot oil. Use two spoons or a 2-tablespoon scoop to form the dumplings and drop into the oil. Fry the hushpuppies, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the hushpuppies from the oil and place on a paper-towel-lined plate. Season with salt and squeeze lemon juice over the top.Serve the crispy hushpuppies with the chilled horseradish cream.'

S'Begin by making the brine: In a large bowl, combine 6 cups water, the salt, honey, garlic and ginger. Stir until the salt is dissolved, and then add the wings. Cover and leave in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Prepare the quick pickle mixture: In a large bowl, combine the rice wine vinegar, sugar and soy sauce. Stir well until the sugar dissolves. Add the dates, scallions and chile to the mixture. Set aside while you cook the wings.Once the wings have brined, drain and set out on kitchen towels to dry well.Prepare an outdoor grill with zones for direct and indirect heat. Wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted paper towel. This not only cleans the grill but creates a nonstick surface.Sprinkle the wings with salt and pepper, and then lightly toss in a mixture of smoked paprika and sesame oil. Place the wings on the direct heat side of the grill and cook, turning until the wings are golden brown and the skin is crispy, 7 to 8 minutes. Move the wings to the indirect side to finish cooking, 12 to 15 minutes more. When done, remove the wings to a large bowl. Add the chopped herbs to the pickled date mixture, toss to combine and add to the bowl with the wings. Toss to coat evenly, and then transfer to a serving platter and serve.'

S'For the tenderloin: Begin by placing a large sheet of plastic wrap on a clean bench top (use 2 overlapping sheets if you have to). In the center of the plastic, lay the bacon slices vertically, slightly overlapping one another, working from left to right. Sprinkle the tenderloin with the salt and pepper. Place the beef tenderloin horizontally across the strips of bacon (along the bottom of the rectangle of bacon). Roll up the plastic and bacon around the beef so it is wrapped tightly and evenly. Twist the ends of plastic to tighten and form the meat into an even log shape. Place in the refrigerator to firm up for 1 hour so the bacon sticks to the beef and the roast retains its nice even shape.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Set a large cast-iron pan (or roaster) over high heat and coat lightly with canola oil. Remove the beef from the fridge and discard the plastic. Place the roast seam-side down in the pan and brown on all four sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. When completely browned, place the whole pan in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes (an instant-read thermometer should register 135 degrees F for medium-rare). When done, remove from the oven and transfer the roast to a platter to rest before slicing into 1/2-inch-thick slices.For the peppercorn sauce: Set the pan used for the beef over medium heat. Discard all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of fat from the pan, and then add the garlic and shallots. Season with some salt and saute until caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the green peppercorns. Mix well, and then remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the whiskey (you can flambe if you like here by igniting the alcohol in the pan). Return the pan to the heat and cook down until just about all the liquid has reduced before adding the beef stock and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer and cook to allow flavors to meld, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the cold butter cubes, swirling as they dissolve. Taste and, if needed, season with more salt. Serve with the slices of bacon wrapped tenderloin.'

S'In a large Dutch oven or countertop fryer using a high heat thermometer, bring the canola oil to 375 degrees F.For the chocolate sauce: Bring a double broiler to a simmer over medium-low heat. Carefully melt the chocolate. Remove from the heat. With a wooden spoon or heat resistant spatula, stir in the heavy cream until the sauce is smooth. Set aside.For the churros: Set a large saucepot over medium heat. Add 1 cup water, the butter, sugar and salt. Bring to 155 degrees F, then dump in the flour and stir with a wooden spoon to incorporate and remove lumps, about 1 minute.Using the spoon, add the eggs into the batter one at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. Spoon the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and carefully pipe into the heated oil, forming 6-inch strips or free form shapes. Do not overcrowd the pot. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes, turning once as the underside browns. Remove with a spider or slotted spoon and drain on paper-towel-lined sheet tray or plate.To finish: Working quickly, combine the sugar and cinnamon together in a large mixing bowl. Gently add the hot churros, tossing to coat. Serve with the chocolate dipping sauce.'

S'In a medium saucepan, add the butter and set over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt, and then sprinkle with the flour and stir with a whisk. Cook over low heat until the butter and flour combine into a mixture like wet sand. Once combined, stir for 1 to 2 minutes to cook the flour (but without adding color). Pour in the milk slowly as you whisk to combine. Continue stirring until the mixture thickens up, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the salt, nutmeg and cheese and stir until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth. Set aside and keep warm until ready to use. Yield: 1 cup.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the chicken: Using kitchen shears, remove the backbone of the chicken and set aside. Cut the chicken in half, straight through the breastbone. By separating the chicken into two pieces it will ensure that the chicken gets smoked more thoroughly. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, the granulated garlic and smoked paprika.Place 1 deep aluminum roasting pan over the stove top. Line with aluminum foil. Add the soaked wood chips to a large piece of foil, and then fold in the sides to make a pouch. Punch holes in the top of the pouch, set it directly over a gas burner and turn on high. Leave for 2 to 3 minutes, watching carefully. Once it begins to smoke, using tongs, transfer the pouch to the bottom of the lined roasting pan. Set a wire rack over the chips in the lined roasting pan and position it so the wood chips are directly over the burner and continue to smoke. Place the chicken pieces bone-side down on the rack. Cover tightly with aluminum foil to seal in the smoke. Put the roasting pan into the oven and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove and cool. Shred the smoked chicken breast.'

S'For the chicken and marinade: Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Combine the yogurt with the paprika, coriander, cumin, cayenne, lemon zest, cinnamon, garlic and ginger in a mixing bowl. Mix together well then pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken pieces and shake around to coat all the pieces evenly. Place in the refrigerator and marinate for 1 hour.Heat a grill to high. Wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted paper towel to create a nonstick surface. Remove the chicken from the marinade and wipe off any excess. Grill the chicken pieces until well-marked, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and set aside.For the sauce: Set a Dutch oven over medium heat. (Alternatively, you can cook in a pressure cooker. Simply cut the cooking time in half and cook over medium heat with medium pressure.) Coat with the  oil and add the butter. Add the garlic and onions. Cook until translucent and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste, paprika and garam masala. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to toast the spices and cook the tomato paste. Add the crushed tomatoes, vinegar and grilled chicken pieces. Stir well and simmer until the chicken is tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Finish the sauce with the heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with the cilantro.Wine paring for meal: dry Riesling or sparkling wine'

S'For the chile stuffing: Preheat a grill to high heat (you can also use a broiler if you don\\\'t have a grill). Place the whole chiles on the grill and cook until well charred and blistered, turning every 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cover with plastic wrap so they "sweat," making them easier to peel. Let the chiles stand for 5 minutes before uncovering and using towels to rub off the skins. Discard the skins, remove the cores and seeds and finely chop the chiles. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the cheeses and stir together to form a stuffing. Set aside until ready to use.For the turkey cordon bleu: Make a horizontal cut down the length of the thin side of each turkey breast using a sharp thin knife. Open the breasts up like a book so the cut-sides are exposed facing up and the skin-side is down, with the "spine" of the chicken horizontal on your work surface. Sprinkle the turkey with salt and pepper.Lay 5 slices of the deli ham on each breast and trim the edges so the ham fits inside the breast and there is a small border around the turkey. Leaving this gap will ensure that when the turkey is rolled up it forms a nice seal and the stuffing doesn\\\'t ooze out everywhere. Divide the poblano-cheese stuffing in thirds and spread on each of the breasts evenly, leaving a small border around the edge. Starting from one side, tightly roll up the turkey away from you, stuffing in any of the filling as it tries to escape at the edges (it is important you roll it up this way, so when you make the slices in the finished roulade they are across the grain). Secure the roll with pieces of butchers twine every 2 inches to form a tight, even log. Repeat with the remaining breasts. Sprinkle the outsides with salt and pepper.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat oil in a turkey roaster set across two burners on medium-high heat. Add the roulades and brown evenly, 3 to 4 minutes per side. When browned all over, transfer the whole pan of the roulades to the oven and finish cooking. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes.Transfer to a platter and allow the meat to rest to allow for carry-over cooking and the internal temperature to reach 170 degrees F, 10 to 12 minutes. To serve, remove the twine  and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drizzle the pan juices over the top.Cook\\\'s Note: The turkey pairs well with a dry Riesling.'

S'Special equipment: a deep-fry thermometerFor the fries: Wash and scrub the potatoes. Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch slices, and then slice into 1/4-inch sticks. Fill a large bowl with water and the vinegar and soak the potatoes for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.For the chorizo poutine: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted, add the garlic, onions, carrot, celery and 1 teaspoon salt and saute until the onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the chorizo and saute, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until well browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the flour and stir well, cooking the mixture until the flour is completely incorporated. Deglaze with the beef stock, then add the hot sauce, Worcestershire and dry mustard and stir well until combined. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer, cooking until the sauce thickens, 30 to 35 minutes. Season with salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, keep warm and set aside.Cook the fries: Preheat 3 to 4 inches of canola oil in a Dutch oven to 300 degrees F. Working in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pot, add handfuls of potatoes to the oil. Blanch the potatoes until just lightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the potatoes, shake off excess oil and let drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Allow to cool. Once all the fried have been blanched, raise the temperature of the oil to 350 degrees F.  Working in batches again, cook the fries until golden brown and very crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the fries from the oil, drain and season with salt.To serve, place half of the fries on a large serving platter. Sprinkle the cheese curds over the top, and spoon the hot chorizo gravy over the fries. Repeat with a second layer of each, finishing with a garnish of sliced scallions.'

S'For the brine: Combine the chicken pieces, salt, hot sauce, liquid smoke and black pepper with 4 cups water in a large resealable bag and place inside a container (in case of leaks). Refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Drain and discard the brine.For the stock: If you have the time, allow the chicken to drain and dry out about 30 minutes prior to searing. It will create a better crust on the chicken and more brown bits on the bottom of the pot, ultimately adding more flavor to the gumbo.Sprinkle the chicken pieces, including the reserved neck, back and wing tips, with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven (enameled cast iron preferred), heat the oil over high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken pieces and brown well on all sides, turning as needed. Add the celery, carrots, onions and jalapenos, and continue to brown for an additional 10 minutes. Add 1 gallon water and the liquid smoke and bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to maintain a strong simmer. Cook for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.After 1 1/2 hours, remove the chicken pieces, discarding the back, neck and wing tips. Strain the stock and reserve. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat and shred, discarding the bones and fat.For the gumbo: In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the sausages and cook until the fat has rendered down, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausages from the pan and set aside. Add the bacon fat and, when shimmering, add the onions, celery, bell peppers and Anaheim peppers. Saute, stirring frequently, until the onions are just starting to color, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes more, being careful not to let it burn. Add the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, stirring constantly. Stir until a dark golden roux has developed, 11 to 13 minutes. Add 1 cup at a time of the stock, incorporating well after each addition, to total 6 cups.Add the reserved sausages, shredded chicken, cayenne and white pepper into the pot. Heat through and add the salt and black pepper. If the gumbo is too thick, add a bit more stock to the pot, a little at a time, until the desired consistency is reached.Serve over rice and garnish with parsley.'

S'Heat the oil in a large, deep saute pan or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until browned and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, the green and red peppers and the garlic and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, or until the peppers are wilted and lightly browned. Add the beer, chicken stock, thyme, bay leaf and rosemary and deglaze the pan. Prick holes in the brats with a fork or skewer to prevent them from bursting during cooking. Add the brats to the pan, reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15 to 17 minutes, turning the brats halfway through.Preheat a grill or cast-iron griddle to medium-high heat.Remove the brats from the pot; let the braising liquid continue to simmer and reduce. Pat the brats dry with paper towels, then score them diagonally, making 3 or 4 shallow incisions on either side (this will ensure plenty of crispy edges when grilled). Brush the grill lightly with oil and grill the brats for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until well-marked.When the braising liquid has reduced to the consistency of a sauce, remove it from the heat and stir in the mustard and butter. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.To serve, spoon some of the braising sauce, along with the peppers and onions, onto a platter. Set the grilled brats on top and drizzle with the remaining sauce. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve.'

S"Combine the smoked paprika, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, five spice powder, dry mustard and some salt and pepper in a bowl. Using a sharp knife, score the skin of the duck so it has a 1/4-inch diamond pattern. Rub the spice mixture all over the duck.Heat a grill to medium (make sure it\\'s not too hot since the key is to cook duck slowly to render the fat) and wipe down the grates with an oiled towel.   Place the duck skin-side down on the grate and cook until the skin is seared and the fat is rendered, 4 to 5 minutes.  (If there are occasional flare-ups from the fat, move the duck around on the grill to a new spot away from the flame each time.) Flip the duck over and place on a cooler part of the grill. Cook for an additional 5 minutes for medium-rare. Let rest for 5 to 7 minutes before cutting against the grain into thick slices."

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S'Put the vegetable oil, tequila, lime juice, chipotle pepper, cumin, chili powder, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper in a small food processor or blender and blend until smooth. Put the marinade in a plastic bag along with the chicken. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours.Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Add the jalapeno and grill until the skin is well charred. Remove the jalapeno to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap to sweat the skin. When cool enough to handle, remove the stem, skin, and seeds, then finely mince.Heat a large, heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Once hot, add the onion and saute until starting to caramelize, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, minced jalapeno, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper, to taste. Cook about 3 or 4 minutes, being careful not to burn the mixture. Deglaze the pan with some of the chicken stock, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.Add the remaining chicken stock, the crushed tomatoes and the lime juice. Add the tortilla strips and bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.While soup base is simmering, heat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and put on grill. Grill, turning until cooked through, about 14 to 18 minutes. Remove from the grill, to a large plate and when cool enough to handle, remove the skin and bones and shred. Keep warm.For serving:Heat the vegetable oil in a tall sided skillet to 350 degrees F. Add the tortilla strips and fry until they are golden brown. Remove to a paper towel lined plate and season with 1 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of chili powder.Combine the sour cream, 2 tablespoons tequila, and the remaining lime zest in a small bowl and season with salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper.To serve, put some of the shredded chicken in the bottom of each bowl and pour in the hot soup base. Top with diced avocado, fried tortilla strips, the tequila crema, and cilantro. Garnish with lime wedges and serve.'

S'Prepare the sloppy joes: In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, combine the canola oil, bell peppers, jalapeno and onion; cook for 5 minutes. Add the beef and pork; cook thoroughly, breaking up the meat as it browns. Add the garlic. Depending on the amount of residual grease, you may need to drain some of the fat from the pan. Deglaze with the red wine, then stir in the remaining sloppy joe ingredients (except the rolls) and season with 1 tablespoon each salt and freshly ground pepper. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. If the sauce gets too thick as it simmers, add up to 1 cup water to adjust the consistency. Toast the rolls and set aside.Meanwhile, prepare the onion straws: In a medium sauce pot, heat the oil to 350 degrees. Whisk the egg and milk in a medium bowl. Mix the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper in another medium bowl. Cut the onion in half, then slice into 1-inch-thick half rings; separate into short straw-like pieces. Add to the milk mixture to soak.Once the oil is hot enough, remove the onions from the milk mixture, shake off excess and dredge in the flour mixture, 4 or 5 pieces at a time. Add to the pot and fry until golden brown; transfer to paper towels to drain.Serve the sloppy joes on the toasted rolls and top with onion straws.Photograph by James Baigrie'

S'In a nonmetallic bowl, combine 3/4 cup red wine, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons pepper and 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce. Add the rib-eye steak and let marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.Cook the bacon in a large saute pan over medium-low heat to slowly render the fat. When crisp, remove to a paper towel lined plate, reserving the fat in the pan.Remove the beef from the marinade, pat dry and add to the pan with the bacon fat. Cook over medium-high heat, browning the meat on all sides. Remove the meat from the pan, to a plate. Add extra oil, if necessary, to amount to 2 to 3 tablespoons of total fat in the pan. Add the carrots, parsnips, and the frozen onions. Cook until the onions are light brown, approximately 10 minutes.Add the flour to the vegetable mixture to make a roux. When the roux begins to brown, add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Deglaze with the remaining red wine and stir in the beef broth. Reduce over medium heat for 10 minutes. Add the browned beef, cooked bacon, thyme, parsley and oregano. Adjust seasonings, to taste, with remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and fresh cracked pepper. Transfer to a serving dish, garnish with Parmesan and fried onions and serve immediately.'

Refrigerate for 1 hour.For the dry rub: Combine the ancho chile powder, granulated garlic, salt, cumin, onion powder, cinnamon and black pepper together and toast in a dry pan until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry. Sprinkle the chicken on all sides with the dry rub, massaging the spices into the meat and ensuring that all sides are completely coated. Return to the refrigerator and marinate for 1 hour.For the mole sauce: In a medium saute pan over medium heat, add the canola oil and onions and cook until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the tomatoes, chocolate, almonds, cinnamon, cumin, ancho chiles and chipotles with their liquid and simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a food processor, add in the chicken stock and puree until smooth. Add the currants and process again.

S'Toast the coriander and the cumin in a saute pan over medium heat until the spices become fragrant and just begin to smoke, 2 minutes. Set the spices aside to cool and then blend them in a spice grinder.Combine the yogurt, lime, cumin, coriander, paprika, ginger, cinnamon, turmeric, cayenne, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.Poke the lamb several times with a fork and place in a large resealable plastic bag with the garlic and the onions and pour in the yogurt mixture. Move the lamb around in the bag to coat completely and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 4 to 6 hours.Remove the lamb and the onions from the marinade and let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Discard the marinade. Heat the grill to high, sear all sides of the lamb and adjust grill to indirect heat, about 350 degrees F. Grill the lamb for about 45 minutes per side for medium. When the lamb is cooked, remove it to a platter to rest for 15 minutes before cutting. Add the onions and the lime halves to the grill and cook until caramelized and tender, about 10 minutes.

S"These soft pretzels are a more artisanal departure from the pretzels we are used to getting at ballparks and from street vendors. Guy uses whole wheat flour which gives these pretzels a more dense and chewy texture, so if you\\'re looking for a less dense pretzel, try substituting the whole wheat flour with all-purpose flour.When it comes time to rest and proof your pretzels don\\'t be afraid to let them sit a little longer so they are puffier; depending on the time of year, the temperature in your kitchen may vary."
