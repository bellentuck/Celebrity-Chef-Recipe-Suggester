S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a piece of aluminum foil on the bottom rack to catch any drippings. Butter a 9 by 9-inch glass baking dish and set aside.Place the flour, 1-ounce sugar, lime zest, and 1 teaspoon salt into the bowl of a food processor and pulse 3 to 4 times. Add the butter and lard and pulse until the mixture just becomes crumbly. Sprinkle or spritz the mixture with the ice water a little at a time and process just until the dough holds together when squeezed in a fist. Place the dough into a 1 gallon zip top bag and form into a disk. Place the dough into the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, while you prepare the filling.In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the 1 cup of sugar, cornstarch, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Stir in the rhubarb, peaches, and lime juice.Remove 1/3 of the dough from the bag, pinch into pieces and distribute evenly in the bottom of the prepared dish. With the remaining dough still in the bag, roll it out to a sheet large enough to cover the top of the dish. Pour the fruit mixture into the dish and top with the dough that has been removed from the bag, pressing the dough into the corners of the dish. Bake, uncovered, for 60 minutes or until the dough is cooked through and starting to turn golden. *If using frozen fruit, increase cooking time to 90 minutes. Change the oven setting to broil and continue to cook until golden brown, approximately 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to stand for 15 to 30 minutes before serving.'

Carefully set 22 to 23 coals on the lid and leave only 18 to 19 coals under the grate. If you have more coals than this, remove them from the grill or push them to the edges so they are not directly under the Dutch oven. Set the Dutch oven on the grate, 2 inches above and directly over the coals. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.

Once you remove the backbone you will be able to see the inside of the bird. Make a small slit in the cartilage at the base of the breastbone to reveal the keel bone. Grab the bird with both hands on the ribs and open up like a book, facing down towards the cutting board. Remove the keel bone. Cut small slits in the skin of the bird behind the legs and tuck the drumsticks into them in order to hold them in place. Season on both sides with salt and pepper.Spray the bottom of the panini press with the nonstick cooking spray. Place the bird, skin side up onto the press, pray the skin side with non-stick cooking spray and close the lid. Top the press with a 10-pound weight and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until the skin is golden brown. Allow to rest 3 minutes before serving.'

(Weigh the greens after stemming, but before washing.)Once the turkey legs have simmered for 10 minutes, add the greens, salt and sugar, reduce the heat to low, cover, and allow to simmer gently for 45 minutes or until the greens are tender. Move the greens around every 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and season with additional salt, if desired. Serve immediately.'

S"Combine the sugar, water, and corn syrup in a small, heavy saucepan and place over high heat. As soon as the sugar has dissolved, heat your thermometer under warm tap water (to prevent thermal shock) and attach to side of pan, making sure that the bulb is completely submerged. Do not stir the mixture or agitate the pan at this stage. When the mixture reaches 230 degrees, reduce the heat to medium and allow the sugar to color gradually. As the temperature approaches 300 degrees the color will start to turn to amber. At this point, it\\'s safe to swirl the pan gently to help distribute the heat evenly. As the caramel heads towards 340 degrees, it will reach a deep amber color. Remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir with a metal spoon, allowing it to cool until the caramel falls from the spoon in a solid stream, like a string. When it does, it\\'s doodad time.Form doodads by holding the spoon 12 to 16 inches over the caramel and drizzling the patterns on the parchment. (Hint: allow the spoon to unload into the pan for a few seconds before attempting doodad. This will allow a narrower stream.)  Quick back and forth motions or side to side movements are best. It\\'s all in the wrist. Allow doodads to cool for 15 minutes then peel the paper off  (not the other way around). Stack in an airtight container with wax paper between each piece. After making 15 to 20 doodads, you should have sufficient caramel remaining to move on to the sauce phase. So, return the remaining caramel to medium high heat and continue cooking until you see the first sign of smoke. Immediately remove from the heat, and add the cream, all at once, at arms length. (It will boil furiously.) Once the mixture calms down, return to medium heat and boil 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool to room temperature, move to squirt bottle and refrigerate for up to a week. To make the bananas brulee, quarter the bananas (peel on) and rub into sugar to coat thoroughly. Remove peel and place on cooling rack over several layers of foil. (Don\\'t try this on your dining room table.) Don your safety goggles and fire up your torch. Hold the torch so that the very tip of the flame barely touches the banana, and move quickly back and forth until the sugar melts, turns brown, and bubbles. As soon as it looks like caramel, move on. You know you\\'ve got it down when a solid, glasslike sheet of gold (no graininess) has formed on the banana.To do the split (so to speak), squirt a pattern of caramel sauce on a chilled plate, top with 4 banana pieces (Lincoln log style), top with the ice cream of your choice (we like our peachy vanilla from Churn Baby Churn), and finally, a doodad."

S'Rub inside of fondue pot or heavy small saucepan with garlic.  Pour cider into pot. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, the brandy and salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, grate the cheese and toss well with the cornstarch in a large bowl. When the cider just begins to simmer, gradually add the cheese a handful at a time, allowing each addition to melt completely before adding the next. Continue adding cheese and stirring until all cheese is incorporated, about 3 minutes. If mixture starts to bubble, reduce heat to low.  The mixture is ready when creamy and easily coats the back of a spoon. Stir in curry powder and pepper.  If cheese seems stringy, add some or all of the remaining lemon juice.  Move fondue pot to alcohol warmer, and keep stirring during service.  A variety of breads, from pumpernickel to rye to bagel chunks can be skewered and dipped as can cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms and potatoes. (Soften all vegetables by blanching briefly in boiling water then chilling.) Crisp fruits such as apples make great fondue fodder, as do cooked meats and sausages. Even soft pretzels make for good dipping.   If any fondue is left over, cover with ice water and refrigerate, pour off water and reheat over low heat.'

As soon as curds begin to form, increase heat to high and instead of stirring, use the spatula to fold the eggs over themselves while gently shaking the pan with your other hand. As soon as no more liquid is running around the bottom of the pan, remove from the heat and serve. Season with fresh black pepper and garnish with fresh chives or parsley.

Using a sharp pizza cutter (and tracing a small plate) cut out 2 circles of pastry. Place pastry circles on a chilled sheet pan and let cool in the refrigerator for a few minutes.Using a vegetable peeler cut wafer thin apple slices. Put apple slices in lemon-juice-spiked water.Flip pastry circles over on the sheet pans and poke them with a fork to provide an outlet for steam. Put parchment paper on the pan underneath the pastry circles. Sprinkle pastry with sugar and arrange apple slices on top.Bake in the middle of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Poke the crust; if it feels soft it needs more time in the oven.Microwave some apricot jam for 30 seconds. Dab (don\\'t brush) the jam on the tarts. Cool tarts at least 4 hours and seal in a resealable plastic bag.

S'Place chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, oregano, salt, black pepper and turkey legs into a 6-quart pot and add enough water to completely cover the meat, approximately 2 1/2 quarts. Cover, place over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the meat is very tender and falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove the meat from the water to a cutting board, and set aside to cool. Leave the cooking liquid in the pot. Once the turkey legs are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bone and shred, discarding any skin or cartilage. Place a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Once shimmering, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are semi-translucent, approximately 2 minutes. Add the garlic and chili and continue to cook for another minute. Add the meat and 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking liquid and cook until heated through and the liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside until ready to assemble.For the wrappers:While the meat is cooking, place the husks in a large bowl or container and submerge completely in hot water. Soak the husks until they are soft and pliable, at least 45 minutes and up to 2 hours. If you have an electric kettle, place the husks in the kettle, fill with water and turn on. Once the kettle turns off, allow the husks to sit for 1 hour in the hot water.For the dough:Place the masa, salt, and baking powder into a large mixing bowl and combine. Add the lard and using your hands, knead together until the lard is well incorporated into the dry mixture. Gradually add enough of the reserved cooking liquid, 2 to 4 cups to create a dough that is like thick mashed potatoes. The dough should be moist but not wet. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and set aside until ready to use.To assemble the tamales:Remove a corn husk from the water and pat to remove excess water. Working in batches of 6, lay the husks on a towel and spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough in an even layer across the wide end of the husk to within 1/2-inch of the edges. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the meat mixture in a line down the center of the dough. Roll the husk so the dough surrounds the meat and fold the bottom under to finish creating the tamale. Repeat until all the husks, dough and filling are used. Tie the tamales, around the center, individually or in groups of 3, with kitchen twine.To steam the tamales:Place a steamer basket in the bottom of an 11-quart pot and add enough water to come to the bottom of the basket. Stand the tamales close together on their folded ends and lean them in towards the center, away from the sides of the pot.  Bring the water to a boil over medium heat, then cover and reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Check the water level every 15 to 20 minutes, and add boiling water by pouring down the side of the pot, if necessary. Steam until the dough is firm and pulls away from the husk easily, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.Serve warm. Store leftover tamales, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, in the freezer, for up to a month. To reheat, remove the plastic wrap and steam until heated through.'

S"Heat oven to 400 degrees and butter a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and set aside.Using a mandolin, V-slicer or the slicing attachment on a food processor, slice the potatoes approximately 1/8-inch thick. (If you don\\'t want to slice all the potatoes at once, slice them one at a time and build the gratin as you go.)  Create the first layer by laying the slices in overlapping rows. Once the first layer is down, season lightly with salt and pepper, then scatter with mushroom slices and a couple tablespoons of the cheese. (Don\\'t over-do it on these layers, if you create a barrier between the adjoining potato layers, the gratin won\\'t set.) Continue building layers until you\\'re out of potatoes or out of room to build, but be sure to save 1/2 cup of the cheese for the top.Pour 2/3 cup of the half and half over the gratin then spread both hands over the surface and push down to work the air out from the layers. Add remaining liquid only if half and half does not come to the surface when you push down. Sprinkle the gratin with cheese, cover loosely with foil and place in middle of oven for 1 hour. Check for doneness by inserting the point of a paring knife straight into the gratin. If it goes through smoothly, remove the foil, return to oven, and turn on the broiler just long enough to turn the top golden-brown. Remove, and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving."

S'In a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, bring the heavy cream and oyster liquor from the oysters to a simmer. Remove from the heat.Meanwhile, in a large saute pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the celery and a pinch of the salt and sweat for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onion and continue cooking until translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add celery seed, hot pepper sauce, and oysters and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the edges of the oysters start to curl. Transfer the oysters to the carafe of a blender and add enough of the cream just to cover.* Puree until the mixture is smooth. Return the remaining cream to medium heat, add the pureed mixture, and cook until heated through.Just before serving, add the lemon juice, chopped herbs, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.'

The topping should come a few millimeters up the side of the custard cup.Separate 3 of the eggs using the slotted spoon.  Reserve the whites. (Note: Freeze the whites in ice trays.  After the whites are frozen, place the frozen cubes into zip-top freezer bags.  The frozen whites can be frozen up to a year.)Place a mixing bowl on a rubber pad or a wet towel to prevent the bowl from spinning out of control.  In a mixing bowl, combine the remaining whole eggs and the yolks.  Whip the eggs with a whisk until slightly thickened and lightened in color. While whisking the eggs, drizzle in about a quarter of the hot milk.  Now whisk the tempered eggs back into the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture.Place a fine mesh strainer over a glass or stainless steel bowl with a spout.  Pour the egg mixture through the strainer in order to catch any curdled egg bits or particles that may be in the mixture.Place the custard cups into the roasting pan.  Evenly distribute the custard into the custard cups, going short on the first pass.  Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and pour boiling water into the pan just under the level of the custard.Cook the flans for about 40 minutes, or until they wobble slightly when the pan is wiggled, about 40 minutes.  You can also insert a paring knife midway between the edge and the center.  If it comes out clean, the flans are done.  Using tongs, remove the cups from the pan to a towel-lined sheet pan.  Allow the water in the roasting pan to cool before discarding. Cool, cover and chill.'

S"Cook\\'s Note: To open a coconut: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the coconut onto a folded towel set down in a large bowl. Find the 3 eyes on 1 end of the coconut and using a nail or screwdriver and hammer or meat mallet, hammer holes into 2 of the eyes. Turn the coconut upside down over a container and drain the water from the coconut. Store the water in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Place the coconut onto a 1/2 sheet pan and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. The coconut should have cracked in several places. Using an oyster knife or other dull blade, separate the hard shell from the brown husk. Using a serrated vegetable peeler, peel the brown husk from the coconut meat. Rinse the coconut meat under cool water and pat dry. Break the meat into 2 to 3-inch pieces. With the grater disk attached to a food processor, grate the coconut. Place 1 1/2 ounces of the coconut into a 1-cup glass jar with lid and pour the vodka over it. Seal and shake to combine. Place in a cool dark place for 5 to 7 days, shaking to combine every day. Strain the coconut and discard. Return the vodka to a clean jar or to its original bottle and store in a cool place for up to a year. Reserve the remaining coconut for another use."

S'Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper.Combine the sugar, water, corn syrup, and cream of tartar in a heavy 4-quart saucepan and put over high heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar has dissolved.  Cover and continue to cook for 5 minutes.Meanwhile, combine the heavy cream and soy sauce in a liquid measuring cup. Have this and the butter standing by.Remove the lid from the sugar mixture, and attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan.  When the sugar mixture reaches 230 degrees F, reduce the heat to medium and cook, without stirring, until the syrup is a golden color and is approaching 300 degrees F, about 6 to 7 minutes. At this point, there is less likelihood of any crystallization, so gently swirl the pan to break up any hot pockets.When the temperature approaches 350 degrees F, it will turn deep amber. Remove the pan from the heat, and gently swirl again to break up all of the hot pockets. Cool for 2 minutes.Carefully incorporate the cream and soy mixture and the butter into the pan. Stir to combine.  Return the caramel to medium heat, stir until the butter is completely melted, and continue cooking until it reaches 255 degrees F.  Remove from the heat and pour into the parchment-lined pan, tap gently to release air bubbles.Cool on a cooling rack for 30 minutes, and then sprinkle evenly with the salt.  Continue cooling on the rack for an additional 3 1/2 hours.  Cut into 1-inch pieces and wrap individually in parchment. Store in an airtight container for up to a week.'

S"In a bowl combine all the dry ingredients and diced butter.  Rub mixture briskly between finger tips until it forms small moist clumps in a loose sandy mixture.  Refrigerate while preparing the apples.Cut a small layer off the bottom of each apple to create a flat, stable bottom surface.  With a small paring knife, cut a cylindrical cone out of the top of the apple, moving about 1-inch outside of the core, similar to removing the top of a pumpkin when carving a Jack O\\'Lantern.  Remove the top and discard.  With a melon baller or a teaspoon, remove the remaining core and seeds taking care not to puncture the base of the apple.Place apples on a baking sheet or pie dish and fill each center with a teaspoon of honey. Spoon in mixture, packing lightly until heaped and overflowing over sides of the apples.Bake in oven at 350 degrees on the top or middle rack for 40 minutes or until filling is golden brown and the tip of a paring knife can be inserted into the side of the apple with little or no resistance. Let apples stand for 10 minutes before serving."

S'Preheat grill to 500 degrees F.  Place a brick, wrapped in aluminum foil onto the grates of the grill to heat.Place the vegetable oil into a 1-quart saucepan and place over high heat. Heat until you see ripples in the in the oil, but do not allow to smoke. Add the fennel, cumin, coriander, mustard seed and paprika. When the seeds begin to pop, remove from the heat and allow to sit for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, transfer the mixture to the carafe of a blender along with the almonds and salt. Pulse until pureed, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender, if necessary.Place the hen breast side down on a cutting board. Using scissors or poultry shears, cut from the neck to the tailbone to remove the backbone. Once you remove the backbone you will be able to see the inside of the bird. Make a small slit in the cartilage at the base of the breastbone to reveal the keel bone. Grab the bird with both hands on the ribs and open up like a book, facing down towards the cutting board. Remove the keel bone. Cut small slits in the skin of the bird behind the legs and tuck the drumsticks into them in order to hold them in place. Place the birds into a baking dish and pour over the puree. Rub the puree onto the birds until thoroughly coated.Place the birds onto the middle of the grill, skin side down and cover evenly with the brick. Close the lid and cook for 10 minutes. If using a gas grill with multiple zones, decrease the middle flame to low. After 10 minutes, turn the birds over, replace the brick and continue to cook until a thermometer inserted into the thigh reaches 170 degrees F, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack and allow the bird to rest for 5 minutes before serving.'

S'Combine all ingredients except  flour in a small, heavy saucepan  over med-high heat. Bring to a  boil, stirring often. Once mixture  is at a boil, stir constantly for 2  minutes. Remove from heat and sift  in flour a little at a time,  stirring to combine each addition  before adding the next. Cool to  room temperature or refrigerate for  later use. (If refrigerated, allow  mixture to come up to room  temperature before cooking.)Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cover a  backing pan or cookie sheet with  parchment paper and spoon out  mixture with a metal soup spoon or  a number 50 disher. Cookies will  spread out like crazy, so place  dollops 6 to 8 inches apart. Bake  18 minutes or until deep mahogany  brown.To form into cups, use a metal  spatula to transfer the hot candy  disks to the bottoms of inverted  ramekins or custard cups. (Have a  ramekin for each disk, or the disks  will set before you can get through  them all.) Work quickly and the  disks will conform to the shape of  the cups. Remove when cool and  store wrapped with paper towel  inside resealable plastic bags.

S'Place the oil and seeds into a 10-inch saute pan and set over medium-high heat. Toast the seeds while constantly moving the pan. You will smell their aroma and hear some of them begin to crackle when they are toasted, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the seeds to a small mixing bowl, add the cayenne, cinnamon and salt and stir to combine.Line a half sheet pan with a silicone baking mat.Place a 3-quart saucier inside a large cast iron skillet. Add the sugar and water to the saucepan, and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until it comes to a boil. Stop stirring, cover and cook for 3 minutes. Uncover, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the sugar is a light amber color, approximately 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the pumpkin seed mixture. This will greatly reduce the temperature of the sugar, so work quickly. Once evenly mixed, pour the mixture onto the prepared half sheet pan. Using an oiled spatula, spread thin. You will have to work quickly when pouring out and spreading the mixture in the pan. Cool completely, approximately 30 minutes, and then break into pieces. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.'

S"Heat a small non-stick skillet over low heat and add butter.  As soon as the butter stops foaming, crack the eggs into the pan.  Lift the handle about an inch so that the eggs pool in the far corner of the pan. Hold for 30 seconds or until the whites start to set, then lower the handle and give the pan a jiggle just to make sure there\\'s no sticking.  Season  with a pinch of salt and pepper and continue to cook over low heat until the whites become opaque.  Jiggle to loosen the eggs, then lift the pan, holding it about a foot above the heat. Now, flip the eggs over by pushing the pan away and snapping upward simultaneously.  Once the eggs start their somersault, raise the pan to meet them so that the exposed yolks experience the softest landing possible.  The goal of course is to avoid breaking the yolks. If you succeed, count to 10 slowly then flip the eggs again, slide them onto a plate and serve.  If  the yolks do break, act like you meant them to, fry for another minute and serve.  They\\'ll still taste great."

Distribute the cheese evenly over the mustard, season with fresh black pepper and top with second piece of bread. Spritz the bread surface that\\'s staring up at you with olive oil using either a Misto or a pump sprayer. A light coat will do, don\\'t soak.When the pans are hot enough to vigorously sizzle a drop of water, remove them from the heat and place the sandwich, top-side down in the middle of one pan. (if your pans are a different size, this would be the smaller one.) Spritz the slice now facing you, as well as the bottom of the other skillet. Lay the skillet right on top of the sandwich. If the top pan isn\\'t cast iron, weigh it down with a brick, can, or something of similar heft. Wait patiently, crack a beer. When you hear the first bit of cheese run out and sizzle on the pan, it\\'s done. This will take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes.  Carefully remove the top skillet, (you may need to coax it off with a spatula, but I doubt it). Just look at it. It\\'s perfect ... better than mom\\'s.

Using scissors or poultry shears, cut from the neck to the tailbone to remove the backbone. Once you remove the backbone you will be able to see the inside of the bird. Make a small slit in the cartilage at the base of the breastbone to reveal the keel bone. Grab the bird with both hands on the ribs and open up like a book, facing down towards the cutting board. Remove the keel bone. Cut small slits in the skin of the bird behind the legs and tuck the drumsticks into them in order to hold them in place. Season on both sides with salt and pepper.Fry the bacon in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once crisp, remove the bacon from the skillet and reserve. Drain all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan. Immediately add the two birds to the pan, skin side down. Add the onions to the pan around the edges. Top the birds with the brick and allow to remain on the heat for 5 minutes. Place the pan into the oven and cook 10 to 15 minutes or until the thigh meat reaches 170 degrees F.

After three days have passed, remove the pork from the brine, rinse the belly, and pat dry with paper towels. Lay on a rack over a sheet pan and place in front of a fan for 1 hour to form a pellicle. Lay the pork in the protein box of a cold smoker and smoke for 4 to 6 hours. Chill the meat in the freezer for 1 hour to stiffen for easy slicing into strips of bacon. Slice what you need and keep the remainder in a freezer safe bag in the refrigerator or freezer. Place the strips of bacon onto a sheet pan fitted with a rack and place into a cold oven. Turn the oven to 400 degrees and cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your bacon. Remove from rack and drain on paper towels. Enjoy.'

Stop the food processor and use a clean spatula to break up the mass, scraping the bottom and sides of the food processor. Leave the chocolate in the food processor for 1 minute without running or pulsing. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the processor after the 1-minute rest.Complete all the steps in the previous paragraph, 3 to 4 times or until the chocolate is smooth, fluid and reaches 90 to 91 degrees F. Do not let the chocolate go above 94 degrees F. If the chocolate is close to but not at 90 degrees, briefly heat with a 10-second blast of warm heat from a hair dryer until it reaches the correct temperature.Remove the food processor bowl from the base and the blade from the bowl. Continue scraping and stirring for 1 minute. Test the temper of the chocolate by spreading a small amount of chocolate in an even layer on a metal surface set over an ice pack. It should set within 3 minutes and be shiny and streak-free.If the temper test has some streaks, continue scraping and stirring for another minute and test again. The chocolate should maintain a temperature between 88 and 91 degrees F.As the chocolate begins to cool it will set on the sides of the food processor; as needed scrape down the sides of the bowl again and briefly heat with a 10-second blast of warm heat from a hair dryer until it is once again 91 degrees F.Stir two-thirds of the almonds and marshmallow creme into the chocolate just to combine and pour onto a sheet of parchment or a silicone mat set on a half sheet pan inverted over cold packs. Top with the remaining third of the almonds and marshmallow creme. Cool until set, approximately 30 minutes.Break into large pieces to serve. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.'

Immediately add the cheese and butter to the flour mixture. Stir to combine. Pour in the buttermilk and stir just to combine. Dump the dough onto a floured work surface and start folding the dough over on itself, gently kneading for 30 seconds, or until the dough is soft and smooth. Press the dough into a 1/2-inch thick round. Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut out the biscuits, being sure to push the cutter straight down through the dough to the work surface. Make your cuts as close together as possible to limit waste. Gather together any remaining dough, pat out again, and cut out as many biscuits as you can in order to get 9 total.To build the pie: Set the biscuits on top of the filling, placing 8 around the edge of the pan and 1 in the middle. Bake until the biscuits are tall and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on a cooling rack for 10 minutes before serving.'

Bring to room temperature before completing cake.)Heat oven to 325 degrees.Combine dry ingredients  and sift into fruit mixture.  Quickly bring batter together with a large wooden spoon, then stir in eggs one at a time until completely integrated, then fold in nuts.  Spoon into a 10-inch non-stick loaf pan and bake for 1 hour. Check for doneness by inserting toothpick into the middle of the cake.  If it comes out clean, it\\'s done.  If not, bake another 10 minutes, and check again. Remove cake from oven and place on cooling rack or trivet. Baste or spritz top with brandy and allow to cool completely before turning out from pan.When cake is completely cooled, seal in a tight sealing, food safe container.  Every 2 to 3 days, feel the cake and if dry, spritz with brandy.  The cake\\'s flavor will enhance considerably over the next two weeks.

S'In a blender, combine all of the ingredients (excepting the butter for coating the pan) and pulse for 10 seconds. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone. After they have cooled you can stack them and store in sealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months. When using frozen crepes, thaw on a rack before gently peeling apart.'

Put the squash in a 10-inch nonstick, oven-safe saute pan set over medium heat. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and stir with a silicone spatula to make sure egg gets under the squash. Cook without stirring until the egg mixture has set on the bottom and begins to set on top, about 4 to 5 minutes. Put the pan under the broiler until lightly browned and puffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Loosen the frittata from the pan by moving a rubber spatula around the edges.  Slide the frittata onto a plate or other serving dish, and cut into 6 servings. Serve warm or at room temperature.'

Remove from the heat and place in the refrigerator for 3 days.After three days have passed, remove the pork from the brine, rinse the belly, and pat dry with paper towels. Lay on a rack over a sheet pan and place in front of a fan for 1 hour to form a pellicle. Lay the pork in the protein box of a cold smoker and smoke for 4 to 6 hours. Chill the meat in the freezer for 1 hour to stiffen for easy slicing into strips of bacon. Slice what you need and keep the remainder in a freezer safe bag in the refrigerator or freezer.Place the strips of bacon onto a sheet pan fitted with a rack and place into a cold oven. Turn the oven to 400 degrees and cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your bacon. Remove from rack and drain on paper towels. Enjoy.'

S'For the dough: in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter, and buttermilk. Add approximately 2 cups of the flour along with the yeast and salt; whisk until moistened and combined. Remove the whisk attachment and replace with a dough hook. Add all but 3/4 cup of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. Check the consistency of the dough and add more flour if necessary; the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. Knead on low speed 5 minutes more or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead by hand about 30 seconds. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, lightly oil the top of the dough, cover and let double in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.For the filling, combine the 8 ounces of sugar, lemon zest, fresh ginger, the 2 tablespoons candied ginger and the 5 ounces flour in a medium bowl. Mix until well combined. Set aside until ready to use. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 12 by 24-inch rectangle. Brush the 1-ounce of melted butter onto the dough and sprinkle the filling over the dough; press the filling lightly so it sticks to the dough. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Brush the beaten egg along the edge for a secure seal. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll cylinder seam side down. Brush the 2 ends with a little of the beaten egg and bring together to shape into a ring and firmly press together. Place on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 16 hours.  Remove the ring from the refrigerator, remove the plastic wrap and snip the top with scissors every 2 inches. Place in an oven that is turned off. Fill a shallow pan 2/3 full of boiling water and set on the rack below the ring. Close the oven door and let the dough rise until the ring looks slightly puffy, approximately 30 minutes. Remove the ring and the shallow pan of water from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When the oven is ready, place the ring on the middle rack and bake until golden brown, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, approximately 30 minutes.While the ring is baking, make the glaze by combining the jam, 1-ounce candied ginger, and the water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer. Stir and cook until the jam is melted and well mixed with the water, about 3 to 5 minutes. Continue to simmer until reduced and thickened slightly, about 3 to 5 minutes. Brush over the warm ring. Serve immediately.'

S"Pierce some holes in the skin of the eggplant (to avoid explosion) and grill over medium-high heat turning every 7 minutes, until the skin is blackened and the body is nice and soft. Total time for grilling is about 30 minutes. If you do not have a grill you can roast your eggplant in a 375 degree F oven for about 30 minutes.Remove eggplant from the grill and let cool.Once the eggplant is cool enough to handle, peel away the skin and discard. Place the eggplant flesh in a colander and drain for 10 minutes. In a food processor, combine garlic, lemon juice, tahini and parsley and pulse to combine. Add the eggplant flesh. Season with salt and pepper and pulse to combine. Adjust the flavor with more Tahini or lemon juice if you prefer. If it\\'s bitter, some sugar or honey will help. Research shows that the white variety of plant is sweeter in flavor."

S'Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375 degrees F.Coat a 10-inch aluminum tube pan or 2 (9 by 5-inch) loaf pans with 1 tablespoon of butter and dust with 2 tablespoons of the flour.Combine the remaining 12 ounces of butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and cream for 6 minutes on medium speed, using the paddle attachment. Stop once to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.  With the mixer running at lowest speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Again stopping once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. This will take approximately 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the vanilla and salt and beat on medium speed for 30 seconds.With the mixer on the lowest speed add the flour in 3 installments, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour, making sure each portion is fully incorporated before adding the next.  After the final addition, beat the batter for 30 seconds on medium speed until almost smooth.Scoop the batter into the prepared pan(s), dividing evenly if using 2 pans.  Bake for 1 hour in a tube pan or 40 minutes in loaf pans, until the internal temperature reaches 210 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. The crust will be golden brown and spring back when pressed, but the crack around the center will appear moist.Remove the cake from the oven to a cooling rack for 10 minutes.  Remove the cake from the pan(s) and cool on the rack.  Store the cake on the rack covered with a tea towel for up to 3 days.'

S'Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator. Place the dough onto a lightly floured piece of waxed paper. Lightly sprinkle the top of the dough with flour and roll out into a 12-inch circle. Place into a 9 1/2 to 10-inch tart pan that is 2 inches deep. Gently press the dough into the sides of the pan, crimping and trimming the edges as necessary. Set a pie bird in the center of the bottom of the pan. Place the pears into the unbaked pie shell in concentric circles starting around the edges, working towards the center and forming a slight mound in the center of the pie. Sprinkle the cranberries a little at a time as you go. Pour over any liquid that remains in the bowl. Roll out the second pie dough as the first. Place this dough over the apples, pressing the pie bird through the top crust. Press together the edges of the dough around the rim of the pie. Brush the top crust with the reduced juice everywhere except around the edge of the pie. Trim excess dough. Place the pie on a half sheet pan lined with parchment paper and bake on the floor of the oven for 30 minutes. Transfer to the lower rack of the oven and continue to bake another 20 minutes or until the pears are cooked through but not mushy. Remove to a rack and cool a minimum of 4 hours or until almost room temperature.'

S'Position an oven rack approximately 4 inches from the broiler and preheat to the high broil setting.Rinse and trim any green leaves from the head of the cauliflower, leaving as much of the center stalk as possible. Lay the head, stem up, on a cutting board and cut in half from top to bottom. Lay each half on its side and cut in half again. Slice each quarter pie style into wedges, so that a piece of core holds each wedge together and the outer edge thickness is not more than 3/4-inch thick. Lay the cauliflower onto a cooling rack set inside a half sheet pan and cover with aluminum foil, leaving one end open.Crush together the cumin, coriander, mustard, orange peel, turmeric, and fenugreek in a small ramekin using the end of a rolling pin. Place the oil in a large metal measuring cup or 1-quart saucepan and set over high heat until it shimmers. Immediately remove from the heat, add to the spice mixture, and steep for 5 minutes.Place the sheet pan into the oven and carefully pour in the water, seal the foil opening, and broil for 6 minutes. Remove the foil and brush the cauliflower with half of the seasoned oil. Sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Return to the oven and broil until browned, another 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the cauliflower over and brush with the remaining oil and sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. Return to the oven and broil until browned, another 5 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately.'

Lay on a rack over a sheet pan and place in front of a fan for 1 hour to form a pellicle. Lay the pork in the protein box of a cold smoker and smoke for 4 to 6 hours. Chill the meat in the freezer for 1 hour to stiffen for easy slicing into strips of bacon. Slice what you need and keep the remainder in a freezer safe bag in the refrigerator or freezer. Place the strips of bacon onto a sheet pan fitted with a rack and place into a cold oven. Turn the oven to 400 degrees and cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your bacon. Remove from rack and drain on paper towels. Enjoy.'

S'Heat oven to 400 degrees F.In a food processor, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, and salt.  Pulse to combine.  Place dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and put the bowl into the refrigerator.  Remove  1/2 stick of butter from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature.  In a food processor, add the  1/2 stick of butter to the flour mixture.  Pulse until the fat completely disappears.  Add the remaining 1 1/2 sticks butter in separate batches.  Pulse until flour mixture resembles the size of a pea.Combine the apple juice concentrate and the cold water. Using a spray bottle, spritz the dough with the apple juice mixture while folding the mixture with a spatula.  After about three tablespoons of the liquid, check the dough for consistency.  It should hold together when compressed but remain relatively dry to the touch.  If it does not bind, add a little more water.  Remove from the processor and form the dough into a ball.  Wrap the dough in wax paper or parchment paper and rest in refrigerator for 20 minutes.Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add pears to the pan and toss for 2 minutes.  Add the balsamic vinegar and continue to toss for 30 seconds.  Add sugar and cook until the pears have softened.  Add the nutmeg, cinnamon, and the butter and melt slowly.  Fold in the blueberries.  Remove from heat.  Sprinkle on the flour and combine well.  Allow to cool to room temperature.Place dough on a floured piece of parchment and roll out to a  1/4-inch thick disk.  Transfer to a baking sheet. Place cubed pound cake in the middle of the dough, leaving a 3-inch margin of crust on all sides.  Spoon filling over the cake cubes and top the pears with 1 ounce of cubed butter.  Lift excess crust onto filling and repeat in a clockwise fashion until a top lip has formed around the edge of the whole tart.  Brush the tart with the egg wash and sprinkle the crust with the sugar.Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the filling begins to bubble and the crust is golden brown.Remove from the sheet pan immediately and cool on pie rack.'

At this point, the greens can be quickly Sauteed for a mild garlic flavor.If you\\'re looking for something a little stronger, thinly sliver 1 clove and add it to the pan stirring constantly (burned garlic is not Good Eats, nor is anything that touches it). Once the slivers turn golden, add the greens and toss to coat with the hot oil. Season with salt and pepper as soon as the greens start to wilt and plate immediately.If you\\'re looking for even more garlic flavor, finely mince a clove of garlic and toss it into the greens during the last 30 seconds of cooking and toss the greens to distribute.

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Set aside.Place the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface and roll to 1/8-inch thick. Cut 12 (3 3/4- inch) circles from the puff pastry. If the dough begins to stick, lightly dust with flour.Place 2 teaspoons of the fruit compote onto the middle of each circle. Lightly brush the edges with the egg wash and fold the pastry over so that the edges meet. Using a fork, press the edges together to seal. Brush the tops of the pies with the egg wash and poke several holes in the top of the pies for steam to escape.Place the pies 1-inch apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake until golden brown, approximately 25 minutes.'

Pat the trout dry and toss to coat in the bag with the seasoned flour.Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch saute pan set over medium-high heat until it shimmers.  Carefully add the trout to the pan.  Cook on each side for 1 minute.  Using tongs or a fish spatula, transfer the trout to a 13 by 9-inch glass baking dish.  Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion, and cook until translucent, approximately 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.  Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, thyme, coriander, paprika, white wine, vinegar, and lemon zest.  Decrease the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and pour the marinade over the trout.  Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve cool or at room temperature with the sauce and onions.

S'For the dough: in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter and buttermilk. Add approximately 2 cups of the flour along with the yeast and salt; whisk until moistened and combined. Remove the whisk attachment and replace with a dough hook. Add all but 3/4 cup of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. Check the consistency of the dough and add more flour if necessary; the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. Knead on low speed 5 minutes more or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead by hand about 30 seconds. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, lightly oil the top of the dough, cover and let double in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the 8 ounces of unsalted butter, brown sugar, rosemary, and raisins. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved. Pour half of the topping into the bottom of 2 bundt pans and set aside. Cover and store the other half of the topping in the refrigerator until the next morning.Place the melted butter and rosemary for the coating in a medium shallow bowl and stir to combine. Once the dough has risen, turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Portion the dough into 1-ounce pieces; roll each piece into a ball. (You should have approximately 36 balls.) Roll the balls in the melted butter and rosemary.Divide the balls evenly between the 2 bundt pans. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight or up to 16 hours.Remove the bread from the refrigerator and place in an oven that is turned off. Fill a shallow pan 2/3-full of boiling water and set on the rack below the bread. Close the oven and let the bread rise until slightly puffy looking, 20 to 30 minutes. Once the bread has risen, remove it and the shallow pan of water from the oven.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Once the oven is ready, place the bread on the middle rack and bake until slightly golden on top, approximately 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.Place the remaining topping in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Reheat until the mixture is pourable, approximately 5 minutes. Fifteen minutes into baking, pour the remaining topping over the bread, and finish cooking. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes, then invert onto a platter or cutting board. Serve immediately.'

S"In a bowl, mix together salt, sugar, brown sugar and peppercorns. Spread extra-wide aluminum foil a little longer than the length of the fish and top with an equally long layer of plastic wrap. Sprinkle 1/3 of the rub onto the plastic. Lay 1 side of the fish skin down onto the rub. Sprinkle 1/3 of the rub onto the flesh of the salmon. Place second side of salmon, flesh down onto the first side. Use the remaining rub to cover the skin on the top piece. Fold plastic over to cover then close edges of foil together and crimp tightly around the fish. Place wrapped fish onto a plank or sheet pan and top with another plank or pan. Weigh with a heavy phone book or a brick or two and refrigerate for 12 hours. Flip the fish over and refrigerate another 12 hours. Some juice will leak out during the process so make sure there\\'s a place for the runoff to gather.Unwrap fish and rinse off the cure with cold water. Pat salmon with paper towels then place in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator) until the surface of the fish is dry and matte-like, 1 to 3 hours depending on humidity. A fan may be used to speed the process. Smoke fish (see Note) over smoldering hardwood chips or sawdust, keeping the temperature inside the smoker between 150 degrees F and 160 degrees F until the thickest part of the fish registers 150 degrees. Serve immediately or cool to room temperature, wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to 3 days.Cook\\'s Note: Trout, mackerel, and bluefish also smoke well.Per Serving (about 1.6 ounces per serving): Calories 86; Total Fat 5 grams; Saturated Fat 1 gram;  Protein 8 grams; Total Carbohydrate 1 gram; Sugar: 1 gram; Fiber 0 grams; Cholesterol 22 milligrams; Sodium 484 milligrams"

Moving the leaves around in the water and allowing them to sit for a few minutes to allow the sand or dirt to fall to the bottom of the sink. Once clean, roughly chop the greens. You should have 1 pound finished greens once they are stemmed. (Weigh the greens after stemming, but before washing.) After washing the greens, place them in a salad spinner to thoroughly dry them.Butter a 9 by 11-inch or 2 1/2-quart baking dish and set aside.In a large mixing bowl whisk together the eggs, ricotta, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Set aside.In a large, 13 by 11-inch roasting pan set over 2 burners on medium heat, melt the butter in 1 corner of the pan. Add the garlic, mushrooms, and a pinch of salt and cook until the mushrooms give up their liquid, approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Add the greens and cook until they are wilted, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. The greens will reduce to less than 1/4 of their original volume and begin to look like thawed, frozen spinach. Remove the pan from the heat.Add the greens to the egg and cheese mixture and stir to thoroughly combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish, top with the crackers, place on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve.'

Stir and cook over high heat.  Once bubbles begin to form on the surface, reduce to a simmer.  Allow liquid to reduce by 1/2 or until liquid has thickened to a loose syrup consistency.Squeeze each tomato thoroughly to ensure most seeds are removed.  Set the tomatoes aside. Cut carrot, onion, and celery into uniform sizes and combine with olive oil and garlic in a non-reactive roasting pan over low heat.  Sweat the mirepoix until the carrots are tender and the onion becomes translucent, 15 to 20 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and capers to the roasting pan.Place roasting pan on the middle rack of the oven and broil for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  Tomatoes should start to brown slightly on edges with light caramelization.  Remove the pan from the broiler.  Place the pan over 2 burners on the stove.  Add the white wine to the tomatoes and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes over medium heat.Put the tomatoes into a deep pot or bowl and add the reduced tomato liquid to the tomatoes.

Roll out into ropes and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Line the pieces up on a floured sheet pan as you work. At this point you could freeze them on the pan until solid, then transfer to zip top bags and store in the freezer.In a large pot of boiling, salted water gently drop in the dumplings. Don\\'t overcrowd. As they begin to float, remove them with a slotted spoon and toss them into an ice bath.Drain off the water and toss in a little oil. Store loosely in containers until ready to use.To reheat, in a saute pan over high heat add 1 tablespoon of soft butter. Cook until the butter begins to foam and turn brown.

S"Put the duck, breast side down, on a cutting board and using kitchen shears, cut up 1 side of the spine, starting at the tail or pope\\'s nose, all the way to the top.  Turn the bird around and cut back down the other side of the spine, being careful not to cut into the thigh.  Press down on the bird to flatten and make a shallow cut through the breastbone to further flatten the duck.  Remove the neck flap and any extra pockets of fat.  Turn the duck over, breast side up, and make a long slash in the skin and fat of each breast, making sure not to puncture the meat.Sprinkle both sides of the duck with the kosher salt and lay the duck, breast side up, on top of a broiler pan.  Line the bottom of the pan with paper towels.  Put the duck, uncovered, on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or until the skin is dry and reaches a near parchment consistency.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.If there is still salt visible, brush it off.  Remove the paper towels from the bottom of the pan.  Put the pan in the middle of the oven and roast for 30 minutes.  Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue to cook until the thigh reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 more minutes.Remove the duck from the oven and increase the heat to 450 degrees F.  Once the oven has come to temperature, return the duck to the oven and roast until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes.Remove the top of the broiler pan, with the duck still on it, and put it on a sheet pan to rest.  Pour off the duck fat from the bottom of the pan, measure 1/4 cup, and reserve the rest for another use.Decrease the oven heat to 350 degrees F.Put the broiler pan on the stove over medium heat and add the 1/4 cup of the fat.  Add the onions, celery, salt, and pepper.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions and celery are translucent, approximately 10 minutes.Meanwhile, combine the cornbread, oyster crackers, thyme, sage, eggs, oysters and their liquor in a large mixing bowl and use your hands to mix well, breaking up the oysters as you go.  Add the onion and celery mixture to the bowl and stir to combine.  Transfer the dressing back into the broiler pan and spread evenly.  Put the dressing on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden brown and crisp around the edges, about 30 to 35 minutes.  Transfer the duck to a serving platter and serve with the dressing."

S"Combine the half-and-half and heavy cream in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and set aside. Whisk the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl until they lighten in color. Gradually whisk the sugar into the yolks until smooth.Slowly ladle one-third of the hot dairy into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Return this mixture to the pot containing the rest of the dairy. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until the custard thickens slightly, enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 to 175 degrees F.Wash the original mixing bowl. When the custard is ready, transfer to the bowl, whisk in the coffee liqueur, espresso powder and vanilla, and cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until the temperature drops below 40 degrees F, 3 to 4 hours.Liquid nitrogen procedure: Pour the ice cream base into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Turn the speed to low. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the liquid nitrogen while counting to ten. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 1 minute. Serve immediately or store in freezer.Ice cream maker procedure: Pour into a prepped ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer\\'s directions. Within 25 to 30 minutes the ice cream will attain a classic soft-serve consistency. Serve as is for soft serve or freeze for another 3 to 4 hours to allow the ice cream to harden."

S'It is very important to sterilize all equipment that will come into contact with the beer. Also the hops, yeast, and Irish moss need to be kept refrigerated until use. Begin by sterilizing your equipment that you will use to boil the mash; the pot, metal spoon, probe of the probe thermometer, colander and strainer, including the fermenter. To sterilize everything put 2 ounces of non-scented household bleach and 3 to 4 gallons of water into the fermenter. Place other smaller items in the solution to soak. The items that are too large to fit into the fermenter can be sterilized by pouring the solution in the fermenter into and over these items and then thoroughly rinsing all equipment, including the fermenter.After sterilization is complete you can begin brewing beer by adding 2 gallons of spring water as well as the 1/2 pound milled grain to your pot and turn the burner on to medium high. Place the probe thermometer into the pot and set the temperature to 155 degrees, once the liquid reaches 155 degrees set a timer for 30 minutes. In the meantime soak the container of liquid malt extract in warm water; it will aid in removing it from the container. After the grain has cooked for 30 minutes add 1 gallon of water and the liquid malt extract and bring to a boil stirring so that the extract does not burn on the bottom until dissolved. The liquid will foam up to the top; when it does this, turn the heat off and let it settle then turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Let it foam again and turn the heat off, let it settle and turn the heat back on and add the hops. Add 1-ounce of the Cascade hops and 3/4-ounce of Kent goldings hops and boil for 10 minutes. Next add 1/2 teaspoon Irish moss and boil for 5 minutes. Now add the last hops, 1-ounce Kent Goldings, cover, turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Meanwhile put the last gallon and 1 pint of water as well as the bag of ice into the fermenter and fit the top with the colander and mesh strainer. Strain the mash into the fementer and allow to cool to 80 degrees before pitching the yeast. Once the mash is cooled to 80 degrees it is now safe to add the yeast, shake the vial until the liquid is well mixed and then add to the fermenter. Cover with the lid and put airlock in place. Put into cool dark place to ferment for 7 to 10 days.Attach the siphon on the spigot and transfer beer from one fermenter to the second one. Add the sugar/water mixture. Bottle using the wand. Cap and place into a cool dark place for another 10 to 14 days.Open and enjoy.'

Allow to dry for 1 hour or until there are no visible signs of moisture on the chips.Place the oil into a 5-quart pot or Dutch oven and heat to 365 to 375 degrees F. Gently lower the chips, 5 to 6 at a time, into the oil and fry for 20 to 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon or spider, remove the chips to a newspaper-lined sheet pan. Allow to cool 3 to 4 minutes before serving.*If you prefer plain tortilla chips simply stack the fresh tortillas, cut into quarters and fry according to the instructions above. If you are making chips from the Good Eats recipe in this episode, the cooking time will be 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.'

S'For the turkey: Four days before service, place the salt, sage, thyme, black peppercorns, and allspice into a spice grinder and pulse until the peppercorns and allspice are coarsely ground, 5 to 6 pulses. Set aside.Set the turkey, breast-side down, on a large cutting board with the tail closest to you. Use an electric knife or heavy-duty kitchen shears to cut up one side of the backbone. Turn the bird around and cut back down the other side of the spine. Reserve the backbone for Giblet Stock. Discard any fat pockets or excess skin found inside the turkey. Turn the turkey breast-side up and use the heel of your hands to press down on both breasts, until you hear a cracking sound and the bird has flattened slightly.Rub the seasoned salt on both sides of the turkey. Place the turkey on a parchment paper lined half sheet pan, breast-side up with legs running with the long side of the pan. Store, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 4 days.Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for 1 hour.For the panzanella: Place the parsnips and rutabaga in a large nonstick roasting pan, toss with vegetable oil and set aside.Place one rack in the middle of the oven and a second one far enough below so the roasting pan will fit. Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.Place the turkey directly on the middle rack of the oven with the legs perpendicular to the metal bars of the rack. Place the roasting pan with the parsnips and rutabaga on the rack below the turkey and roast both for 30 minutes.Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Add the red onion to the roasting vegetables and stir to combine. Continue to roast both the vegetables and the turkey until a probe thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155 degrees F, an additional 40 to 50 minutes.Remove the turkey from the oven onto a cooling rack set inside a half sheet pan and rest for 30 minutes.Add the Brussels sprouts, bread cubes and garlic to the roasting vegetables, stir to combine and roast for an additional 15 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the oven and immediately transfer to a serving bowl. Pour the apple cider vinegar in the warm roasting pan, stir and scrape off any browned bits from the pan. Pour the vinegar mixture over the salad, add the thyme and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper as desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.Carve the turkey with an electric knife and serve with the panzanella.'

S'In heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Stir until thoroughly combined. Add corn syrup, water, and vinegar to pan and place over medium heat. Stir until sugar and cocoa dissolve, raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Turn heat down to low, clip candy thermometer to side of pan and cook until mixture reaches 260 degrees F. Remove pan from heat, add the butter and stir. Butter edges of sheet pan, line with silicone baking sheet and pour on taffy.  Allow to cool until you are able to handle it. Once you are able to handle the taffy, don vinyl gloves, butter them, and begin to fold taffy in thirds using the silicone mat. Pick up taffy and begin to pull folding the taffy back on itself repeatedly twisting as you go. Taffy is done when it lightens in color, takes on a sheen, and becomes too hard to pull. Roll into log, cut into fourths, roll each fourth into a 1-inch wide log, and cut into 1-inch pieces. Making sure to keep pieces separated or they will stick to each other. Wrap individual pieces of candy in waxed paper. Store in airtight container 3 to 5 days.'

S'For the jam:  Place blueberries in saucepan over medium-low heat.  Sprinkle with pectin followed by the anise, nutmeg, lemon juice and vinegar. Once liquid starts to gather in bottom of pan, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil.  Lower heat slightly and boil gently for five minutes occasionally mashing mixture.  Mash in sugar, add the water and return to a boil for 1 minute.  You just made jam.  Cool, jar, refrigerate and enjoy within 2 weeks.  Or, move to the preserving phase. Preserving the jam: Thoroughly wash all hardware in hot soapy water.  Then pile everything (excluding the jar lids) into the pot. Cover with hot water by at least 1-inch and bring to a boil and maintain for 10 full minutes to sterilize.  Turn off the heat, wait 5 minutes then add the lids (waiting will insure that the sealing compound does not melt).  Leave all hardware in the pot until you\\\'re ready to can. Remove the ladle, tongs, funnel and other tools from the pot,  (careful please, it\\\'s hot in there) to a clean towel or paper towels.  Using the jar tongs, remove and drain the jars, placing them on the towel/paper towel surface. (Avoid rock or metal surfaces which could result in thermal shock and breakage.)Place the funnel in the first jar (pick it up by the ring, avoiding the sterile interior.) Use the ladle to fill each jar just to the bottom of the funnel, about 1/3-inch from the bottom of the jar threads.  This "headspace" is necessary for the jars to seal during processing. Wipe the jar rims with a moist paper towel, checking for any cracks or irregularities as you go.  Use the magnetized device of your choice to position lids on each jar.  Screw the rings on finger tight. (Remember, the rings don\\\'t seal the jars they only hold the lids in place.  Heat will drive out the headspace air, which when cooled will create a vacuum, thus sealing the jars) Return the jars to the pot being certain that they don\\\'t touch the bottom of the pot or each other.  (If you don\\\'t have a jar rack, try a round cake rack, or metal mesh basket.  Even a folded kitchen towel on the pot bottom will do in a pinch.)  Add additional water if necessary to cover the jars by at least an inch, and bring to a hard boil over high heat according to the table below.  (Be sure not to start your timer until a true boil is reached.  The headroom air may bubble out of the jars before a boil is reached.  Don\\\'t be fooled.) Processing times: Within 1,000 feet of sea level: 5 minutes 1,000 -- 3,000 feet above sea level: 10 minutes 3,001- 6,000 feet above sea level: 15 minutes 6,000 -- 8,000 feet above sea level: 20 minutes Above 8,000 feet: wait until you\\\'re back down at base camp.'

Lightly brush the cut side of the romaine pieces with olive oil. Season with the pepper. Place the cheese in a shallow pan large enough to lay the romaine in and press the cheese firmly onto the cut side of the romaine until it adheres. Spray a nonstick griddle or saute pan with vegetable spray and preheat over medium-high heat.

To store, pour the tomato vodka back into its original bottle and keep in a cool, dark place.Make the Bloody Marys: Put the cherry tomatoes, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, cover and blend on high speed for 1 1/2 minutes. Fill an ice cube tray with about 2 cups of the juice; freeze overnight. Pour the remaining juice into a lidded container and reserve on the counter overnight. (Refrigeration will destroy these particular flavors and aromas.)Just before serving, put 3 frozen cubes in each of 4 Collins glasses and add 1 1/2 ounces tomato vodka to each glass. Stir the reserved juice, pour 4 ounces into each glass and serve immediately.Photograph by Christina HolmesMake Alton\\'s tomato vodka ahead of time and keep it on hand: It infuses for at least 5 days."

S"*Cook\\'s Note: You will need half of the herbs when you start the recipe and half in 2 weeks. It is best to purchase the second half of the herbs when they are needed.If using pint jars for storage, you will need 3 jars. If using small wine bottles, each holds approximately 13 ounces; therefore, you will need 4 bottles. Put the water and bleach in a large container. Dunk 12 sprigs of tarragon and 12 chive shoots in the solution, and then rinse in cold water. Pat dry.Heat the vinegar in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, and heat until vinegar reaches 190 degrees F. Place the herbs in a container large enough to hold the vinegar. Pour the vinegar over the herbs, and after the vinegar has cooled, place the lid on the container. Set in a cool dark place for 2 weeks.After 2 weeks, sanitize the second half of the herbs as previously, rinse, pat dry, and set aside. Sterilize the containers and lids that you will store the vinegar in by immersing them in a large pot of boiling water and boiling for 10 minutes. If using corks, purchase pre-sterilized corks, and then dip them in and out of boiling water 3 to 4 times.Discard the old herbs. Strain the vinegar through a sanitized colander or funnel lined with cheesecloth. Divide the fresh herbs among the containers and pour the vinegar over them. Seal and refrigerate. The vinegar may be stored at room temperature for 5 to 6 weeks or in the refrigerator for up to 6 months."

Grill over direct, high heat, cut side down, with lid closed, approximately 6 to 7 minutes or until grill marks appear. Remove the leeks to a sheet of aluminum foil and lay cut side up. Brush the leeks with balsamic vinegar. Reassemble the leek halves together, wrap tightly in foil, and set back on the grill away from direct heat for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the leeks from the foil and serve immediately, as is or with crumbled bacon and goat cheese.'

Using a wooden spoon or tongs, gently bend noodles to submerge. Cover pot and return to a rolling boil, reducing heat to medium-high.  Stir occasionally. Pour 3 tablespoons of good quality extra-virgin olive oil into the bottom of a wide serving bowl along with garlic.In 4 minutes, start tasting. When done, a string of spaghetti should be springy when pulled on. To the tooth, there should be some resistance but not so much that the pasta sticks in the teeth. As soon as pasta is done, drain immediately in a large colander (lidded models are the best). Shake pasta to stop cooking but don\\'t shake dry.  And no rinsing!  Add pasta to serving bowl and toss to coat. Quickly divide into individual bowls and toss with various toppings."

S'For the hen: Put the hen in a 1 gallon re-sealable plastic bag with the water, honey, and salt. Seal the bag and move around vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes to distribute the honey and dissolve the salt. Set the bag in a leak-proof container and refrigerate for 1 hour.For the pastry: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Whisk together the flour and salt in a small mixing bowl and set aside. Combine the milk, water, and lard in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, approximately 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, add the flour all at once, and stir with a wooden spoon until combined and the mixture begins to form into a ball of dough.Place the dough onto a floured work surface and knead until cooled, approximately 5 minutes. Divide the dough in half, and divide one of the pieces in half again. Set aside.For the egg wash: Combine the egg and water in a small bowl. Set aside.To build the pot pie: Remove the hen from the brine and pat dry. Use kitchen shears to cut away the skin from the breast of the hen. Place the dried fruit into the cavity of the hen and tie the legs with butchers twine. Place the hen in the center of a piece of parchment and trace an oval approximately 1/2-inch larger than the hen, approximately 8 1/2 inches long by 6 1/2 inches wide. Remove the hen from the parchment and turn the paper over to avoid getting pencil on the dough.Roll the two quarters of dough into ovals according to the template; this is the base and the top of the pot pie. Place one of the ovals in the center of the parchment. Set the other oval aside. Roll the remaining half of dough into a 1/2-inch thick and 4-inch wide strip of dough that will go around the oval piece and surround the hen. Brush around the edge of the base pastry with egg wash. Place the thyme sprigs on the base, then top with the hen.  Place the 4-inch wide strip of dough around the hen, forming a "wall" around the hen.  Press the ends together. Press down to seal this to the base pastry. Sprinkle the hen with the allspice, black pepper, cumin, and paprika. Brush the top of the "wall" with egg wash. Place the remaining oval of pastry on top of the hen and crimp, attaching the top to the wall. Patch any holes with excess dough. Brush the entire pastry with egg wash. Bake until the hen reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F, about1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and rest 20 minutes before serving.'

S'*Cooks note: If eating peanuts roasted right out of the shell, use Virginia or Valencia peanuts. If utilizing roasted peanuts to make peanut butter, use Spanish peanuts as they have a higher oil content.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Rinse the peanuts under cool water to remove excess dirt. Pat dry and place in a large bowl and toss with the peanut oil and salt until well coated.Place on 2 half sheet pans, making sure to spread them out into a single layer. Roast in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through cooking. Once you remove the peanuts from the oven, let them cool slightly before eating. They will continue to "cook" and become crunchy as they cool. If using peanuts to make peanut butter, remove shells and discard. Remove the skin by rubbing the peanuts together in your hands held over a salad spinner, allowing the peanuts and skins to fall into the bowl. Once the skin has been loosened from all of the peanuts close the salad spinner and spin until all of the skin has been separated from the peanuts.Yield: approximately 2 pounds roasted peanuts in shell'

S'Tips on Sterilizing JarsProperly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years. Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods. Sterilizing Tips: Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed. To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.'

Stack "wall" pieces on top of "floor" piece placing the cut edge of the "walls" on the outside edge. Dab ends of "walls" with egg wash and fold long pieces over to form a square.Cut a 7 by 7-inch square out of the second sheet of puff pastry. Fold it in half and cut vents for steam along the fold.Shake bread or cake crumbs on drained cherries and let sit for 10 minutes. Spoon cherry mixture onto pastry "floor", using more than you may think necessary to compensate for the pastry puffing. Apply egg wash on "walls" avoiding the very edge.Lay vented "top" piece on top.

S'The day before making the stuffing, bake the cornbread: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and place a 10-inch cast-iron skillet in the oven. In a bowl, combine the cornmeal, salt, sugar, baking powder and baking soda. Whisk to combine well. In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, eggs and creamed corn, whisking to combine thoroughly. Add the dry ingredients to the buttermilk mixture and stir to combine. If the batter will not pour, add more buttermilk.Swirl the vegetable oil in the hot cast-iron skillet. Pour the batter into the skillet and bake until the cornbread is golden brown and springs back upon the touch, about 20 minutes. Let cool in the skillet, then crumble 6 cups of the cornbread and spread out on a baking sheet. Let the cornbread dry out at room temperature, uncovered, about 24 hours.Make the stuffing: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the vegetable oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion and celery are semitranslucent, about 15 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat; add the crumbled cornbread, oyster crackers, thyme and sage and stir well. Next, add the oysters with their liquor and the eggs; stir until combined. Pat the mixture down into an even layer.Put the skillet on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden brown and crisp around the edges, about 30 to 35 minutes.Photograph by Linda Pugliese'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cardamom, clove and salt.Place the brown sugar and butter into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on low speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the molasses, egg and fresh ginger and beat on medium for 1 minute. Add the crystallized ginger and using a rubber spatula, stir to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir until well combined.With a 2-teaspoon-sized scoop, drop the dough onto a parchment-lined half sheet pan approximately 2 inches apart. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 12 minutes for slightly chewy cookies or 15 minutes for more crisp cookies. Rotate the pan halfway through cooking.Remove from the oven, sprinkle with sanding sugar, if desired, and allow the cookies to stay on the sheet pan for 30 seconds before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with all of the dough. Store in an airtight container for up to 10 days. If desired, you may scoop and freeze the cookie dough on a sheet pan and once frozen, place in a resealable bag to store. Bake directly from the freezer as above.'

S'In a blender, combine all of the ingredients and pulse for 10 seconds. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone. After they have cooled you can stack them and store in sealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months. When using frozen crepes, thaw on a rack before gently peeling apart.'

Stir and cook over high heat.  Once bubbles begin to form on the surface, reduce to a simmer.  Allow liquid to reduce by 1/2 or until liquid has thickened to a loose syrup consistency.Squeeze each tomato thoroughly to ensure most seeds are removed.  Set the tomatoes aside. Cut carrot, onion, and celery into uniform sizes and combine with olive oil and garlic in a non-reactive roasting pan over low heat.  Sweat the mirepoix until the carrots are tender and the onion becomes translucent, 15 to 20 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and capers to the roasting pan.Place roasting pan on the middle rack of the oven and broil for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  Tomatoes should start to brown slightly on edges with light caramelization.  Remove the pan from the broiler.  Place the pan over 2 burners on the stove.  Add the white wine to the tomatoes and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes over medium heat.Put the tomatoes into a deep pot or bowl and add the reduced tomato liquid to the tomatoes.

S"Combine the powdered sugar, dry milk and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 4 to 5 times until the mixture is smooth and well combined.  Set aside.Combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a 2-quart pot.  Put over medium heat, cover and cook for 4 minutes.  Add the butter, clip on a candy thermometer, and bring the mixture to 230 degrees F, about 1 to 2 minutes.  When the sugar syrup reaches 230 degrees F, take the pot off the heat and remove the thermometer.  Add the vanilla and the dry mixture, stirring continuously with a silicone spatula until well combined.  Pour onto a half sheet pan lined with a silicone baking mat.  Cool until the mixture is cool enough to handle, about 10 to 15 minutes.Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Add 2 drops of yellow food coloring to 1 piece and knead the dough until the color is consistent throughout. Add 2 drops of orange to the second piece, and knead until the color is consistent throughout. Leave the third piece white.  Roll each piece of dough into a strand, about 18-inches long.  Cut each strand in half.Roll 1 of the white pieces into a strand that is about 1/2-inch thick and about 22-inches long.  Repeat with a yellow piece and orange piece.  Lay the strands side by side and press them together using your fingers.  Cut the strand into 4-inch pieces.  Lay the strands, 1 at a time, onto the silicone mat and press into a wedge shape, like a triangle.  Use a wire butter slicer to cut the candies into pieces.  If you don\\'t have a wire butter slicer, use a knife, metal bench scraper or pizza cutter to slice the dough into small pieces.  Repeat the procedure with remaining dough. Lay the finished pieces on a piece of parchment or waxed paper to dry for 1 hour.  Store in an airtight container with parchment paper between each layer."

S"Remove roast from pan and pour off any fat.  Place over high heat (use 2 burners if necessary)  and deglaze pan with wine and broth, scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula. Once these solids are dissolved, pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3.At this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast.  To create a gravy, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux.  Return to a simmer, whisking constantly. Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce, but not a thicker one.Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool, it\\'s a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side."

S'On your counter top lay out a sheet of parchment paper and top it with a layer of plastic wrap.Lay out your fillets of salmon, tails away from you. Overlap the fillets of flounder about 1-inch over the tails of the salmon. Then place the scallops on a metal skewer and set at the end of the flounder furthest from you. Sprinkle the herbs over the fish and season with salt and pepper.Using the plastic wrap pull the fish towards you so that the plastic begins to pull the flounder over the scallops. Be sure not to roll the plastic into the fish roll. Use a sheet pan to push the roll tightly as you pull the plastic toward you. The roll should be tight and you should be able to remove the sheet of plastic. Then roll the fish in the parchment away from you so it is covered and can be place into the refrigerator. Refrigerate for 1 hour.For Compound Butter: In a large bowl using a wooden spoon mix all ingredients. Place the mixture on a piece of parchment and fold the parchment over itself. Pull to form a roll and twist the ends. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes to set up. Slice into 1/4-inch rounds and remove the parchment.Preheat your broiler and place the oven rack 6-inches from the heating element.Remove the metal skewer and slice the roulade into 3/4 to 1-inch rounds. Place onto a broiler pan and brush each round with canola oil. Put under the broiler for 3 to 6 minutes depending on how well done you like your fish.Serve with 1 slice of compound butter on each fish roll.'

S'Line two 13-by-9-inch metal cake pans with plastic wrap and place in the freezer.Pour the chocolate ice cream base into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Turn the speed to low. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the liquid nitrogen until the ice cream reaches a classic soft-serve consistency.Spread the ice cream evenly in one of the prepared pans and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours. May be made several days in advance.Clean the bowl and paddle and repeat with the strawberry ice cream.Set the chiffon cake into a parchment-lined half sheet pan and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour and up to several hours in advance of assembling the Baked Alaska.Combine 8 ounces sugar, 4 ounces corn syrup and 2 ounces water in a 2-quart saucepan and place over high heat. Stir just until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Clip on a candy thermometer and bring the mixture to 240 degrees F.While the syrup is cooking, place 4 ounces egg whites, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and one pinch salt into the bowl of a stand mixer and using the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on high speed until they reach medium peaks, 2 to 3 minutes.When the sugar syrup reaches 240 degrees F, remove from the heat and with the stand mixer on low speed, slowly and carefully pour the syrup in a thin steady stream into the egg white mixture, being careful not to come in contact with the whisk. Once all of the syrup has been added, increase the mixer speed to high and whisk until stiff peaks are formed and the mixture has cooled, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large piping bag and refrigerate while preparing the second and third batches. Repeat the recipe two more times for a total of three batches of meringue.Remove the meringue from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to using.To assemble and complete the Baked Alaska: Cover the perimeter of a large, wooden cutting board, one that is slightly larger than the cake, with strips of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Remove the cake and ice cream from the freezer. Place the cake on the prepared board. Invert the sheet pans of ice cream atop the cake. Peel away the plastic wrap from the ice cream. Pipe the meringue over the entire surface of cake and ice cream covering completely.Use a propane torch to brown the meringue. Serve immediately or freeze for up to a week once the meringue has been brownedPropane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat, open flame, and prolonged exposure to sunlight. They should only be used in well-ventilated areas. When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you. Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve. Light the gas jet, and blow out the match. Always turn off the burner valve to "finger tight" when finished using the torch. Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision.'

S"Combine the brine, water and ice in the 5-gallon bucket. Place the thawed turkey (with innards removed) breast side down in brine. If necessary, weigh down the bird to ensure it is fully immersed, cover, and refrigerate or set in cool area for 8 to 16 hours, turning the bird once half way through brining.Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Remove the bird from brine and rinse inside and out with cold water. Discard the brine. Place the bird on roasting rack inside a half sheet pan and pat dry with paper towels. Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick, and 1 cup of water in a microwave safe dish and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add steeped aromatics to the turkey\\'s cavity along with the rosemary and sage. Tuck the wings underneath the bird and coat the skin liberally with canola oil. Roast the turkey on lowest level of the oven at 500 degrees F for 30 minutes. Insert a probe thermometer into thickest part of the breast and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Set the thermometer alarm (if available) to 151 degrees F. A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2 hours of roasting. Let the turkey rest, loosely covered with foil or a large mixing bowl for 15 minutes before carving."

S"NOTE: Great mashed potatoes hate recipes. Although the above amounts will make a fine mash, you\\'re better off with these simple formulas. Try to hit a 2 to 1 ratio of russets to reds (by weight), and have at least 1/4 cup of dairy per pound of potatoes. You may not use it all, but it\\'s good to know it\\'s there. As for the garlic, use your best judgment.Combine potatoes in a large pot and just cover with hot tap water. Place over high heat and season water with 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, (it should taste like sea water). Cover the pot and bring to a boil.Meanwhile, combine dairy and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Keep this mixture barely simmering until the potatoes are done.As soon as the water comes to a boil, remove the lid and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until a potato chunk can easily be crushed with a pair of tongs. Drain, then return potatoes to the pan, return pot to heat and shake for 30 seconds so the surface water can evaporate. Remove pot and set on a towel or hot pads. Pour about half the garlic mixture into the potatoes and mash with an old-fashioned potato masher. Start tasting and looking at the consistency right away. If mashers seem dry or bland, add more of the garlic mixture. Avoid over mashing or you\\'ll end up with gluey instead of fluffyServe straight or garnish with any of the following: parsley, chopped scallions, crumbled bacon, sun dried tomatoes,  (If you have the dry ones, make sure you re-hydrate them.) grated horseradish, horseradish sauce, pesto, more bacon, Sauteed mushrooms...use your imagination."

S'For the meringue: Heat 1-inch water in a 4-quart saucepan, covered, over high heat until it simmers, about 8 minutes. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer.Combine the sugar and whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and set over the simmering water. Whisk continually until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture lightens in color, doubles in volume, and reaches 140 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes.Place the bowl on the stand mixer and, using the whisk attachment, whisk on high until stiff peaks form and the meringue has cooled slightly, approximately 7 minutes. Set aside.To form and cook the oeufs: Place the milk, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and vanilla bean into a 2-quart saucier, cover, and set over high heat. Bring the mixture just to a simmer, approximately 5 minutes. Uncover, decrease the heat to low, and maintain a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees F.Use a 1-1/2 ounce disher to scoop the meringue, 4 at a time, into the milk, and poach for 3 minutes. Gently flip with a slotted spoon and cook until firm to the touch, another 3 minutes. Remove to a tea towel-lined half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining meringue mixture, maintaining the temperature of the milk to make sure it does not boil. Hold the meringues at room temperature until ready to serve, or store in an airtight container over night. (Can be made a day ahead and stored, and kept covered in the refrigerator.) Decrease the heat to low and keep the milk warm in the pan.To finish the neige: Whisk together the egg yolks, kosher salt, and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a medium mixing bowl until well combined and slightly lightened in color, approximately 2 minutes. Slowly add half of the milk mixture, whisking constantly. Return the entire mixture to the saucepan over low heat, and stir frequently with a spatula or wooden spoon until the sauce has thickened slightly and coats the back of the spatula or spoon, 8 to 9 minutes. You should be able to draw a line on the back of the utensil with your finger.Strain the sauce through the fine mesh strainer into a bowl set over an ice water bath and stir until chilled. (Can be made a day ahead and stored, covered in the refrigerator.)To serve: Spoon a small amount of sauce into the center of a shallow bowl and top with 2 oeufs. Sprinkle on pistachios, if desired.'

S'On a clean cutting board, remove the tentacles from the bodies of the squid and reserve. Make sure the tubes are cleaned out and split them open lengthwise so they look like a flat triangle. Using a matte knife, lightly score the squid in a crosshatch pattern. Cut each tube into four pieces of roughly equal size.In a bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of soy sauce with 1 teaspoon of cornstarch and toss the squid in it to coat. Marinate while preparing for the rest of the dish. Combine the miso broth and balsamic vinegar with the remaining cornstarch.In a hot pan or wok, add the sesame oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the squid and cook for 30 to 40 seconds. It will curl up naturally and brown. Working quickly, add the garlic, ginger, and chiles. Allow them to fry for 10 to 15 seconds stirring constantly (they can burn fast). Add the onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper and saute for another minute. Pour in the stock mixture and simmer until the sauce begins to thicken. Season with white pepper and additional soy sauce, if necessary. Serve over rice.'
