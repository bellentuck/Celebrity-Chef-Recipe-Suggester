S'For the salad: In a small bowl, combine the onions, celery leaves, and oil and toss well to coat. Season the salad, to taste, keeping cold until plating.For the sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the pomegranate juice, vinegar, and sugar for 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the cinnamon, and cook for an additional 4 to 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken to almost a syrup consistency. Once reduced, remove the sauce from the heat, whisk in the butter, allowing the butter to fully incorporate into the sauce. Hold at room temperature.For the duck: Place the duck breasts on a cutting board, skin-side down, and slice from top to bottom into 6 or 7 (1/8-inch) thick slices. Season with salt and pepper on both sides, then thread each slice onto a 10-inch wooden skewer in a ribbon fashion. Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat until wisps of smoke appear. Season the duck again with salt and pepper and add to the hot pan, searing on each side for 2 minutes, cooking in batches if necessary.To serve: Place 2 skewers of duck sate over a bed of salad and drizzle with the pomegranate sauce.'

S"To make the teriyaki sauce, heat the rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, and scallions to boiling over medium heat. Let cook for 7 minutes, then whisk in cornstarch slurry and cook for another 3 minutes or so, to allow to thicken. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.Arrange the chicken cubes in a shallow nonreactive container such as a glass baking dish. Season with salt and pepper and rub into the chicken. Pour the sake over the chicken and then pour in the teriyaki sauce. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Begin soaking about 12 bamboo skewers in water so they won\\'t burn on the grill.Heat the grill and thread alternate pieces of chicken and leeks on the skewers. Each skewer should have approximately 3 pieces of chicken, and each serving will consist of 3 skewers. Grill over indirect heat until the chicken is tender but not dry, about 5 to 10 minutes."

S'Microwave lime in a small bowl to release essential oils and set aside until it is just cool enough to handle.Rinse beef to remove any blood residue and pat dry with paper toweling. Rub with salt and pepper and set aside briefly. Combine shallots, garlic, thyme, parsley, sage and olive oil to form a smooth paste. Rub into beef and let sit for a minimum of 2 hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat oil in a large saute pan with an oven safe handle, and sear beef on all sides. Roast in oven until the beef reaches an internal temperature of 125 degrees F, about 20 to 25 minutes, so when you pull it out it will reach 145 degrees F for medium doneness during the carryover cooking while it is resting. (You will be using the pan juices for the lentils, so do not discard them.)While the beef is roasting, rinse lentils in a colander and examine to make sure there are is no foreign material (such as pebbles). Transfer to a saucepot with just enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce and simmer for about 20 minutes until lentils are re-hydrated and water is absorbed, then remove from heat.While lentils are cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and saute white onion until translucent. Add 2 tablespoons butter to the saute pan and when it melts, add shiitake, crimini, and portobello mushrooms to the onion pan along with sage and thyme. Cook mushrooms until they begin to soften and to give up their juices. Stir sauteed onion- mushroom-herb mixture into pot of lentils along with demi-glace. Lower heat and cook for a few minutes to integrate flavors, but do not allow lentils to get mushy. Remove from heat and keep in a warm place.Remove beef from oven and transfer to a utility platter to let rest. Strain pan juices from beef into lentil mixture and stir to combine. Keep covered and warm.Sliced rested beef into thin slices. Stir diced tomato into lentils. Spoon some lentil/mushroom mixture into the center of serving dish and top with beef.

Refrigerate until serving.For the spring rolls: Place the oil in a 1-gallon thick-bottomed saucepan and heat to 350 degrees F. Reduce the heat and hold at 350 degrees F until cooking.In a bowl, mix the cabbage, collard greens, cucumber, onions and sprouts. Season with the salt and pepper, and then blend with the crawfish and pork. Again, mix together.After mixing the filling, place the wrappers on a dry counter with points at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o\\'clock, forming a diamond. After laying out the wrappers, lightly brush the edges with the prepared slurry, then place 1/6 of the filling in the center of the wrapper.Next, bring the bottom point over the filling and press the tip down to seal the 6 o\\'clock point, then repeat with 3 and 9 o\\'clock point and again seal. Once the three points have been sealed, roll tightly from the bottom to top, and repeat the process with the remaining rolls. Next, place the rolls in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to help seal.After refrigerating, place in the fryer and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes, then remove from the oil. Allow to dry over paper towels, then slice in half and serve with the aioli.Chef\\'s Note: Garnish with fried spinach, collard greens or salad."

Reduce heat to low and simmer without stirring until all the sugar has dissolved, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let syrup cool completely. Add the lemon and lime zest, then pour into a shallow baking dish or plastic container and place in the freezer. (The 6 cup capacity shallow plastic containers with a lid that measure 6 inches by 10 inches by 2 inches deep, and which you can get in grocery stores would be ideal for the purpose.)Check after about 2 hours and stir the mixture. After about 4 hours, the mixture will have begun to set up, and you can score the surface by turning a spoon backwards and using the tip to scrape the frozen syrup into "ice curls." Repeat this scraping process periodically, every 2 hours or so, until all of the syrup is scraped into the consistency of water ice. Serve after 8 hours.Arrange the oysters on a bed of ice. Top each oyster with 1/8 teaspoon of wasabi and 1/8 teaspoon caviar. Serve with yuzu granitee.'

S'For the mashed potatoes: Put the potatoes in a large pot with 2 gallons of cold water. Bring the water and potatoes to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender. Strain the potatoes and allow them to rest in the strainer over the sink for 5 to 10 minutes so they steam and dry out a bit. While the potatoes are draining combine the cream and butter in the pot and bring to a boil, melting the butter.Put the potatoes back into the pot with the cream and the butter and whip with an electric hand mixer until the potatoes are smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm. (If the potatoes cool off, heat them in a pan with the additional 1/4 cup cream and 2 tablespoons butter just before plating.)For the vegetables: Prepare a large bowl of ice water for shocking the vegetables after blanching. Bring 2 gallons of water to a rolling boil and add the salt.Add half of the green beans to the boiling water and cook until tender but not over-cooked, about 3 minutes. Transfer the beans to the ice bath using a hand strainer. Allow the water to come back up to a rolling boil and repeat the process with the remainder of the green beans and then the carrots.For the trout: Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat a large skillet over high heat until smoking hot and reduce the heat to medium-high. Season the trout with salt and pepper, then dredge the skin side of the trout in the flour. Coat the skillet with grape seed oil.Place the trout in the skillet skin-side down and sear until the skin is golden brown and the flesh begins to turn opaque. Gently flip the filets over and finish cooking for an additional 2 minutes. Transfer the trout to the prepared baking sheet and allow the cooked trout to rest for 5 minutes.For the sauce: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until they just begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside.Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke. Add the grape seed oil to the pan and then add the shallots and capers. Saute for 2 minutes.Add the lemon juice and bring to a boil; cook until reduced by half. Take the pan off the heat and add the butter a little at a time, swirling the pan to emulsify the butter into the lemon juice. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper (be careful with the salt because the capers can be very salty already). Stir in the chopped parsley.For plating: In a large saute pan over high heat add the carrots and green beans and enough water to create a thin layer in the pan. Allow the water to boil and once the beans and carrots are hot, season them with salt and pepper.Place a scoop of the mashed potatoes in the center of each of 6 plates. Arrange two filets of trout on top, flesh-side up. Arrange the carrots and green beans leaning on the trout to one side.Spoon 2 ounces of sauce onto each plate and sprinkle the toasted almond slices over the top of the fish. Serve immediately.'

S"In a small bowl combine the miso powder with 1 tablespoon of hot water to form a paste. Warm the honey in a microwavable bowl for approximately 1 minute or until hot (be careful, as it can burn quickly). Add the honey to the miso mixture. Put the fish into a resealable plastic bag and add the honey mixture. Seal the bag and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the Chinese long beans and blanch until tender, but not overcooked. Shock the beans in iced water, to stop the cooking and maintain their color. Drain and dry the long beans and either chop into 4 to 6-inch segments or form circles by wrapping the beans around themselves.In a large skillet add the grapeseed oil and heat until smoking hot. Remove the fish from the marinade and sear in hot skillet until the flesh has an opaque color, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the fish from the pan to a large plate and reserve. For the sauce, using the same skillet, over medium heat, add the onion and saute until translucent, then add the chicken stock, ginger and lemongrass and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and strain the liquid, discarding the solids.Return the liquid to a clean skillet, over medium heat. Add the raisins and reduce the liquid by half its volume. Stir in the butter cubes and whisk until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and allow to rest until needed.Heat a little grapeseed oil in a medium skillet, over medium heat, and add the long bean circles or strips and saute until golden brown.To serve, arrange 2 long bean circles in the middle of each plate. Top the beans with a fish fillet and drizzle with the sauce. Garnish with cilantro and lemon.Cook\\'s Note: to make this dish extra special, you could make a horseradish relish to go on top."

Pour into a stainless steel bowl and allow it to cool to 200 degrees F.While the syrup is cooling, push a wooden stick into each apple from the top through the core. The stick should be deep enough so it won\\'t fall off when you dip the apple into the caramel.Line a cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat or waxed paper.Dip each apple into the 200 degrees F caramel, watching carefully, so as not to dip your fingers into the caramel. Remove the excess caramel by turning the apples over the caramel bowl and then transfer to the cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining apples. Chill for 15 minutes, then remove them from the silicon mat or waxed paper. Transfer to a serving platter and serve.Cook\\'s Note: This is a fun project for children, but they must be supervised by an adult at all times.

S'Bring 4 cups of water to boil and add rice and 2 teaspoons salt to the water. Return to a boil, reduce heat, cover and let cook without removing cover, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes.While the rice is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat in a large saute pan and saute the onion until it begins to turn translucent. Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper and sear each side, beginning the skin side first, leaving each side undisturbed for the first 2 minutes or so to allow the flavors to integrate into the surface of the fish and for the caramelization process to begin. Cook further until the fish flakes, approximately another 6 to 8 minutes, remove from heat and let rest. Heat oil in deep fryer to 375 degrees F or according to the manufacturer\\\'s directions for similar food.Mix rice, crab boil seasoning, mayonnaise, parsley and lemon juice. Fold in flaked salmon and form into 3/4-inch diameter "cocktail size" balls.To make tempura, mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, chopped chives in a bowl and add seltzer in a stream while whisking constantly. Season with salt and pepper. Place salmon balls on a slotted spoon and, holding over the bowl, ladle some tempura batter over each. Transfer to the deep-fryer basket and fry until golden.Combine all the Dipping Sauce ingredients and serve with the fritters.'

S'To cook en papillote (on the grill, enclosed in foil), preheat grill to medium-high heat.Rinse beef to remove any unwanted smells, pat dry with paper toweling and season with garlic powder and salt and pepper, and set aside briefly. Make an oven pouch out of a 3 foot length of heavy duty foil by bringing the 2 ends to the center, folding the sides to seal, and leaving an opening at the top center through which to place the sauce and beef. Shake flour in the pouch to coat the inside. Sear all sides of beef on the grill, then put beef in pouch and pour 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce and 1 tablespoon of the hot sauce over the meat (reserving the rest of the barbeque sauce and hot sauce). Seal the foil pouch by folding shut. Grill bagged beef directly on grill for about 30 minutes per pound. Ideally this should be cooked until fork tender, so that you can pull it apart with a fork.Let beef rest 10 minutes before carving into thin slices, or pulling it apart with a fork. Heat the reserved barbeque sauce and hot sauce in a small saucepan. Then chop or shred the sliced beef and serve on Kaiser rolls or crusty Italian rolls. Spoon a bit of the extra sauce over the meat.'

Remove pot from the heat and let syrup cool completely. Add the lemon, orange zest, mint leaves, and pour into a shallow baking dish or plastic container and place in the freezer. (The 6 cup capacity shallow plastic containers with a lid that measure 6 inches by 10 inches by 2 inches deep, and which you can get in grocery stores would be ideal for the purpose.)Check after about 2 hours and stir the mixture. After about 4 hours, the mixture will have begun to set up, and you can score the surface by turning a spoon backwards and using the tip to scrape the frozen syrup into "ice curls." Repeat this scraping process periodically, every 2 hours or so, until all of the syrup is scraped into the consistency of water ice. Serve after 8 hours.'

Season with salt and pepper.For the pork chops: Sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper. Add some oil to a hot saute pan and sear the chops for about 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F, another 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, drain off any excess oil and deglaze with the Madeira, leaving the pork in the pan. Return to the heat and cook off the alcohol for about 2 minutes.

Next, add the flour and oil and mix until smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Oil a baking sheet. Portion the dough into two rounds and place on the baking sheet. Allow to rest and rise until doubling in size, about 1 hour.Working with one ball of dough at a time, spread the dough evenly, forming a crust about 13 inches in diameter. Transfer to a round pan and allow to rise for 30 minutes; repeat with the other dough ball.Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.For the pizzas: After rising, "dock" each crust with your fingertip to form small pockets in the dough, 20 to 30 pockets on each. Pour about 2 ounces of sauce over each crust to cover the dough and fill the pockets. Bake for 20 minutes to form the crust and allow the sauce to dry into the dough.Raise the oven temperature to 450 degrees F.Evenly spread the remaining sauce to cover the cooked crusts, leaving a 1/2-inch border unsauced. Next, spread 2 ounces of cheese over the sauce on each pizza, followed by the toppings. Finish with a sprinkling of more cheese. Bake until the cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes.'

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat and add the antelope. Saute the antelope until browned, stirring throughout the cooking process. After browning, deglaze with 4 cups of port or red wine, then add the stock, thyme, garlic, bay leaves, rosemary and potatoes. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer until the meat is tender, about 40 to 50 minutes.In separate pan, over medium heat, add remaining butter, the onion, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring, for 5 to 6 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the remaining 1 cup of wine, then add the tomato paste, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the vegetable mixture into the meat mixture and simmer for an additional 40 to 50 minutes, depending on the thickness of the stew. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

S'For the cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and lay parchment paper over the bottom of a jelly roll size baking pan (17 1/2 by 11 1/2  by 1-inch deep). With an electric beater, beat together the egg yolks, just 1/4 cup of the sugar (reserving the rest), and vanilla until the mixture becomes a pale yellow and thickens. Sift cake flour over the egg yolk mixture and set aside briefly. Wash and dry the beaters. In a separate metal bowl, beat the egg whites, gradually beating in the balance of the sugar until stiff peaks form. To the egg yolk/flour bowl, fold in one-third of the beaten egg whites until just barely combined. Repeat two more times with each of the remaining two thirds of the beaten egg whites. Spread into baking pan and bake in oven for about 15 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and springs back when touched. Let cake cool in pan.While the cake is cooling, it would be a good idea to make room in the freezer for the sheet cake.When the cake is completely cool, peel off the browned surface of the cake. (You can do this simply by loosening it and rolling it off.)Then prepare the ice cream by cutting each 1/2 gallon crosswise into 7 even-sized bricks, a total of 14 bricks. The typical rectangular carton of ice cream measures 63/4 inches long by 5 inches wide by 3 inches tall. You will arrange these bricks 4 across and 3 lengthwise on top of the sheet cake, cutting the leftover bricks to size to fit in any areas of the cake that are not covered by the ice cream. You will need to work quickly to keep the ice cream from melting. (If the ice cream is allowed to melt, its texture will not be optimal when the cake is frozen.) Cut the ice cream covered cake into rectangles which are approximately 3 inches square (a count of 4 across the width of the sheet cake and 6 along the length of the cake). This will yield 24 rectangles for 12 servings of 2 petit fours each. As you cut, you will need to remove 1 row and 1 length of the cake squares to another platter. Then use the knife to gently separate all the ice cream covered the squares, allowing enough space between them so that you will be able to thoroughly coat each piece with chocolate.Put all the ice cream covered cake into the space you have reserved in the freezer. Let freeze for about an hour.The chocolate to coat the cake and ice cream will be tempered, a term used to describe the successive melting and cooling of the chocolate within a certain temperature range. This process allows the molecules of the chocolate to align so that it will retain a silky appearance without a chalky finish. To temper the chocolate, place half of the semisweet chocolate pieces in each of 2 stainless steel bowls which will fit over a saucepan double-boiler fashion. Bring an inch or so of water to a boil in the saucepan and fit 1 of the bowls of chocolate pieces over it and heat until just melted (no more than 120 degrees F on the candy thermometer). Then pour this just-melted chocolate into the other bowl with the un-melted chocolate, melt and stir to combine until chocolate reaches between 86 and 90 degrees F. Remove the tray of ice cream covered cake from the freezer and work quickly to spoon the chocolate over the ice cream and cake before the chocolate hardens. Completely coat each piece with chocolate and return to freezer. Return to freezer and remove from tray with a thin bladed spatula to serve.'

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil.Add the flour to a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper, to taste. In another shallow dish, combine the eggs and the milk and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Dip the eggplant slices into flour, and then into the egg mixture.Fry the eggplant, in batches, in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides. Remove the eggplant to paper towels to drain. Repeat until all the eggplant has been fried.For the stuffing:In a large bowl combine the 3 cheeses, parsley and the 2 beaten eggs. Mix well and season with salt and pepper, to taste. The mixture should be a little wet, so add enough bread crumbs to make a dry mixture that will not stick to your hands.Lay the eggplant slices on a flat surface and divide the filling between the slices. Roll up and arrange in a lightly greased ovenproof dish. Refrigerate for 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For quick tomato sauce:Add the canola oil to a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the garlic and onions and saute until golden brown.Stir in the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat and continue to cook at a simmer for another 15 minutes. Add the basil and the butter and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.To finish the dish:Remove the eggplant from the refrigerator, top with the fresh tomato sauce and bake until the eggplant is cooked through and the sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes.'

Coat the pan with 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil, and then place three burger patties in the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook until the patties are seared on the first side. Flip, and cook on the reverse side until the sausage patties are cooked through and the beef patties have reached the desired doneness.

Allow the burgers to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before plating.For the fajita-spiced peppers and onions: Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke. Reduce the heat to medium and swirl in the grapeseed oil. Add the peppers and onions and saute until tender.In a small bowl, mix together the chili powder, oregano, coriander, salt, cumin, black pepper and cayenne until well blended. Add the spice mixture to the peppers and onions and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes.For the corn salsa: Combine the corn, crema, red onions, poblanos, cilantro, honey and lime juice in a bowl and mix well.

Top each breast with some marinara sauce and a slice of cheese.Place the chicken on a sheet tray and then put it in the oven. Take out the chicken when the cheese melts.In another pan set over medium-high heat, add some oil. Add the garlic and saute, followed by the broccoli rabe. Toss the two together in the pan.

S"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Heat a deep saute pan over medium heat. Add the oil and allow to heat. Add the beef and pork to the oil, stirring to cook until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Then add the tomato, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper, and reduce the heat to low and cook for additional 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. Carefully strain into a bowl. Transfer the meat mixture to a clean bowl. Allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes. (Mixture must be cool before adding to the pastry.) While the mixture cools, roll out the puff pastry.For the roulade: Sprinkle some flour on your counter or cutting board. Lay the sheet of pastry over the flour. With a rolling pin, roll the pastry out from the center, from the top to the bottom, and then out to the sides to make it a large rectangle, about 1 1/2 times the original size.Stir the egg yolks and breadcrumbs into the cooled meat mixture, stirring in well.Place half the cooled meat mixture onto the bottom third of the pastry sheet, keeping the bottom 2 inches empty. Top with half the Cheddar and goat cheeses and roll tightly. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the pastry with a light coating of whisked egg whites. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and half the Parmesan. Repeat with the second piece of pastry.Place the roulades on a sheet pan covered with parchment. Bake in the oven until golden brown, 16 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes.For the sauce: In a small bowl, stir the chopped onion and ketchup together.To serve: Slice the roulades into thin rounds and serve warm with a dollop of sauce on each slice.Chef\\'s NotesKeep the puff pastry in the fridge until you\\'re ready to use it. If the pastry gets too warm and soft while you\\'re rolling it out, just chill it for a minute before proceeding.Make sure that the meat mixture is cooled before adding to the pastry."

S'For the sausage gravy: Heat a pan over high heat, add the oil and then add the sausage. Brown the sausage, stirring and breaking up the large chunks, until cooked through. Add the chile powder, thyme and cayenne and saute for 1 minute. Stir in the flour to make a roux. Slowly stir in the milk and bring the gravy to a simmer. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring so the sauce does not burn. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.For the vegetables: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Toss the potatoes in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until tender and browned, 20 to 25 minutes.Heat a large saute pan over high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the potatoes, tomatoes and garlic to the pan and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the kale to the pan and saute to wilt the kale. Add a little water to help with the wilting if needed. Season with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice.For the trout: Season the trout with the salt and pepper.Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the oil to the skillet and then gently place the fish flesh-side down in the skillet. Sear the fish on the flesh side for 2 to 3 minutes and then flip and cook until the skin is crispy and the flesh is fully cooked, another 2 to 3 minutes. Allow the fish to rest briefly before serving.For plating: Divide the vegetables among 6 plates, lay the fish (flesh-side up) over the vegetables and then spoon the sausage gravy over the top of the fish.'

S'Bring a large pot with 8 cups water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, add the potatoes and cook until fork soft, 12 to 15 minutes. Once cooked, remove the pot from the stove, drain the potatoes into a colander and allow to completely drain.While the potatoes are cooking, preheat a grill to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the steaks with salt and black pepper, and begin cooking on the grill. Cook the first side 2 to 3 minutes, then flip to the second side and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. After the second side is cooked, flip back to the first side, cook 2 to 3 more minutes and then finish on the second side for a final 2 to 3 minutes for medium-rare to medium. This "four side" cooking will result in evenly grilled and cooked steaks. After the final cooking, remove from the grill and spoon the clarified butter over the steaks. Allow to rest until serving, 3 to 5 minutes. The butter will help the steaks stay at the present grilled temperature.To finish, add the drained potatoes to a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whisk until the potatoes are broken down, 1 to 2 minutes.

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a large heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat add 1/4 cup of oil and heat until smoking.  Add the diced bacon and cook until crisp. Remove from the pan and drain well on paper towels.  Set aside.Season the chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in flour, beginning with the chicken drumstick.  Reserve leftover flour.Put them into the hot bacon oil and sear until golden brown and continue this method for the chicken thighs, and then the breast.  When all is done, remove from the saucepan to a plate and add the garlic and onions and continue to cook until onions are translucent.  Stir in remainder of the flour, to make a roux.Add the tomato paste and stir over low heat. Gradually begin to add the wine and stock until the sauce begins to thicken, stirring constantly. Repeat the process until all the wine and stock have been used, (if more liquid is needed add cold water).Return all the seared chicken to the saucepan, add the fresh herbs, pearl onions, carrots and mushrooms and bake in the oven until the chicken is thoroughly cooked, about 1 hour. Remove the pan from the oven, and transfer the chicken to a serving platter, then put the saucepan over low heat.  Reduce the sauce for about 20 minutes and remove any excess fat.Return the chicken to the sauce and reheat for 3 minutes.  To finish, garnish with the reserved bacon and freshly chopped parsley.'

Remove the ham from the oven and score the skin in a diamond pattern. Spoon the glaze over, spreading to coat completely. Return the ham to the oven and bake for about 30 minutes longer.Chef\\'s Note: To make really special, take small can pineapple rings, drain syrup and place pineapple rings on top of the glazed ham. Secure the pineapple to the ham with wooden cocktail sticks. Then take small jar of cocktail cherries and place 1 cherry in the center of each pineapple ring and continue to baste with the glaze during the cooking process. This makes a good looking ham for a summer buffet table."

S"In a skillet, bring 1 cup of water and the brandy to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Peel the pears with a vegetable peeler, cut in half lengthwise and remove the core, the stem and the fibers that run down the center. Slice lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices and add to the simmering brandy mixture. (Add enough hot water to cover the pears, if necessary.) Poach for about 10 minutes, remove from heat and let cool to room temperature while you are preparing the batter.For the cake:Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Oil the bottom of a 9 by 2-inch deep round pan and lay parchment paper over the bottom. Then brush a thin layer of canola oil on top of the parchment paper. Sift cake flour and cocoa powder together several times to aerate. In a separate heatproof bowl combine the eggs and sugar. Nest the bowl with the sugar and eggs in another larger bowl filled with about 2-inches hot water. Whisk together the eggs and sugar, being very careful not to splash any water into it. The idea here is to raise the temperature of the egg and sugar mixture to between 100 and 120 degrees F. Use a candy thermometer to test the temperature. Once the mixture is warmed, remove the bowl from the water bowl and use an electric beater to beat it until it is about triple in volume and is the consistency of soft whipped cream. Sift the 1/3 of the flour and cocoa powder into the bowl of beaten eggs and sugar, and fold together. Repeat for each remaining 1/3 of the flour mixture, folding together after each addition. Then, gently fold in the melted butter and vanilla. Drain the pear slices and arrange them in the bottom of the cake pan. Overlap them in a pattern of concentric circles. Pour batter over layer of pears, spreading evenly, but don\\'t fill pan any more than within 1/2-inch of the top edge of the pan. Bang pan on countertop - 1 or 2 times only - to make sure the batter sinks down between the pears, but don\\'t overdo it or you will undo all your hard work in aerating the batter! Bake in oven until the surface springs back when touched and a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cake cool in pan 10 minute to allow set up, then using oven mitts, press a serving plate firmly on the top edges of the pan, and invert the cake onto the plate. Replace any pear slices that become dislodged. This cake can be served warm or at room temperature."

Heat grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in an oven safe pan, preferably with a lid. Sear pork loin on all sides, leaving each side undisturbed for the first few minutes before turning, to allow the seasonings to integrate into the surface of the meat. Cover the pan and transfer to the oven. Roast, covered, until fork tender, about 1 1/2 hours, or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove cover and increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F for about 10 minutes to allow outside of roast to brown. Remove from oven and allow to rest and carryover cook to 170 degrees F. Slice.For the marmalade: While the pork is in the oven, make the marmalade. Heat grapeseed oil over medium heat in a small skillet. Add onion and reduce heat to low. Allow to slowly caramelize, about 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in ketchup and salt and pepper, to taste, and allow to cook for another 10 minutes to reduce and thicken.

S'Press the rice cereal treat mixture evenly into a 13 by 9 by 2-inch pan coated with cooking spray. When cooled, cut into 12 pieces by cutting into thirds lengthwise and fourths crosswise. Heat milk in a saucepan over low heat. Stir in sugar until it dissolves. Stirring constantly, add caramel topping until all ingredients are mixed and becomes a sauce. The sauce will be a consistency into which you will be able to fold in the bananas without mashing them, but is still thick. If necessary, use instant flour to thicken. Slice bananas into the sauce and fold in gently.Spoon bananas and caramel sauce over rice cereal treats. Top with mini-marshmallows and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.'

S'For the puree, boil cauliflower in salted water until very tender. Drain well, stir in heavy cream, and puree with an immersion blender. Add cubed butter and further blend to smooth out the puree. Season, to taste, with salt and white pepper and keep warm.For the sauce, simmer beer, shallot, 1 tablespoon of the hops (reserving the rest), thyme, and white pepper until the liquid is reduced by half. Strain and allow to cool to room temperature.Add the egg yolks to a double boiler fitted over a pan of barely simmering water. (In order to avoid making scrambled eggs, the water level should not touch the bottom of the double boiler bowl.) Begin beating the egg yolks with a whip and add 1 tablespoon of the beer reduction. Beat until the yolks are thick, about 5 minutes. Crumble the remaining hops into the reduction to intensify the flavor.Remove the entire double boiler assembly (pot and all) to a heatproof surface like a large cutting board. Lift the double boiler from the pot and place a clean damp kitchen towel over the pot, tuck the loose ends of the towel under the base of the pot, and return the double boiler bowl to its position so that it sits atop the damp towel. Pour some of the clarified butter into the bowl in a slow steady stream while whisking constantly. As the mixture thickens, alternate some of the beer reduction with the butter, until all of the butter and the reduction are emulsified. Add the cayenne pepper and lemon juice. Add salt, if needed. Adjust the thickness of the sauce by beating in additional warm water. Set aside in a warm area until ready to use. (Please note that this sauce cannot be made in advance, so try to time it as closely as possible to serving time.)Heat the grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper and sear flesh-side down first, leaving undisturbed for the first few minutes to allow the caramelization process to begin and to prevent tearing of the flesh. To complement the taste of the beer reduction, it would be desirable to put a hard sear on the salmon, which means leaving it to sear until it is a dark (but not burnt) golden brown. Flip the fish and sear the other side the same way. Remove from heat to let rest and cover to carryover cook until it flakes.Spoon some cauliflower puree on plate. Top with a piece of salmon, some sauce, and a sprig of chervil.'

Stir in the tomato paste and flour and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Add the wine and the beef broth. Return the turkey legs to the pan and continue to cook until tender, about 1 hour. For the creamed corn:While waiting for the legs to cook, begin the creamed corn. Add the butter to a saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until they become translucent. Using a sharp knife remove the corn kernels from the cob. Add the kernels to the sauteed onions and continue to cook until the corn becomes tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and reduce the cream, until the mixture forms a thick sauce around the corn. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste, and set aside until needed.Once the turkey legs are cooked and the meat is really tender, remove them from the liquid to a platter. Reduce the cooking liquid over medium heat until it coats the back of a spoon. Add the bay leaves and the fresh herbs and allow to infuse for about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove the bay leaves.Arrange a turkey leg on each serving plate and cover with the cooking liquid. Spoon some of the creamed corn alongside and serve.'

S'Add the vinegar and lemon juice to a blender. Replace the lid, turn on the blender, and through the feed opening, add, 1 at a time, the garlic, salt, and black pepper. Leaving the blender running add the olive oil in a slow thin stream.Place the mushrooms and chicken breasts in separate nonreactive bowls suitable for marinating and pour half of the marinade mixture over the contents of each container. Add the sliced red onion to the container with the chicken. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.Begin making the warm potato salad. Boil potatoes until tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fry the bacon and drain on paper towels. Add the balsamic vinegar to a blender, replace the lid, and through the feed opening, add, 1 at a time, the dill, mustard, honey, pepper, and salt. Leaving the blender running, add the olive oil in a slow thin stream. Drain the potatoes well, add the scallions, crumble in the bacon, and fold in enough of the dressing to coat.Heat the grill and grill marinated Portobello, skin side down first for about 5 minutes over indirect heat. Flip and grill the other side. Remove from heat and let rest. Grill both sides of marinated chicken, about 5 minutes per side, and transfer to a baking sheet.Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a small bowl, mash together the butter, breadcrumbs, sage, parsley, thyme and salt and pepper, to taste. Chop grilled mushrooms finely and combine with butter/breadcrumb mixture to make a paste. Press onto surface of chicken breasts and finish in oven until crust turns golden brown, about 2 to 5 minutes.Arrange warm potato salad and crusted chicken breast on plate and sprinkle with parsley.'

In a large oven proof skillet add canola oil and heat until it gets to the smoking point. Add garlic and onions and saute until cooked, tossing quickly so as not to burn the garlic. Remove from pan and set aside. In the same pan with the oil residue, add the butter and place the disks of the testicles, flat side down, into the hot skillet. Cook until golden brown on both sides. Add the wine, stir in tomato paste until well incorporated, then add back the sauteed onion and garlic mixture. As the dish cooks it will thicken because of the flour dusting on the testicles. Continue to cook on top of the range for about 15 minutes, then place the pan into the preheated oven for another 30 minutes or until testicles are tender. Remove from oven and adjust seasoning. Let rest for approximately 10 minutes so flavor enhances. Garnish with chopped herbs and crispy bread.'

S"For the Chicken: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Steam spinach and let cool. Lay a long piece of plastic wrap over your cutting board and tuck it underneath the sides of the board. The chicken breasts should be placed on the covered cutting board, skin side down, with enough space between them so they can lay flat after you butterfly them. To make the butterfly cut, carefully slice open (without slicing the chicken all the way through) and spread the flesh of the chicken out so you will be able to pound it out into a single thin piece on which you will place stuffing and then roll up. Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Then put another length of plastic wrap over the seasoned chicken breasts and flatten with meat mallet to integrate the seasoning into the chicken. *Cook\\'s Note:  Covering the chicken with the plastic will also keep the mess down when you pound with the meat mallet.Pound chicken thin and remove plastic. In a small mixing bowl, mix together, blue cheese, ricotta cheese, Parmesan, lemon zest and white wine. Place equal amounts of the cheese mixture on each breast, followed by equal amounts of the steamed spinach. Fold in each end and roll tightly, securing with toothpicks as needed, and placing on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and brush with remaining olive oil. Place in the oven (leaving an oven rack available for the hash) and roast for 45 to 50 minutes, or until internal temperature registers 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove stuffed chicken from oven and allow to rest.For the tapenade: Finely chop olives and plums and combine with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add 2 ounces of blue cheese and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.For the Hash: In a large oven-safe skillet, add half the oil (1/4 cup) and warm the pan over medium low heat. Add the pieces of blanched asparagus and diced onion, and saute together for about 5 minutes until the asparagus feels cooked to the bite. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large bowl toss the zucchini, diced white potatoes and diced sweet potatoes with the remaining 1/4 cup of oil and season them with salt and pepper. Get a nice even coating of oil on the zucchini and potatoes and place them onto a large roasting tray. Top with the asparagus and onion mixture and place in the oven for 35 to 45 minutes.  For the Demi-Glace: Prepare demi-glace while the chicken and hash are in the oven, by melting the butter over medium heat in a saucepan and sauteing onion until tender. Whisk together cornstarch and red wine to make slurry, and add to onion along with veal stock. Let simmer over medium heat until reduced by 1/3, stirring occasionally.Once the hash is complete, toss 2 ounces of blue cheese with warm hash mixture and using a 3-inch circle mold or biscuit cutter as a mold, form a circle of the hash in the center of serving plate. Place stuffed chicken on top of hash, and spoon some of the tapenade onto the chicken breast. Drizzle demi-glace over chicken and hash."

S'Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. ("Proofing" the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn\\\'t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes.Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to an hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time.While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza topping. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium high heat in a large sauce pan and saute garlic and onions. Add parsley, salt, tomatoes, and basil. Cook for about 20 minutes to allow flavors to integrate. Mix with an immersion blender, then set aside briefly.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Divide the dough in half and stretch out 2 (14-inch) circles. Transfer them to pizza stones sprinkled with cornmeal. Top with the tomato sauce as you would a pizza topping.  Lay an even amount of mozzarella cheese slices on each. Roll up and seal ends. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the dough is nicely browned.'

Continue to cook for another 4 minutes, then add the heavy cream, chocolate and the fresh chopped rosemary leaves. Add the cooked duck breasts to the sauce, then remove the pan from the heat and let rest for 5 minutes.Meanwhile in another skillet, over medium heat, add 1/2 of the butter and a little oil. When hot, add the cabbage and saute until tender. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. Finish the sauce by adding the remaining butter. Whisk well and adjust seasoning, if necessary. To serve, spoon some of the cabbage in the center of each plate and top with a duck breast. Ladle a little of the sauce on top of the duck and serve.'

S'Bring a pot of water to boiling for the pasta. Cook the pasta until al dente and drain well so that you don\\\'t have excess cooking water which will dilute the flavor. While the pasta is cooking, melt the grapeseed oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and add the onion and garlic, cooking until translucent, being careful not to burn. Add the flour a little at a time to make a roux. Do this gradually because some batches of flour absorb more than others and you may not need as much. Add the bay leaves, and then incorporate the vegetable stock a little at a time to form a smooth sauce. Simmer for at least 10 minutes to allow the flour to "cook out," then remove the bay leaves. Add the heavy cream and Cheddar cheese, then season with salt and white pepper. Fold in as much pasta as you need to acquire the right consistency for macaroni and cheese. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with chopped chives.'

S'Rinse chicken breasts and pat them dry with paper toweling. Rub with Cajun spice and set aside.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Melt butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet or saute pan with an oven safe handle, and saute scallions and mushrooms until they are tender and the mushrooms begin to give up their juices. With a slotted spoon remove mushrooms and scallions to a utility platter and keep covered (with aluminum foil or a lid) in a warm place. (Leave room on the platter for the chicken.) Add seasoned chicken to the skillet, searing all sides.  Deglaze the pan with white wine, let sizzle for a few minutes and spoon the wine and juices over the chicken to coat, and then cover pan and transfer to oven. Bake until fork tender, about 25 minutes.While the chicken is in the oven, heat the mushroom soup in a small saucepan and whisk in demi-glace to give it additional flavor. Cover and let simmer over low heat.Remove chicken from oven (be sure to use an oven mitt - the handle on that pan will be hot!) and use tongs to transfer the chicken to the utility platter (alongside the mushroom mixture). Cover and keep warm.Add about 1/2 cup water to the pan in which the chicken was baking and stir to loosen the browned bits of flavor on the bottom. Place a strainer over the pot of mushroom soup and demi-glace and (still using an oven mitt for that hot handle) pour the juice from the chicken pan through the strainer into the sauce. Whisk together the sauce and pan juices and let cook for a few more minutes to integrate flavors.Place chicken on serving dish. Spoon sauce over.

S'Special equipment: a frying thermometerFor the rosemary garlic French fries: Leaving the skin on, cut the potatoes into fries that are 1/4-inch thick and 1/4-inch wide and as long as the potato. As soon as they are cut, transfer the fries into a deep container that will hold them all and run cold water over the top. Run the water until the water overflowing out of the container runs clear.In a 2-gallon pot, heat the oil to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Strain the potatoes and pat dry.In batches, fry the french fries plus 4 to 6 garlic cloves until the fries are tender but do not have color, about 4 minutes. Transfer to the lined baking sheet and allow the oil to drain off. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.When ready to serve, heat the oil up to 350 degrees F. Fry the french fries and the garlic until the fries are golden brown and crispy, 7 to 8 minutes. With about 30 seconds left of cooking, add the rosemary sprigs. Transfer the fries and garlic to a bowl, season with salt and pepper and toss. Remove the rosemary sprigs.For the apple chutney: In a saute pan over high heat melt the butter. Add the onions and saute until caramelized and brown, about 15 minutes. Add the apples and saute until the apples are tender. Add the cinnamon and chopped thyme and saute for 1 minute.Add the vinegar and brown sugar and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the chutney until the liquid reduces by half and glazes the apples, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.For the ham steaks: Heat a skillet on high heat until smoking hot and reduce the heat to medium-high. Season the ham steaks with pepper. Coat the skillet with the oil.Place the ham steaks in the skillet and cook until the first side is seared. Flip the steaks and add 1 cup water to the skillet. Cover and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow them to rest.For plating: Arrange the ham steaks in the center of 6 plates. Top the steaks with 3 to 4 ounces of the apple chutney, then top with piles of the rosemary-garlic fries.'

Through the feed opening of a running blender add, one at a time, the papaya, papaya seeds, Dijon mustard, vinegar, salt, pepper, and juice from the microwaved lemon. (Note: If you squeeze the lemon with the sliced side against your palm, the seeds are likely to stay in the rind.) Then with the blender still running, add the olive oil in a slow thin stream. Please note that the edible papaya seeds lend a wonderful mustard-y taste to the dressing, but are coarse in texture. If you find the texture to be too coarse for you, strain the dressing before use. Toss the greens, cucumber, tomatoes and papaya strings with enough of the dressing to coat, serving additional dressing on the side.'

Peel hard-boiled eggs and chill.Fry bacon and drain on paper towels.For the vinaigrette: Through the feed opening of a running blender add, 1 at a time, the vinegar, pomegranate seeds, honey, salt and pepper. Leaving the blender running, add the olive oil in a slow, thin stream. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and set aside until needed.For the tempura and sandwiches: Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F, or as directed in manufacturer\\'s instructions for similar foods. In a mixing bowl large enough to accommodate the stuffed sandwiches, combine flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Add seltzer water in a stream while whisking constantly. Dip the stuffed sandwiches in the batter to coat. Add, 1 at a time, to the deep-fryer basket which has been immersed in the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and drain on paper towels.Chop eggs and gently toss with spinach, crumbled bacon, and avocado with enough of the dressing to coat.Arrange salad on plates with tempura fried stuffed sandwiches."

Any extra mole sauce can be drizzled over the scoops of potato/cauliflower to look like chocolate sauce. Spoon some tomatoes on serving plate along with syrup to look like cherries jubilee.An effective presentation is to place the meatloaf on a large serving platter, spoon the re-warmed strained mole sauce over to cover the crust of the meatloaf, then remove 1 wedge of the meatloaf to expose the layered interior, laying that wedge on its side next to the rest of the cake. Your individual serving plate will be arranged with scoops of the potato/cauliflower, topped with mole sauce if desired, and some grape tomatoes with syrup spooned over and around. Serve the rest of the meatloaf wedges to your guests at the table.'

S'For the chicken: Melt butter over medium heat in a medium saute pan. Add crawfish and season with salt and pepper. Saute until they begin to turn opaque. Deglaze pan with the brandy and allow most of the liquid to evaporate. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Stir in shrimp paste, mayonnaise, queso panela, Parmesan and bread crumbs. Lay chicken breasts out, spoon 2 tablespoons of the mixture onto each chicken breast and fold to enclose stuffing. Secure with toothpicks. Dip each stuffed chicken breast into egg mixture and roll in seasoned flour.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Heat grapeseed oil over medium heat in an ovenproof skillet. Sear chicken, leaving each side undisturbed for the first few minutes to let the flour integrate into the surface of the chicken and to prevent crusting off. Transfer pan to oven and bake until chicken is fork tender, about 35 minutes.For the sauce: Bring chicken stock, cloves, nutmeg, and bay leaf to a simmer in a small saucepan. In a separate small saucepan saute the shallot in butter over medium heat until it turns translucent. Add flour to make a roux. Whisk in brandy and let cook for about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the chicken stock mixture and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Reduce heat to low and let simmer for about 15 minutes to let flavors integrate and to thicken.For the salsa: Heat salsa and add arrowroot to thicken.Remove toothpicks from stuffed chicken and place in center of serving plate. Spoon about 1 tablespoon sauce over each chicken breast and top with salsa.'

S'Special equipment: One 10-pound bag self-lighting charcoal, 1 new steel trash can, one 2-to-3-foot metal stack or metal spit, 1 roll heavy-duty aluminum foilTo brine the turkey, thoroughly clean the trash can with food-grade cleaner. Dry. Then add 3 gallons water, the salt, pepper, herbs and turkey. Finally, squeeze the lemons into the brine. Add some ice and allow the turkey to brine for 12 to 24 hours, re-icing during the process to keep temperature below 40 degrees F. This brining is optional.To cook the bird, remove from the brine and pat dry with towels. Or, for the non-brine option, remove the bird from the package, pat dry with towels, and apply the salt and pepper to the exterior of the bird.Next, place foil on level ground to form a 3-foot-square area. Place a stake in the ground and place the turkey on the stake, legs first. Cover the turkey with the trash can and apply half the coals on top of can with the remainder tightly around the base of the can.Light the coals evenly and allow the coals to warm until hot, then set the timer for 90 minutes and relax.After 90 minutes, carefully remove the coals with a turner or fireplace shovel and uncover. Remove the turkey and allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving.'

S'Early in the day prepare the pork loin and marinade. Rinse pork loin to remove any unwanted smells and pat dry with paper toweling. Remove pork to a nonreactive container. Place the limes and lemons in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since these will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set them aside briefly, until they cool just enough to handle. Blend the garlic cloves and the garlic pepper seasoning in a blender, then while the blender is still running, squeeze the juice of the limes and lemons through the feed tube to make a paste. With the blender still running, add the oil in a thin stream. Rub the paste into the pork, cover and leave refrigerated for 2 hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large saute pan with an oven safe handle, heat the oil and sear the pork loin on all sides. Roast covered in oven until fork tender, at least 45 minutes. Transfer pork to a utility platter and let rest in a warm place before slicing. The pork can also be cooked on the grill. Heat grill to medium-high heat. Wrap pork in a foil pouch in which you have shaken 1 tablespoon flour, and cook over indirect heat (on the side of the grill opposite the direct heat source) for about 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours. Let pork rest before slicing. While the pork is cooking, prepare the aioli. Add peaches, mayonnaise, and cilantro to a food processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt and white pepper, to taste.Lay slices of pork loin on rolls and spoon peach aioli over. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.'

Turn on the blender and through the feed-tube, add the parsley, chives, honey, rice wine vinegar, and fresh ginger, and blend together until a smooth paste has formed. At this point the limes should be cool enough to squeeze. With the power on, add the lime juice through the blender feed-tube, and then very slowly add the oil and water until the mixture thickens and can coat the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside in refrigerator until needed. (When chilled, the dressing should resemble something like mayonnaise.)

S'For the bubble and squeak: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Add the cabbage to a pan, cover with chicken stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until tender, about 1 hour.Drizzle the squash halves with the oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and put on a baking sheet cut-side up. Roast until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Set aside to cool.Put the potatoes in a pot and add enough salted water to cover. Cover the pot, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and mash with a fork or potato masher.For the steaks: In a bowl, mix together the parsley, salt, pepper and lemon and lime juice. In a shallow bowl, cover the steaks with the sauce and marinate for 30 minutes.Measure out 2 cups of the mashed potatoes, 1 cup of the cooked cabbage and 1 cup of the roasted squash into a large bowl (save the remaining vegetables for another use). Add the egg and some salt and pepper and mix well. Form into four equal cakes, each about 1 inch thick.To cook the cakes, heat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add some butter and then the cakes and cook until golden brown on one side. Flip and cook on the second side until golden brown. Keep warm.For the poached eggs: Heat 8 cups water and the vinegar in a pot until simmering. Carefully crack the eggs into the water and cook for 3 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and place on a plate or into soup cups until plating.To cook the steaks, heat a thick-bottom pan over high heat until smoking. Remove the steaks from the marinade. Reduce the heat to medium, add the oil and steaks and cook for 3 minutes on each side. Set the steaks aside on a plate to rest for 2 minutes. Add the Sriracha to the pan and stir to create a pan sauce. Slice the steaks on the bias.Place a bubble and squeak cake on each plate followed by some sliced steak. Top with a poached egg and finish with the pan sauce.'

S'Prepare the vinaigrette, just before use. Place the lemon in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since the lemon will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set it aside briefly, until it cools just enough to handle.Pour vinegar into a blender, turn it on, and then squeeze in lemon juice from the microwaved lemon. Leaving the blender running, add 1 at a time through the feed opening: garlic, mustard, chives, basil, and yogurt, and blend until smooth. While keeping the blender running, add oil through the feed opening in a slow stream.Mix together tomatoes, celery, and scallions and toss with dressing.'

S'For the salad, combine pomegranate, oranges, grapes, lime zest, lime juice, and mint leaves. Set aside briefly. In a small bowl, make a paste with the 1/2 cup of the lemon juice (reserving the rest - about 1/4 cup - for a lemon-butter sauce), lemon zest, and lemon pepper. Season the swordfish steaks with salt and press some of the lemon paste into the top surface of the fish to make a crust on each.  Over medium heat in a large saute pan, heat the olive oil and melt 1/4 cup butter. Starting with the crust side down first, sear the swordfish steaks. It is important to leave the fish undisturbed for about 3 minutes for the seasonings to integrate into the surface of the fish and for the caramelization process to begin. This will prevent the layer of seasonings from "crusting off". Flip the fish and sear the other side. Swordfish must be cooked briefly because it easily dries out. Remove fish to a utility platter and let rest. (The fish will continue to cook even when it is removed from the heat because of a process known as "carryover" cooking. It is especially important to be mindful of this with swordfish. Do not overcook the fish. If you cook this fish in the pan until it "looks" done - it will end up being overdone after carryover cooking.)To the pan, add the reserved lemon juice and swirl to get all the bits in the pan. Remove from heat and whisk in cubed butter. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed.Place swordfish steaks on serving plate and drizzle with a small amount of the lemon butter sauce. Spoon citrus salad around fish.'

S"Special equipment: 12 individual (3 1/2-inch diameter, 1/2-cup capacity) lightly buttered flan tins or custard cupsPreheat oven to 325 degrees F.Have a tray of ice water ready into which you will be able to immerse the bottoms of the custard cups. To a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan add sugar and evenly pour the red wine over the top. Without disturbing the contents, heat the saucepan over medium heat. Do not stir. Swirl the pot gently until the sugar dissolves, but do not let the syrup boil UNTIL you see that the sugar has dissolved, that is, when the syrup is clear and you don\\'t see any cloudiness or sugar crystals. You may have to remove the pot from the heat periodically to keep it from boiling before the sugar dissolves. When the sugar is entirely dissolved, cover the pot, increase the heat to high and boil for 2 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until you see that the syrup is beginning to darken. Avoid stirring as this will leave crystallized streaks in the syrup. When it is a deep amber remove the pot to the bowl of ice water you have standing by. Working quickly, immediately spoon a teaspoon of the caramel into each custard cup and swirl to coat the interior with a thin layer of caramel. Place each in the tray of ice water.Pour the coconut milk, evaporated milk, and milk into a saucepan and add the vanilla. Over medium low heat slowly bring to a boil, then remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar whipping until you see a change in color.  Slowly incorporate the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture a little at a time, whisking constantly as you go.Pour the custard into the caramel coated custard cups and place them in a roasting pan. Prepare a bain marie by adding hot water to the pan so that the water level is halfway up the side of the ramekins. Be careful to avoid splashing any water into the ramekins. Bake in the oven until a butter knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes, allow to cool and then refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. Just before serving remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm up a little. Then invert each custard from the mold onto a chilled dessert dish."

Stir the rice in the boiling water and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 12 minutes. Fluff with a fork and cover with a lid to hold warm for plating.For the stir-fried vegetables: Heat a wok until smoking. Remove the wok from the heat and add the grapeseed oil. Place the wok back over the heat, add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds, stirring to avoid burning the garlic. Add the carrots, mushrooms, onions and bok choy and stir-fry until the carrots are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl; cover to keep warm.For the sauce: Heat the wiped-clean wok over high heat. Add the chicken broth, sherry, fish sauce and ginger and bring to a boil. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 1/2 cup water and add it to the sauce slowly, whisking, until the sauce reaches the desired thickness (do not add it all if it thickens up enough first). Whisk the egg yolks into the sauce, then remove from the heat and season with salt, pepper and lime juice.For the fish: In a tall-sided pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F; line a plate with paper towels. In a shallow dish, season the cornstarch with the salt and pepper. Dredge the cod fillets in the cornstarch and immediately place them in the oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook the fish until it floats and cooks to a golden brown. Transfer the fish to the paper towels and sprinkle with additional salt and pepper.Scoop about 3/4 cup of rice onto the center of each of 6 plates. Top the rice with the stir-fried vegetables. Place the fried fish on top of the vegetables and spoon about 3 ounces of the sauce around the fish. Garnish the plate with the chopped scallions.'

Once removed from package, you will need to cover phyllo with waxed paper and a damp towel to prevent it from drying out. Lay out each dough sheet and brush on butter. Fold in half, brush again, fold in half, cut in half. (Each dough sheet should yield 2 rectangles, roughly 4 by 4 inches, so you will have 16 squares.) In mixing bowl, combine lobster, cheese, parsley and chives and season with salt and pepper. Place mixture on each square of dough.

S'Squeeze the lime juice (from the now cooled lime) through the feed opening of a running blender. With the blender still running, add the vinegar, corn syrup, shallot and rosemary, 1 at a time, and pour the oil in a slow steady stream into the vinegar mixture very slowly to emulsify. Remove to a container and season with salt and pepper, to taste.For the spring greens:Tear the greens into bite-sized pieces, and remove the stems if using arugula. (Make sure greens are no longer wet from being rinsed.) Toss greens with Parmesan, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and set aside.For the filling:Heat the clarified butter over medium heat in a large saute pan. Add the onion and cook for about 15 minutes until translucent and beginning to caramelize, then add the portobellos and white mushrooms to the onions. Cook for another 10 minutes then reduce heat to low and add the tomatoes, chives, salt, and pepper, and allow flavors to integrate.For the vol-au-vent (tart pastry):Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out puff pastry dough, and using a 4-inch circle cutter (aka biscuit cutter), cut out 8 dough rounds. Place 4 of the dough rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet. Using a 3-inch circle or biscuit cutter, cut a concentric circle in the middle of the remaining 4-inch dough rounds to create a 1/2-inch wide circle of dough. These 1/2-inch wide circles of dough are to be used without the 3-inch pieces from the center. Place 1 of these 1/2-inch wide circles of dough on top of each of the rounds already on the baking sheet, matching up the edges. Brush egg wash over the surface of each of the paired dough circles and rounds. Then use a fork to prick through the dough around the perimeter (that is, through each dough circle and into the accompanying round beneath it). Place in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. The center of each will rise. Remove pastry shells from oven and allow to cool slightly.Using the tip of a butter knife, break through the risen center part of each pastry shell to make a crater. Spoon some of the mushroom mixture into each of these craters. Place some greens on top of each tart and drizzle with lime balsamic vinaigrette.'

Slowly whisk in the truffle oil and olive oil, ensuring that all of the oil is being absorbed before more is added. Continue to add the oil until all of it has been added, then season with hot sauce, salt and white pepper, to taste. Stir in the parsley and the dry mustard and set aside.Remove the eggs from the water, peel and remove the yolks to a medium bowl. Add truffle mayonnaise and mix well with a fork.

S'Prepared a large ice bath. Fill a high-sided pot with a lid with 3 gallons water, then mix in 1 cup of the salt and bring to a rolling boil.Place the lobsters in the boiling water and cover the pot with the lid. Cook the lobsters for 8 minutes, and then remove them from the water and cool down the lobsters in the prepared ice bath.To remove the meat, pull the tail off of the body and break off the rear tail fins. Pull the tail meat out of the body-end of the tail using a fork. (The tail meat may not be totally opaque white like the claw meat will be. That is OK, it is properly cooked and in order for the tail to be tender it needs to be slightly less cooked than the claw meat). Cut the lobster tail into large chunks.Next, pull the bottom part of each claw directly down detaching it from the claw; if done correctly this will remove the cartilage from the claws. Then crack the claws and remove the meat. To remove the knuckle pieces, separate the sections and use a lobster pick to remove the pieces. Finally, remove the legs and line them up with the claws facing you. Cover with plastic wrap and use a rolling pin to push the leg meat out starting at the claws and rolling away from you. Repeat for the remaining lobsters.Heat a griddle or saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke and then turn the heat down to medium-high.Spread some butter on both sides of each hot dog bun. Toast the buns on the hot griddle until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Once toasted, remove from the heat and split the buns open, and then hold for plating.In a bowl, combine the lobster, mayonnaise, remaining teaspoon of salt, the pepper and lemon juice, and gently mix to coat the lobster but not break up the meat.To plate the lobster roll, place one piece of the hot dog bun on the plate with a lettuce leaf on top. Spoon 4 1/2 ounces of lobster salad on top of the lettuce leaf and then top with the other side of the hot dog roll. Repeat for the remaining rolls, and serve each with a lemon wedge.'

S'Special equipment: a deep-fry thermometerFor the French fries: In a deep pot or a tabletop fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 250 degrees F.Cut the potatoes into batons leaving the skin on (the pieces should be 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch by the full length of the potatoes). Rinse the potatoes under cold water.Fry the potatoes, in batches if necessary, until just tender but not mushy, about 4 minutes. There should be little to no color. Transfer the blanched fries onto a baking sheet and cool completely in the refrigerator.For the tartar sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, buttermilk, capers and relish in a bowl and whisk together.For the fried fish: Increase the heat under the pot of vegetable oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees F.In a bowl, combine the eggs, soda water and crushed ice. Add the flour and whisk the batter. Do not overmix. Place the panko in a second shallow bowl. Place some flour for dedging in a third shallow bowl.Season the fish with salt and pepper. Dredge each piece in the flour, then dip in the batter and then dredge in the panko.Deep fry the pieces of fish, in batches if necessary, until golden brown and crispy, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the fryer and allow to rest on a cooling rack for 5 to 10 minutes.While the fish rests, finish cooking the French fries. Bring the oil temperature back to 350 degrees F. Fry the French fries, in batches if necessary, until golden brown and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Toss the French fries in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.For plating: Mound some fries on each plate and place a piece of fish over the top. Serve the tartar sauce on side.'

S'For the pot roast: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Sprinkle the chuck roast with 3 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper.Heat the vegetable oil over high heat in a rondeau or large Dutch oven until it begins to shimmer. Sear the beef on all sides to a deep brown, about 3 minutes per side; remove to a plate.Add the onions to the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until caramelized, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the carrots and celery, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste; cook 1 to 2 minutes more.Deglaze the pan with the red wine and cook until reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes. Put the roast and any accumulated juices back in the pan. Add veal broth to cover by two-thirds. Bring to a simmer, then cover with a lid.Transfer to the oven and cook until the roast registers an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Baste every 20 minutes during cooking, and turn the beef over in the broth periodically.Remove the roast to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, skim the broth of fat and bring to a simmer on the stovetop. Melt the butter in a saute pan and stir in the flour to make a roux. Whisk the roux into the simmering broth; cook for 15 minutes.Slice the beef against the grain. Put the slices in the sauce, and hold.For the mashed potatoes: Place the potatoes in a tall pot; add cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.Strain the potatoes and allow them to sit for 2 to 3 minutes to dry out a bit. Wipe the pot dry. Run the potatoes through a ricer into the pot. Add the sour cream and butter, and mix well. Season with salt and white pepper.For the green beans and carrots: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Bring 1 gallon water to a boil and season with 2 ounces kosher salt. Set up an ice bath for shocking the green beans.Add one-third of the green beans to the boiling water; cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to the ice bath to stop cooking. Dry the beans well on paper towels. Repeat two more times, until all the green beans are blanched.In a bowl, toss the carrots with 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil, and season with salt and pepper. Spread the carrots on a baking sheet, transfer to the oven, and cook until tender and browned, about 15 minutes.In a large skillet heat the remaining 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil over medium heat. Add the blanched green beans and roasted carrots, and saute for 11 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.To plate: Divide the mashed potatoes between 6 large pasta bowls. Arrange the green beans on top of the potatoes, then arrange the beef slices on top of the beans. Ladle some of the sauce over the beef. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired. Serve immediately.'

S'Cut off duck wings at second joint, remove excess fat and skin, rinse and dry well. Insert a chopstick through the neck opening and force along the wing bone under the skin until it protrudes slightly at the second joint. Push other end along other wing so that you end up with a duck that has its arms straight out like a crucifix. Tie a string onto the middle of the stick so you can hold the duck and hang it up. Bring 6 cups of water to boil in a wok, over medium heat. Add maltose or honey and stir to dissolve. Stir in the sherry, vinegar and cornstarch slurry.When liquid returns to a boil, dip the duck into liquid and spoon liquid over duck. Repeat until duck is thoroughly moistened. Repeat dunking once more. Hang duck by the string in a cool airy place with a bowl underneath to catch drips. Leave for 4 to 6 hours until skin is dry and taught. Put roasting pan on lower oven rack and fill with 2 to 3 inches of water. Oil the upper rack above pan.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Remove the chopstick and string. Put duck on oiled rack in center of oven breast side up and cook for 30 minutes. Turn duck breast side down for 45 minutes, then turn breast side up for 30 minutes or until skin is dark brown. While duck is roasting, make scallion brushes. Trim roots, and cut off most of green part, leaving 3-inch pieces. Make several 1-inch lengthwise slits in each end of scallion, and put in a bowl of ice water for 20 minutes, drain and refrigerate. Mix hoisin with sesame oil and 1 tablespoon water, in a small serving bowl. Carve the duck, separate meat and skin. Place on a serving platter and surround with the scallion brushes. Serve the sauce with the duck.'

When thoroughly mixed, pour into a metal bowl and put over a bowl of ice water.Add the shrimp, sea bass and salmon to the scallop mixture and gently fold to combine. Cook\\'s Note: At this point you can do a test with the finished mixture by bringing a small saucepan of water to a boil over medium heat and adding a small amount of the mixture. Reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture floats to the top. Cool it in a bowl of ice water and taste. This will tell you if you\\'ve seasoned it correctly before you stuff the mixture into the casings.Stuff the seafood mixture into the pork casing, and tie into 4-inch links. In a medium saucepan, bring the fish stock or water to a simmer over low heat. Add the links and poach gently until cooked through.In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat the oil, then add the red onion and cook until translucent. Add the sauerkraut and mustard and cook for 4 minutes, then add the chopped tarragon.To serve, add a little sauerkraut to each plate and top with 2 seafood hot dogs."

S'Blending Hot Liquids: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid; that prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times, then process on high speed until smooth.'

S'Bring vegetable broth to a simmer. In a separate large saucepan on an adjacent burner, heat the oil and saute onion until it is translucent. Add barley (or rice) and lightly saute to toast the barley. Add wine and stir for about 2 minutes until it is absorbed. Begin slowly adding broth, 1 ladle-full at a time, to the barley pan, stirring as you go. The friction of the stirring will bring out the starch in the barley. As the mixture absorbs the broth, ladle more into the pot. When all of the broth has been ladled into the barley pot, slowly simmer until barley is soft and creamy. Stir in ricotta to add creaminess, then crumble in goat cheese (to add cohesiveness), stir, cover and set aside.For the pesto:Place basil in food processor, add pine nuts and garlic, and pulse until chopped. Scrape into a bowl, add Parmesan and stir in oil to form a thick smooth paste. Add black pepper, to taste.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread half of the barley (or rice) mixture over the bottom of a lasagna dish or large casserole. Top with half of the sun-dried tomatoes and then with half of the basil pesto. Repeat for a second layer. Bake covered with foil for 25 minutes, then remove foil and continue to bake for 5 minutes to let top layer of pesto become toasted. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Serve garnished with fresh basil sprigs.'

Using a slicer with a wide blade or a chef\\'s knife, slice the potatoes into chips.Place in a large bowl with cold water.In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and green tea mix. Sift all the ingredients together to aerate the flour. Whisk in the beer until the batter is completely smooth and free of any lumps. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Note: The batter can be made up to 1 hour ahead of time. Drain potatoes thoroughly, removing any excess water and pat dry with paper towels. When oil reaches 320 degrees, submerge the potatoes, in batches, into the oil. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes until they are pale and floppy. Remove from oil, drain, and cool to room temperature. Increase the temperature of the oil to 375 degrees F. Add the cooked fries and fry until crisp and golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and drain on roasting rack. Season with kosher salt while hot and hold in the oven. Allow oil to return to 350 degrees F. Lightly dredge fish in flour. Working in small batches, dip the fish into batter and immerse into hot oil. When the batter is set, turn the pieces of fish over and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain the fish on the roasting rack. Serve with malt vinegar and tartar sauce."

S'Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Rinse strip loin to remove residue and season with salt. Combine horseradish and black pepper in a small bowl to make a paste. Place loin in roasting pan and coat entirely with paste. Roast until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 140 to 142 degrees F as measured with an instant-read thermometer, about 30 to 40 minutes, then remove from oven and let rest to carryover cook to about 150 degrees for medium-rare, or cook for whatever length of time is needed (usually specified on your meat thermometer) for your desired level of doneness.For the sauce, heat grapeseed oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. When it begins to shimmer, add the beef trimmings and cook for about 10 minutes until you see that the fat is rendered from the meat. You should pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat or, if necessary, supplement with grapeseed oil if you do not have 2 tablespoons in the pan. Add garlic and onion and gently saute until the onion turns translucent. Pour beer into the pan and cook over medium heat until most of the alcohol has evaporated, then stir in the beef base (which has been diluted in water) and tomato paste. Return to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low and allow to reduce by half. Strain into a bowl and gradually whisk in cubed butter. Nest bowl in another bowl filled with hot water and cover to keep warm.For the vegetable medley, blanch carrots and haricots verts for 2 minutes in salted water and drain well. Heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in a large saute pan. When it begins to shimmer, add shallot, peppers, carrots and green beans and season with salt and pepper. Saute until the shallot turns translucent and the peppers begin to soften. Remove to a bowl and cover until needed. Reserve the saute pan.For the rissole, boil the potatoes until soft, and drain well.For the onion rings, heat oil in the reserved saute pan over medium-high heat. Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt in a small bowl and pour the beer in a stream while whisking constantly. Dip the onion slices into the batter and fry until golden. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Discard oil and reserve the saute pan.Return to the rissole. In the same pan saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil over medium high heat in a large skillet, reserving the other tablespoon. When it begins to shimmer, saute the white onion until tender. Transfer the onion to the potatoes which have been boiled for the rissole, reserving the saute pan. Season potatoes, to taste, with salt and pepper, and mash together. Fold in the scallions and crab trying to avoid breaking up the crab. Allow to sit until cool enough to handle, then use 3-inch circle cutters as molds and form the potato/crab mixture into circles. In the same pan, heat additional grapeseed oil for the rissole over medium-high heat and sear the potato cakes leaving undisturbed for the first 2 to 3 minutes on each side to let the caramelization process begin and to prevent the cake from breaking apart. When you see the edges of the cake beginning to turn golden brown, flip and sear the other side. Then cook further until the cake is firm. Remove from heat and keep warm.Slice roast sirloin. Place a rissole circle on serving plate. Place sliced beef on top and spoon demi-glace over. Top with onion rings. Arrange some vegetable medley around.'

S'For the creamy grits: Heat the heavy cream and chicken stock to a simmer in a saucepot. Rain in the grits and cook, whisking frequently, for 5 to 6 minutes. Fold in the butter, cream cheese and Parmesan and season with salt and white pepper. Top with the milk and reserve (the milk will prevent a skin from forming). Fold in the milk just before serving.For the Cajun sauce: In a nonreactive saucepot, reduce the wine over medium heat until almost dry. Add the chicken stock, cream, Worcestershire, shallots and lemon juice and reduce slightly. Add the paprika, seafood seasoning and thyme and simmer until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 6 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and whisk in the butter. Season with salt and black pepper.For the catfish: Heat a saute pan to medium heat. Dust the catfish with the Cajun spice on both sides. Add the grapeseed oil and catfish to the pan and cook until done, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate and top with the butter, making sure it melts completely. Reserve.For the crispy kale: Heat a saute pan to medium heat and add the grapeseed oil. Add the garlic and onions and sweat until the vegetables are translucent. Add the kale and saute until wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock. Remove from the heat and fold in the butter. Season with salt and black pepper.To serve: Spoon some Cajun sauce in the center of each plate. Spoon some creamy grits on top of the sauce. Add the kale, followed by the catfish.'

S'Note: The duck has to be prepared the day before because of the long slow cooking time.Mix the 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper and garlic together and coat the duck with the seasonings rubbing into the surface of the duck. On the stovetop heat the oil or lard in a deep roasting pan (if you will be using the oven) or in a large Dutch oven (if you will be cooking on the range). (Note: you will be poaching the duck, not frying it, so, it is important to avoid making the oil too hot.) Add the duck to the warm oil. If you are using the oven put the duck in a preheated 200 degree F oven for about 6 to 8 hours. If you are using the stovetop, cook the duck at a 180 degree F simmer for 6 to 8 hours. The duck must be cooked until it falls away from the bone. Remove all the duck meat from the bones and reserve meat until needed.Fill a large pot with water, add salt and boil pasta until al dente, cooked with a bite, about 10 to 12 minutes, drain and set aside. While the pasta is boiling, saute garlic, onion, and sun-dried tomatoes until the onion is translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes and cook together for about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, as needed.Shred the duck meat, combine with sauce and toss with pasta. Transfer to a serving dish and top with fresh chives and basil, sprinkle with Parmesan and drizzle with truffle oil, for garnish.'

S'For the braised pork shoulder: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Combine the salt, pepper, oregano and cumin, and mix well. Rub the pork all over with the spice mix.Heat a large cast-iron skillet or saute pan over high heat until smoking. Add the oil and sear the pork on all sides until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a deep baking dish.Deglaze the skillet with the chicken stock, then pour enough stock over the pork to cover by two-thirds. Cover tightly with parchment paper and then with foil. Place in the oven and cook until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.Remove from the oven and allow the pork to cool in its cooking liquid for about 30 minutes. When cool, slice the pork thin and against the grain.For the Cuban sandwich: Heat a flat top grill or panini press to medium-high.Cut the bread in half horizontally and spread 1/2 tablespoon of butter on each cut-side. Toast the bread, cut-side down. (If using a panini press, do not close the press.)Cut the swiss cheese slices in half; place two halves on bottom halves of the bread. Layer with 6 ounces of sliced pork shoulder, 4 ounces of sliced ham, 2 pickle slices and 2 half slices of swiss cheese. Spread 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard on the top piece of bread, and top the sandwich.Brush the top and bottom of each sandwich with butter and place on the flat top with a weight on top, or use a panini press. Cook until golden brown and the cheese is melted; on a flat top, turn the sandwich over and cook until the reverse side is crisp and golden.'

S"In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of oil and the onions. Saute until the onions are translucent. In the same skillet, add the sausage meat and cook until all the sausage has changed color and is cooked, about 5 minutes. Add the cornbread and fresh herbs and continue to cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to rest until cool.When cool add the whipped egg whites, heavy cream and melted butter and stir to combine. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.Make a cut 1/4-inch from the top of the loin down the full length and roll the pork cutting at the same time, this will give you a flat piece of meat ( if you were to roll it back up it would look like it did before you cut it).  Evenly spread the stuffing over the flattened pork loin and then re-roll it back to the original form.Tie together with butcher\\'s twine, so the loin is tied every 1 to 2 inches. Refrigerate for about 1 hour to rest and firm up a bit.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Using a large skillet over high heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil and sear the whole pork loin until golden brown all over, then transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 15 to 17 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F.Check the pork temperature after 10 minutes, as some ovens cook faster than others, and we don\\'t want the meat to overcook. The loin should be removed from the oven when it reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer the loin to a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil, to rest for 5 minutes. It will continue to cook and reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Slice the pork and arrange on a serving platter to serve."

S'Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves and nutmeg in a heavy-gauge, non-corrosive saucepan over medium heat. In a separate pan create a roux by cooking the butter and flour for a few minutes, stirring continuously, without browning, until it emits a nutty aroma. Remove from the heat. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the cooled down roux, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and season, to taste, with salt and white pepper. Whisk in mustard and cover with a piece of plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming.Heat the grill to medium heat.  Prepare the tortillas by laying 1 or 2 slices of cheese on top of each and set aside briefly. Slowly cook the bratwurst over medium heat, turning as needed to prevent them from getting charred. (They tend to split when the heat is too high.) When they are browned and cooked through, which takes 10 to 15 minutes, transfer them to the cheese lined tortillas, and roll up the bratwursts so that the cheese will melt and hold everything together. Place the rolled bratwursts in a skillet over medium heat, allowing the tortillas to toast slightly. Serve with mustard sauce.'

S"Blanch the haricots verts in salted boiling water until al dente (or cooked to your liking). Drain the beans into a strainer or colander and then they should be shocked by dunking the strainer of beans into a waiting bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process, and will help them retain a bright green color. Drain and set aside in refrigerator until needed.Place the lime in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. The lime will be hot coming from the microwave, so let it cool just enough so you can handle it, before squeezing it. Turn on the blender and through the feed opening, add the rosemary, tarragon, cilantro, stone ground mustard, rice wine vinegar, and fresh ginger, and blend together until a smooth paste has formed. At this point the lime should be cool enough to squeeze. With the power on, add the lime juice through the blender feed-tube, and then very slowly add the oil and water until the mixture thickens and can coat the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside in refrigerator until needed. (When chilled, the dressing should resemble something like mayonnaise.)  Reserve some of the dressing to drizzle on the plate later. Then, mix the beans, onion, and tomato with the dressing (adjusting the amount to your preference) and refrigerate for only a couple of hours. (Don\\'t mix too far ahead, because the salad ingredients will bleed and you will have a very runny dressing)."

S'For the chutney: Preheat the grill to medium heat. Brush the tomato halves with grapeseed oil and place on the grill. Grill for just 1 minute to get a char and soften the tomatoes. Chop the tomatoes and add to a bowl. Stir in the shallot, thyme, parsley, and garlic. Drizzle in just enough olive oil to moisten the mixture. Season with salt.For the burger: In a bowl, blend the onions and beef and season with salt. Do not over-mix, this will cause the burgers to be too tightly bound. Next, portion into 2 balls, create a pocket in the center of each ball, and fill each ball with half the cheese. Season the outside of the balls and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.For the vegetables: In a bowl, mix the oil, vinegar, herbs, and garlic and add the vegetables. Allow the vegetables to marinate for 10 minutes. Grill over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes each side. Increase the heat to medium-high.After resting the burgers, pat each burger flat into a 1 by 6-inch patty. Grill over medium-high heat about 6 minutes on each side.

S'For the stuffing: In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the grapeseed oil and allow to warm. Then add the onions and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Next add the lamb, reduce the heat to medium and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Cook until the meat is browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Once cooked, add the tomato paste and garlic and finish cooking for 2 minutes, allowing all the flavors to blend. Remove from the pan and allow to cool for stuffing.For the peppers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Preheat a deep-fryer to 400 degrees F. To stuff the peppers, split each pepper lengthwise, stem to tip, and remove all seeds. After removing the seeds, add the cooked lamb to the pepper cavity, about 1 tablespoon per pepper. Repeat the process, stuffing each pepper. To finish, lay the bacon flat on the counter or cutting board and "spread" the bacon with the flat side of a knife, pulling the flat side of the knife along the slice of bacon to thin it and double the length of the slice. Once the bacon has been thinned, slice the bacon in half lengthwise and wrap the peppers with bacon. Secure the ends with skewers.After wrapping peppers, bake until the bacon has tightened slightly, 10 to 12 minutes. After cooking, remove from the oven and deep fry for 2 to 3 minutes, crisping the bacon on the exterior. Remove from the fryer and allow excess oil to drain. Serve with Spiced Aioli.'

Remove from the heat and let cool, then squeeze the water out of the collards until almost dry. Place collards on a cutting board and coarsely chop.Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine the dry bread crumbs with the Parmesan, minced parsley, sage, garlic and extra-virgin olive oil. Pulse until just blended. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter a shallow 4-quart casserole. In a large bowl, mix the collards with the cream and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the eggs until blended and spread the collards into the prepared casserole. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the Parmesan crumbs over the collards. Return to the oven and bake for about 20 minutes longer, or until the crumb topping is golden. Preheat the broiler and broil the collards 10 inches from the heat until the bread crumb topping is golden brown and crisp. Serve hot. Tastes great with fried chicken.'

S'For the chimichurri: In a food processor, combine the parsley, cilantro, oregano, garlic, shallot, cumin, pepper flakes, salt, red wine vinegar and honey. With the food processor running, slowly add the olive oil; the final product should be smooth but still have a bit of texture to it.For the rice and black beans: Heat the grapeseed oil in a pot over high heat. Add the rice and coriander and cook, stirring, to toast the rice, about 2 minutes. Add the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until the liquid is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes.Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and fluff with a fork. Mix in the black beans, cilantro, lime juice, salt and pepper.For the smoked tomato salsa: Prepare a smoker with soaked wood chips (cherry or apple wood preferred) and heat to 350 degrees F.Place the tomato halves, onion quarters, garlic and jalapeno in a pan. Transfer to the smoker and cook until the onions are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.Dice half of the onions and half of the tomatoes. In a food processor, puree the remaining onions and tomatoes along with the jalapeno, garlic and the lime juice.In a bowl, mix the pureed sauce with the diced onions and tomatoes and the chopped cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper.For the lemon aioli: In a food processor (or using an immersion blender) combine the lemon juice, mustard, egg, egg yolk and garlic; puree until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil to emulsify the aioli. Season to taste with salt and pepper.For the flank steak: Cut the flank steak into six equal portions, slicing against the grain and on an extreme bias. With the back of a knife, tenderize the steaks by pounding them out on both sides. Season on both sides with salt and pepper.Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until smoking. Add just enough grapeseed oil to coat the pan. Working in batches, sear the steaks on both sides, about 2 minutes. Remove the steaks to a plate to rest before plating.To plate: Divide the rice and beans between six plates, mounding it in the center of each plate. Spoon about 2 ounces of the salsa over the top and then lay a steak over the rice. Drizzle some chimichurri over the steak.In a bowl, dress the watercress with lemon aioli. Top the steaks with the dressed watercress. Serve.'

S'Place flour in a mound on a wood surface and make a small well in the middle of the flour. Lightly beat eggs with salt and vinegar. Gradually add egg mixture a little at a time to the flour, combing with a fork to moisten all bits of flour. Knead dough into a cohesive mass. Then continue kneading until smooth and elastic, about 400 strokes. Separate about 1/4 of the dough into a separate ball for frying. Cover each portion of dough with plastic wrap to prevent drying out and let rest for about 20 minutes at room temperature.Season chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. Heat butter and oil in a large rondeau or saute pan, and brown chicken on all sides. Remove chicken to a utility platter, and add mushrooms to pan and saute until golden brown. Then add shallot and garlic and cook until translucent. Add cherry brandy, then de-glaze pan with wine. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Return the chicken parts to the sauce, add the sachet, cover and cook over low heat until chicken is tender, about 40 minutes.While chicken is cooking, roll out dough in pasta machine (1/4 at a time) until it is about 1/16th of an inch thick. Cut the reserved portion for frying into thin strips, 2-inches long. Cut the larger portion into ribbons with a pasta roller or pizza cutter. Fry the smaller reserved portion at 350 degrees F until golden brown and place on paper toweling to drain. Cook larger portion in boiling water until al dente, just a few minutes for fresh pasta, and drain. Gently remove chicken to a platter, strain sauce and return the sauce to the pan. Allow sauce to reduce until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Finish sauce by removing from heat and whisking in creme fraiche. Season with salt and pepper, as needed.Place boiled pasta on serving plate and top with chicken. Spoon sauce around chicken and top with fried dough.'

S'Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Place tomatoes cut-side down on a baking sheet lined with foil for easy cleanup and brush skin with 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil, reserving the rest of the oil. Roast tomatoes until charred, about 15 minutes, remove from oven and place in plastic bags to sweat. This will help make it easier to remove the skin.Heat chicken stock in a medium saucepot over medium heat. Peel shrimp and add shells to the pot, reserving the shrimp. Bring the pot of stock and shells to a boil, skimming any impurities which rise to the surface.In a large stockpot, heat the remaining grapeseed oil over medium heat and melt the butter in it, and saute onions and garlic until onions turn translucent. Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to soften and give up their juices. Strain the chicken stock into the stockpot with the onions and mushrooms and discard the shrimp shells. Remove skin from the roasted tomatoes and add them to the pot. Add the white rice and all-purpose seasoning, bring to a gentle boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer 20 minutes.Chop most of the shrimp, small dice, reserving about 8 whole shrimp. Stir chopped shrimp into pot and add whole shrimp last, without stirring in the whole shrimp. Cover pot and let cook for 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and scoop out whole shrimp and transfer to a utility plate and cover to keep warm. Stir heavy cream into pot and puree with an immersion blender and season with salt and pepper. Spoon into soup bowls and garnish with whole shrimp topped with cilantro and mint. Serve with croutons.'

S'In a large skillet over medium heat, add the sugar, water and raspberries.  Cook until the sugar and the raspberries are wet and paste-like, about 8 minutes.  Strain the mixture into a small bowl to remove the seeds. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon a little of the mixture, to form disks the size of a penny, onto the baking sheet.  Freeze until hardened, about 2 hours.To make the frozen bomb, using a 3 to 4-ounce ice cream scoop, put 8 full-sized scoops of ice cream onto a chilled platter.  Next, remove the fruit disks from the freezer and from the bottom of the ice cream insert the fruit disk into the center of the ice cream.  Continue this method until all are done.  Return them to the freezer to set up nicely, this should take about 1 hour.In a small saucepan, bring the cream and the butter to a boil over medium heat. Break up the chocolate into small pieces, add them to a stainless steel bowl and pour in the heated cream and butter mixture.  Allow to stand for 5 minutes, then whisk until all the ingredients are well incorporated. Keep warm. Remove the ice cream from the freezer. Stick a fork into the bottom of the ice cream and dip it into the melted chocolate to cover completely. Put the chocolate bomb on a wire cooling rack with a baking sheet underneath (to catch any dripping chocolate). Repeat with remaining ice cream and chocolate. Sprinkle with colored sugar or jimmies and return to the freezer.To finish, cut the brownie squares in half, horizontally, making 8 squares. Using a cookie cutter, cut out circles a little bigger that the ice cream bomb.  Arrange the circles on serving plates and top each with an ice cream bomb. Garnish with whipped cream, if desired.'

Place in refrigerator to let cool and jell up. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. If phyllo was frozen, make sure it is completely defrosted before handling it. Once removed from package, you will need to cover phyllo with waxed paper and a damp towel to prevent it from drying out. Working with 1 sheet at a time, lay out each dough sheet and brush on butter. Fold in half, brush again, fold in half, cut in half. (Each dough sheet should yield 2 rectangles, roughly 4 by 4 inches, so you will have 16 squares.) Spoon a small amount of mascarpone cheese and a spoonful of the cranberry mix in the center of each square. Bring up corners to form into a small square packet and brush more butter on top.

S'Mix together the butter and fresh herbs. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Place mixture on plastic wrap or wax paper and roll into a log shape of approximately 1-inch diameter and place in freezer.  For the best results, do this the night before.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil to 300 degrees F or until a bread crumb sizzles when dropped in. DO NOT ALLOW OIL TO SMOKE!Take chicken breasts and using a sharp knife, make a pocket on the top of the breast at least 1-inch long and about 1-inch deep. Remove butter from freezer and slice into disks about 1-inch long. Stuff the butter into the pocket made on the chicken breast, making sure the flap can close to hide the butter.In preparation for breading, prepare the following: Season the flour with salt and pepper and place in a shallow dish. Mix the eggs and milk and place in another shallow dish. Place the bread crumbs in a third shallow dish.Cover 1 chicken breast in flour, removing any excess. Then into the egg mixture, covering completely and removing any excess liquid. Then cover with breadcrumbs and place in hot oil. Cook until golden brown on outside and remove from oil. Repeat process with remaining chicken breasts. Drain and place on baking tray and put into the oven for another 10 to 12 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.

S'To cook the geoduck, remove the siphon (the neck part) from the shell. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil, add the geoduck and cook for about 20 seconds. Immediately immerse in iced water. Drain and remove the outer skin and discard. Cut in half lengthwise and thinly slice on a bias (the thinner the better as it will marinate and pick up more flavor). In a stainless steel bowl mix together the prepared geoduck, onions, and mushrooms. Cover and set aside in refrigerator for about 20 minutes. In a small bowl add the oil, rice wine vinegar and mustard and combine well. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.  At this point carefully add hot sauce to your liking. (Remember the more you add the hotter it gets.) To finish, add a little dressing to the geoduck salad and let marinate for a further 20 minutes in the refrigerator.Toss the chopped romaine lettuce, chives, cilantro and mango in a serving bowl and top with the geoduck salad.'

S'To make the tomato demi-glace, heat grapeseed oil in a medium saucepot over medium-high heat. Add garlic and scallions and saute lightly for 1 minute. Stir in sun-dried tomatoes, vinegar, beef base and liquid. Let reduce by half.Blanch Brussels sprouts until just tender and drain well. Fry bacon until crisp in a large skillet with oven safe handles and drain on paper towels. Pour most of the bacon fat from the pan and melt butter over medium heat in the same pan. Sprinkle paprika over the cut side of blanched Brussels sprouts and saute cut side down in butter, leaving undisturbed for a few minutes to let the caramelization process begin. Transfer to a bowl, crumble bacon over, toss lightly and keep warm. Reserve pan for the steak.Strain tomato demi-glace through a chinois into a small bowl. Cover and keep warm by nesting bowl into another bowl of hot waterPreheat oven to 425 degrees F.Mash garlic and cracked pepper together with a mortar and pestle and set aside briefly. Season filet mignon with salt and pepper. Heat grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in the same oven-safe saute pan. Sear steak leaving undisturbed for the first 2 minutes or so to let the caramelization process begin. Flip steaks and cook the other side in the same way. Cook to an internal temperature of 115 degrees F as measured with an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare, or done to your liking. Remove from heat and press garlic/pepper paste onto surface of steaks. Finish in oven until the crust becomes golden brown, about 2 to 5 minutes. (Remember to use an oven mitt to remove pan from oven.)Reheat demi-glace over low heat, remove from burner and whisk in cubed butter to make sauce silky.Arrange Brussels sprouts and filet mignon on plate. Spoon tomato demi-glace over steak and serve.'

S'For the stuffing: In a pan over high heat, add the oil and allow to warm. Then reduce the heat and add the andouille and garlic, warming for 2 minutes, stirring throughout. Once warmed, add the stock, herbs, ginger powder and salt and pepper to taste, and again warm for 2 minutes. Once heated, remove and add to the cornbread and fold all the ingredients together. Allow to sit or rest for 20 minutes before stuffing the quail. This will allow all ingredients to bloom together, creating the stuffing.For the red eye gravy: In a small saucepan, warm the butter until melted, and then add the onions and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Once the onions are cooked, add the tasso and allow the onions and tasso to blend for 2 minutes. Next, add the coffee and allow the liquid to reduce by half in volume. Once the coffee has reduced, add the stock and parsley, reduce the heat to medium-low and allow to simmer for 10 to 12 minutes. Once finished, hold warm until serving.For the quail: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To stuff and cook the quail, portion the stuffing into 4 portions and then fill each quail cavity. Once stuffed, rub the exterior of the birds with the butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then bake for 16 to 18 minutes (or fry in in preheated 375 degree oil for 4 minutes), ensuring the stuffing is warmed above 165 degrees. Once cooked, remove from the oven and rest the quail while plating the remainder of ingredients.To plate, portion quarter of the potatoes to the center of a plate, then add Brussels to the side of the potatoes, then top the potatoes with a quail and finish with the prepared sauce.'

S"For the buffalo: Season buffalo meat with salt and pepper. In a large stockpot, cover buffalo meat with water, add onion, garlic, chiles and cumin. Cover and bring to a simmer. Slowly braise for about 2 hours or until the meat is fork tender. Reserve cooking liquid for the sauce.For the corn husks: Place the corn husks in a large bowl and cover with tepid water. You may have to weigh them down with another bowl of water. Allow to soak as needed to hydrate, while the buffalo is braising. For the masa de maez: Melt 2/3 cup of the shortening in a saucepan and set aside. With an electric mixer, beat the other 1 1/3 cups of the shortening until fluffy and gradually and alternately begin adding the harina and beef stock, mixing well after each addition. Then gradually add the melted shortening mixing completely after each addition. Cover the bowl of dough with a damp kitchen towel and set aside.Transfer the buffalo meat to a utility platter and shred with 2 forks. Reserve 2 cups of the cooking liquid for the sauce. (If there is not enough, don\\'t worry, you will supplement it with beef stock for the sauce.) Leave enough of the cooking juices to keep the meat just moist and return the shredded beef to this liquid, and cover to keep warm.Lay out the corn husks and spread about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of the masa dough into each followed by 1 to 2 tablespoons of the shredded buffalo. Fold each tamale so that the masa encases the meat, and use a thin strip of corn husk to tie the tamale. Place in a steamer basket, on end if possible, so that each tamale supports the one next to it. Place over a pot filled with a couple of inches of simmering water for steaming, cover and let steam until firm, about 1 hour. (The corn husk will fall away easily when it is done.While the tamales are steaming, make the tamale sauce. Heat the grapeseed oil over medium to medium high heat in a medium saucepot. When the oil begins to shimmer add the shallots and garlic and saute until the onion becomes translucent. Add 2 cups of the buffalo cooking liquid and/or beef stock to the shallots and garlic and increase heat to bring to a rapid boil. Add the chili powder, salt and pepper, to taste, and let reduce by half. Add the cornstarch to a separate small bowl and gradually whisk in 1 tablespoon of the liquid to create a slurry. Gradually whisk this into the saucepot to thicken the mixture.Let tamales rest briefly before serving, and serve with small bowls of tamale sauce."

S'For the tomato chutney: Add the oil to a saucepot over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and shallots and sweat, 3 to 4 minutes. Next, add the tomatoes and cook, stirring as you cook, 8 to 10 minutes. Finally, add the wine and allow the mixture to cook until the tomatoes have cooked down and the wine is completely cooked off, stirring occasionally, 10 to 12 minutes. Once the tomato mixture has cooked down and reduced by 20 to 30 percent, remove from the heat and sprinkle with the salt and pepper.For the blue cheese sauce: Add the butter to a saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted, reduce the heat and add the flour, stirring to create a roux. The roux should be pale blond in color. Once the roux is made, reduce the heat to low, add the milk, stirring into the roux and cooking until the milk has thickened. Finally, add the cheese and celery seeds to the saucepan, a small amount at a time. Repeat until all the cheese has been added and well blended. Remove the saucepan from the heat and continue to stir to ensure consistency.For the beef and asparagus: Warm the oil in a thick-bottomed saute pan, about 1 minute. During heating, sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper on both sides, and then add to the hot pan. Sear the beef for 2 minutes, flip and reduce the heat to medium-high. Cook the second side of the beef until brown, about 2 minutes. Then remove the beef to allow resting before serving. With the original pan still over heat, add the asparagus and cook, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping during the process.Serve the beef with the tomato chutney and blue cheese sauce, with asparagus on the side.'

S'For the fries: Rinse and cut the potatoes lengthwise into 1/4-inch-by-1/4-inch-length fingers and hold in cold water in the refrigerator for 3 hours and up to 1 day. During the soak for the potatoes, change the water out at least once. This will help remove some of the starch from the potatoes and result in a better fry.After soaking the potatoes, remove from the water and pat dry. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fryer to 300 degrees F. Pre-cook the potatoes for 3 minutes, blanching them. After blanching, return them to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. The cooling helps to create crispier skin during the second cooking. To finish, raise the fryer temperature to 350 degrees F. Remove the fries from the refrigerator. Load the fries into the baskets no more than one-third the depth of the baskets, and cook until crisp, a final 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and allow the oil to drip off. Season with salt and pepper.For the burgers: In a bowl, blend the sirloin with the salt and pepper, mixing well but do not over mix. Over mixing will result in tough burgers. Portion the meat into 6 equal balls. Next, between two 5-to-6-inch plates, with parchment paper on each plate, press the balls into 1-inch-thick patties.To cook, heat a large pan over medium heat with the grapeseed oil until hot, about1 minute. After heating the oil, add the burgers, reduce the heat to medium and cook on the first side, 4 to 5 minutes. Then flip the burgers and cook, another 4 to 5 minutes. After cooking the second side, add the cheese and turn the heat off. The burgers will finish with "carry over" cooking, and this will allow the cheese to melt.During the carry over cooking, heat a second pan over medium heat with the butter to coat the bottom of the pan, about 1 minute. Once the butter is heated, add the buns in batches and brown. This will take 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the buns once browned and repeat the process with the remaining buns.To build a burger, place a romaine leaf, tomato slice and cheesed burger on the bottom bun. Finish with the onion ring and bun top. Repeat for remaining burgers. Serve with the fries.'

Add about 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet. When the butter has melted, working in batches, open the buns and toast them in the skillet until they are golden brown.Wipe out the skillet and reheat it over medium-high heat. Season the burger patties with salt and pepper. Working in batches and using more of the oil and butter, place some of the burger patties in the skillet (do not crowd the pan). Cook until the burgers are well seared (about 3 minutes) and flip. Place a slice of cheese on each burger and continue to cook the burgers for 2 minutes longer. Cover the skillet to melt the cheese and steam the burgers. Continue until all the burgers are cooked, adding more oil and butter to the skillet between batches as necessary.Spread each side of the buns with about 2 teaspoons of Paul\\'s burger sauce. Season the tomato slices with salt and pepper and place the tomatoes on the bottoms of the buns. Place the cooked burger patties on top of the tomatoes and then top the burgers with shredded lettuce.

At this point the limes should be cool enough to squeeze. With the power still on, squeeze the lime juice through the blender feed-tube, and then very slowly add the buttermilk until the mixture thickens and can coat the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside in refrigerator until needed. (When chilled, the dressing should resemble something like mayonnaise.) Toss together lettuce, spinach, onion, celery, chives, and cucumbers. Fold in peas, corn, pineapple, cranberries, grape tomatoes, and tomato wedges. Serve family style with dressing on the side."

S"To begin the lobster filling: Melt the butter in a saute pan which is just large enough to accommodate the lobster tails. The butter should be very hot, but not sizzling (between 165 and 180 degrees F). Add the tails to the pan, meat side down - shell side up, and poach until the lobster is opaque. Remove to a utility platter and let cool. (Pour the melted butter into a bowl for use in other elements in this recipe.) Return 2 tablespoons of the reserved melted butter to the same saute pan and saute shallots and shiitake mushrooms until tender. Add crabmeat and scallions and heat for a few minutes, trying to avoid breaking up lumps. Set aside. Return to the lobster tails, loosen them from the shell. Reserve the shells for use in the sauce. Slice the tail meat lengthwise down the middle and into 4 slices crosswise.For the wrappers: Steam the cabbage leaves until tender but not mushy. Remember, the leaves will still have to be firm enough support the lobster filling. To begin the sauce: Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves, nutmeg, and lobster shells in a heavy-gauge, non-corrosive saucepan over medium heat. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the reserved melted butter (from poaching the lobster) into a separate heat resistant bowl and create a slurry with the cornstarch, then whisk in 1/4 cup Parmesan. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the slurry, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, add cognac, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf, cloves and lobster shells. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming.Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Gently fold the lobster and crabmeat together with just enough of the sauce to bind it. (Reserve the rest of the sauce for service.) If the filling seems loose, add more Parmesan to bind it. (You don\\'t want the filling to be too runny.) Lay the cabbage leaves out and remove stiff ribs/spines of leaves being sure to leave enough of the leaf in a shape that can be filled and rolled shut. Into each leaf, spoon 3 or 4 tablespoons of the lobster/crabmeat mixture, add a few chunks of avocado, fold in sides of leaf, and roll up. Place in an oven-proof dish layered on the bottom with a little of the sauce, sprinkle with a little Parmesan. Bake for 10 minutes to melt cheese. Serve garnished with fresh dill and with remaining lobster sauce on the side."

S'Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Pour the oil into a metal roasting pan and put it in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes to heat up the pan and condition it with the oil. Spread the bones out on the roasting pan and cook until browned, 30 to 45 minutes, turning the bones occasionally so they brown evenly.Transfer the bones to a large-enough stockpot to accommodate the bones, 6 quarts ice water and more. Use tongs to transfer the bones so you do not pour any fat into the stockpot. Add the ice water to the stockpot and bring to a simmer. Allow the stock to cook for 4 hours at a slow simmer. Skim the surface of the stock occasionally to remove any fat or impurities.While the stock is simmering, discard all but about 1/4 cup of the fat from the roasting pan. Bring the pan back up to temperature over high heat on the stovetop. Add the onions and carrots and cook until golden brown and caramelized. Add the celery and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme and bay leaf and cook, stirring regularly, until the tomato paste gets a brick red color, about 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the red wine and stir it into the mirepoix (vegetable) mixture.Add the mirepoix mixture to the stock after the 4-hour simmering time. Bring the stock back up to a simmer and continue to cook it for another 2 hours.In a separate pot, bring the remaining 7 cups red wine to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes.When the stock has simmered for 6 hours, strain it through a chinois and combine the strained stock with the reduced red wine. Bring the stock to a boil, lower the heat to a hard simmer and reduce the stock until it has a consistency that coats the back of spoon and is about 2 quarts (8 cups) in volume, up to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper and then strain the sauce though a chinois again. Yield: About 8 cups'

In a separate bowl, add the mayonnaise, parsley, mustard, seafood seasoning, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and egg and whisk to combine.Pour the crab cake base over the crab meat and mix gently by hand, trying to keep the pieces of crab together. Allow the crab cake mix to rest for 45 minutes in the refrigerator. Divide the crab cake mix into 12 portions and form into cakes.Heat a skillet over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and sear half of the crab cakes until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Let the first batch rest while you cook the second batch with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil.For the tartar sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, buttermilk, relish and capers in a bowl and whisk. Season with salt and pepper.For the tomato relish: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. Add the garlic and saute until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and tarragon and cook until warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vinegar and sugar and bring to a boil. Cook until the liquid is reduced to a syrup, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.For plating: Smear about 2 tablespoons of the tartar sauce on a plate. Shingle 2 crab cakes on top of the tartar sauce and then top the crab cakes with 2 tablespoons of the tomato relish. Repeat with the remaining crab cakes, tartar sauce and tomato relish.'

Remove the sauce from the mixer to a bowl and let rest for 1 hour before usage if possible. Tempura:In mixing bowl, mix all the dry ingredients together, blending well. Next, whisk in the egg, soda water, and vinegar. Keep the tempura cold until using, then stir again.Pork:In a mixing bowl, add the buttermilk and Cajun spice and whisk well. Add the pork and marinate for 20 to 30 minutes. In a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot, heat enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 350 degrees F and the oven to 300 degrees F.Remove the pork form the marinade and add it to the tempura batter. Remove the pork from the batter, 1 slice at a time, and carefully add to the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Cooking the pork should be done in 2 to 3 batches. Arrange the pork on a sheet pan and keep it warm in the preheated 300 degree F oven. After all the pork has been cooked, portion the pork onto serving plates and serve with the sauce.'

S'Make the butternut squash tacos: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss the squash with the oil, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Transfer the squash to a rimmed baking sheet and roast until a little golden and cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the squash from the oven and cool to room temperature. Transfer it to a medium bowl and combine with the beans and cilantro.While the squash roasts, make the beef tacos: To a large skillet, add the oil and heat over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is cooked out, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, coriander, cayenne and cornstarch and cook, stirring often, until the mixture is creamy looking, 3 to 4 minutes. Crumble in the beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 12 to 14 minutes.Stir in the tomato paste, and cook until the paste turns dark and dries in the pan, about 5 minutes. Add the broth and cook until the mixture is thick and creamy, 3 to 4 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.Serve the ground beef or squash fillings in taco shells topped with tomatoes, Cheddar cheese and sour cream.'

S"Microwave lime for about 30 seconds to release essential oils, and set aside just long enough so that it is cool enough to handle. Turn on the blender and while it\\'s running, add 1 at a time through the feed tube, the parsley, chives, and garlic, and blend together until a smooth paste has formed. At this point the lime should be cool enough to squeeze. With the power still on, squeeze the lime juice through the blender feed tube, and then very slowly add the buttermilk until the mixture thickens and can coat the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside in refrigerator until needed. (When chilled, the dressing should resemble something like mayonnaise.)Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large skillet with oven safe handles, cook bacon over low heat until crisp. Remove bacon and set aside to drain. Season turkey breast and add to the bacon fat rendered in the skillet and brown on all sides. Cover and roast until it reaches an internal temperature of 160 to 165 degrees F so that during the carryover cooking (it continues to cook after removed from oven) it reaches 170 degrees F. (This is done in an effort to keep the meat from drying out.) Remove turkey to a utility platter and let rest. Leave oven on to make croutons.Slice the epee loaf in half lengthwise and place on a baking sheet. Pour olive oil over cut side of bread, and season with dried parsley, salt and pepper. Toast in oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Remove from oven and let cool.Place lettuce on serving dish. Arrange tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and mozzarella cheese wedges on top. Break or cut cooked bacon into pieces and sprinkle on top. Cut bread into small croutons and distribute evenly on salad. Slice the turkey and erve with dressing on the side."

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Mix together the chili powder, brown sugar, dark chocolate, and coffee in a shallow dish. Coat the pork tenderloin with the mustard, then roll it into the chili powder mixture, coating well. Pat down to make sure the spices stick to the pork.Add the oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Quickly sear the pork all over to get a golden brown color, turning constantly so the meat doesn\\'t burn.Put the pork loin on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until required doneness is reached, about or 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the loin from the baking sheet to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.If needed, add a little more oil to the same skillet that was used to sear the pork. Heat the oil over low heat and stir in the onion. Saute the onion until soft, then add the chicken stock, root beer and apple juice. Simmer until the mixture is reduced to 1/2 the volume. Add the sour cream and stir until well combined.Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. The sauce should be thick and glossy. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. If the sauce is a little spicy, more sugar can be added.Slice the pork into medallions and transfer to a serving platter. Serve with the root beer sauce on the side. Enjoy."

S'eFor the mushrooms: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the oil to a light simmer and reduce to medium heat. Then add the mushrooms and cook until the exterior of the mushrooms softens, about 4 minutes. Remove and hold on a plate until serving.For the steak: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Warm the prepared potatoes and hold warm. Heat a thick-bottomed pan until the verge of smoking over medium-high heat. Then sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper on both sides. Apply the steak to the heated pan. Sear on the first side for 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, and then flip and repeat the process on the second side. This will result in a medium-rare steak. Finish the oven for higher temperatures.Once the steak is cooked, remove from the pan to rest, and then add the peppercorns to the pan and warm for 20 seconds. Then add the demi-glace and garlic, warming for 3 minutes. Once warmed, remove from the heat and stir in the butter until smooth.To serve, place a quarter of the mashed potatoes in the center of a plate, then place the cooked steak and drizzle with 1/4 cup sauce. Finish with a quarter of the mushrooms and 5 pieces of poached asparagus and serve.'

S'Heat 2 quarts water to boiling for the noodles.To make the teriyaki sauce, heat the rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, and scallions to a boil over medium heat. Let cook for 7 minutes, then whisk in cornstarch slurry and cook for another 3 minutes or so, to allow to thicken. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.Boil the noodles until tender, drain well, toss with about 1/4 cup of the oil to keep noodles from sticking and set aside.Heat the oil to deep-fry the noodles in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F, or as directed for similar foods.For the vegetables, heat 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil in a wok over medium high heat, reserving the rest of the oil. Saute celery and carrots until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes and add mushrooms and cook until they are soft and begin to give up their juices. Remove the vegetables to a utility plate, and add the other 2 tablespoons oil to the wok over medium heat. Add the cabbage to the wok and cook until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  While the cabbage is cooking, deep-fry the noodles and drain on paper toweling. Return the celery/carrot/mushroom mixture to the cabbage, add the water chestnuts, and stir to combine. Add the teriyaki sauce and cook for 5 minutes to heat through and integrate flavors. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and serve with fried noodles, topped with bean sprouts.'

S"Heat the nori enough to make it supple, at about 325 degrees F for 3 minutes. Place a sheet of nori on the bamboo mat with the wider part along the rolling edge of the mat. Spread 1/2 cup of the rice over the surface of the nori, leaving about 1/2-inch of nori on the furthest edge uncovered so you will be able to seal the roll. Press the rice down firmly but gently. Place a dab of wasabi - about 1/4 teaspoon - on your finger and spread a thin ribbon of wasabi from left to right along the centerline of the rice. On top of the line of wasabi, lay a length each of fish, cucumber, and scallion. Begin rolling the edge of the bamboo closest to you, using the mat to press down on the sushi roll firmly but gently as you roll. The nori should stick to itself when the roll is complete; if it doesn\\'t, use the cornstarch slurry to moisten it. Dip a knife in vinegared water and cut the roll into 6 even slices. Repeat for each maki. Arrange the rolls cut side up on a plate and top each roll with 1/4 teaspoon tobiko.Note: This recipe can be used in conjunction with the other recipes for the elements of the Bento Box of sushi hors d\\'uvre made on the episode which also included: Traditional Osaka Style Sushi, Rice Balls, and Nigiri Sushi.

S'Whisk the eggs in a bowl, then run them through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any stray shells.Combine the 12 cups chicken broth and the lemon juice in a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and hold at a simmer.Temper the eggs by gradually whisking broth into the eggs, one ladleful at a time. When you have added about a quarter of the broth, stir the mixture back into the pot. Cook at a low simmer, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. (Be careful not to let the soup boil or the eggs will overcook and ruin it.) Stir in the salt and white pepper and strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps.In a small saucepan, combine the shredded chicken and the 1/2 cup chicken broth. Bring to a simmer to warm the chicken, then strain off the broth. Divide the chicken and orzo among six bowls; add 1 teaspoon of the chopped dill to each bowl. Ladle the soup into the bowls and serve immediately.'

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

Cut the meat into 1-inch cubes, then place the meat in a bowl and pour in 1/2 cup of the red wine (reserving the other 1/2 cup), and let marinate for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight, if possible refrigerated.Whisk together the remaining red wine, the Worcestershire sauce, and the olive oil to make a sauce.Place red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers and onions on skewer in this order: red pepper, beef, onion, beef, green pepper, beef, etc. (With 3 pounds meat you will probably have around 48 cubes of beef, so you can put 3 or 4 beef cubes per skewer.)  Grill on all sides, brushing with sauce as it cooks. Let vegetables caramelize and lightly blacken beef, being careful not to burn.'

S'Lay the shortbread cookies out on a utility platter.Heat the caramel topping in a small saucepan so that it is viscous and spoon some on each cookie.Place the brandy and bananas in a saute pan and light the brandy to flambe the bananas. When the brandy has burnt off, place a banana piece on top of the caramel on each cookie.The chocolate to coat the bananas will be tempered, a term used to describe the successive melting and cooling of the chocolate within a certain temperature range. This process allows the molecules of the chocolate to align so that it will retain a silky appearance without a chalky finish. To temper the chocolate, place half of the semisweet chocolate pieces in each of 2  stainless steel bowls which will fit over a saucepan double-boiler fashion. Bring an inch or so of water to a boil in the saucepan and fit 1 of the bowls of chocolate pieces over it and heat until those chocolate pieces are just melted (about 90 to 100 degrees F on the candy thermometer). Then pour this just-melted chocolate into the other bowl with the un-melted chocolate, stir to combine, and return all of the chocolate to the double boiler and heat to about 105 degrees F. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the ground espresso. You will need to work quickly to spoon the espresso chocolate over the caramel coated bananas, and sprinkle each with a teaspoon of shredded coconut before the chocolate hardens. Allow chocolate to harden, remove carefully from the utility platter using a thin bladed spatula, and serve.'

S"Special equipment: a wok and a hot pot bowl with burnerFor the hot pot broth: Rinse the chickens really well before making the broth. Make sure you rinse out the cavities as well as the outsides to remove as much blood as possible.In a large pot, combine the chickens and 16 cups ice water. Bring to a boil and then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Simmer the broth for 3 hours.Trim the lemongrass stalk, then bruise it by hitting it with the back of a chef\\'s knife, down the length of the stalk. Add to the broth along with the onions, tamarind paste, chile paste, palm sugar, garlic and ginger and simmer for an additional hour.Season the broth with salt and pepper. Add the lime juice and additional chile paste if you want a spicier broth. Strain out the solids and reserve the chicken meat for another use.For the braised oxtail: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the oxtail with the salt and pepper and dredge in the flour.Heat a wok over high heat and add the oil. Working in batches, sear the oxtail pieces until browned. Transfer to an oven-safe casserole dish and fill the casserole dish with enough of the beef broth to cover the oxtail pieces three-quarters of the way. Cover with aluminum foil and place in the oven. Cook until the oxtail is tender, 3 to 4 hours. Allow the oxtail to cool in the braising liquid. Keep the oven temperature at 350 degrees F.For the Vietnamese meatballs: In a large bowl, mix together the beef, pork, onions, scallions, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, soy sauce, salt and pepper. Form 2- to 3-ounce meatballs from the mixture and arrange them on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake the meatballs until fully cooked through, 30 to 45 minutes.For the noodles: Bring 16 cups water to a boil and add the egg noodles. Cook until tender, then drain and rinse in cold water.For plating, arrange the tofu, cabbage, carrots, daikon, watercress, Thai basil and egg noodles around the rim of a large hot pot bowl. Quarter 5 Vietnamese meatballs and add to the rim; add 4 to 6 pieces of oxtail to the rim. Fill the center of the bowl with the hot pot broth and serve family-style over a portable burner."

S'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.To make the olive salsa for the chicken topping, slice the root end off the entire head of garlic and turn it upside down, wrap it in aluminum foil and mold the foil so it supports the garlic to allow the cut end to stand upright in the oven. Pour about 1 teaspoon olive oil on the garlic so it slips between the skin and the cloves and wrap with the foil so it is enclosed. Roast for about 1 hour and set aside until it is cool enough to handle.In a small bowl combine the tomato, basil, parsley, peppercorns, olives and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Gently squeeze the roasted garlic cloves from the skins into the mixture. Fold everything together and set aside to let flavors integrate.For the rice accompaniment to the chicken, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and stir in the basmati rice, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper, allowing rice to toast for a few minutes. Then add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer covered and undisturbed for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.While the rice is cooking begin the sauce for the steak. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan, over medium-high heat, and saute the shallot until it becomes translucent. Add the mushrooms and cook until they are tender and give up their juices. (While the mushrooms are cooling, begin sauteing the bacon in a separate skillet for the potatoes.) Add the merlot and cook for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate small bowl, make a slurry with 1 tablespoon water and the cornstarch, then add the tomato paste and Dijon mustard and mix thoroughly until smooth. Add this mixture to the pan of mushrooms along with demi-glace and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Turn heat down to medium low, and allow to reduce and thicken.While the mushrooms are cooking, heat the oil in the deep-fryer to 375 degrees F or according the manufacturer\\\'s instructions for potatoes. Saute the bacon strips in a skillet until crispy. Remove to paper towels to drain and cool to room temperature. Drain excess bacon fat from the skillet leaving a coating in which to saute the onion. Cook until the onion becomes translucent. Deep-fry the baby potato slices until golden and drain on paper towels. Transfer them to the pan of onions, and crumble in the bacon. Toss in the scallions and season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm.Heat the oven to 375 degrees F for the steak, if you are finishing in the oven.In a large saute pan, heat the chicken stock over medium-high heat. Add the basil, tarragon and parsley, bring to a boil to integrate flavors, then reduce heat. This is your poaching liquid. Season the chicken breasts generously on both sides with salt and pepper, rubbing the seasoning in, and place the chicken in simmering poaching liquid. (Remember, you are poaching, not boiling. The liquid should be kept at a simmer.) Poach chicken until cooked through, about 10 minutes, turning breasts midway through cooking period. Remove to paper towels to drain.Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet with oven-safe handles. Season the steaks with walt and pepper. Sear for about 2 minutes per side undisturbed (to let seasonings integrate into the surface of the meat) and then to your preferred level of doneness. Transfer the entire skillet to the oven to finish (about 10 minutes for medium-rare) They can also be cooked on a grill. Let steaks rest, then slice into 1/4- inch thick slices.On half of the serving plate, spoon some basmati rice, top with a piece of chicken, and spoon olive salsa over chicken. On the other half of the serving plate, spoon some potatoes, top with a "fan" of steak slices (about 3 ounces of steak or an amount equal to half of a strip steak, per person) and drizzle sauce over sliced steak. Garnish the plate with haricots verts.'

The roux should look like "wet sand"; if not, adjust with more butter or flour as necessary. Add the milk and cook and thicken to make a bechamel sauce. (The sauce should be slightly thicker than heavy cream.) Reserve and keep warm.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil; prepare an ice-water bath. Blanch the broccoli florets in the boiling water and immediately transfer to the ice water to stop the cooking process. When cool, drain and set aside.Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Before draining, set aside 1 cup of the pasta water. Drain the pasta and coat with a bit of oil to prevent the pasta from sticking together. Reserve.Heat a saute pan over medium-low heat. Add the grapeseed oil, garlic and onions and cook until transparent. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and zucchini and sweat down a bit. Add the broccoli florets followed by the bechamel sauce and pasta. Toss to combine, adding a little of the reserved pasta water if the sauce seems too thick. Mix in the Parmesan. Add the chives, 2 tablespoons salt and the pepper and toss to combine.Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with the chopped parsley and more Parmesan.'

S'For the guacamole: Combine the cilantro and yellow onion in a blender and blend until almost pureed but still a little chunky.Scoop the flesh out of the avocados and put them in a bowl. Add the onion-cilantro puree and mash the avocados with a fork. Add the tomato, red onion and lime juice and mix well. Season with the salt and cover with plastic wrap directly touching the guacamole.For the vinaigrette: Combine the lime juice, cilantro and honey in a bowl, then slowly whisk in the vegetable oil and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.For the skirt steak: Combine the vegetable oil, olive oil, cilantro and garlic. Pour over the steaks and marinate the steaks  for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.Prepare the grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates. Remove the steak from the marinade. Season with salt and pepper and cook until grill marks appear, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Heat a skillet or saute pan over medium heat on the stovetop. Transfer the marked steak to the skillet and finish cooking on the stovetop over medium heat, flipping once, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Allow the steak to rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing against the grain and on a bias.For plating: Divide the rice among 6 plates. Lay the sliced steak over the top of the rice. Top each plate with a large tablespoon of the guacamole.Combine the watercress and red onions in a bowl and dress them with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette. Toss the watercress salad and divide among the plates, piling it on top of the steak. Spoon 2 to 3 ounces of salsa over the top of each salad.

S"In a large bowl toss the flour with salt and pepper blend, to taste, then add shanks and coat well with the flour. Remove the shanks and shake off the excess flour.Add the oil to a heavy- bottomed pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot add the shanks, and brown them on each side. When fully browned, remove the shanks to a plate and deglaze the pan with red wine. Stir in the carrots, celery, onions, rosemary, beef stock, tomato paste, parsley and garlic. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. When the meat is fork tender, remove the shanks from the stock and allow to cool for 1 hour in the refrigerator.Once cooled, remove meat from shank with a fork, pulling meat to shred.Put the meat into a large bowl and add the orzo, tomatoes and feta. Pour the vinaigrette over the salad and toss to combine. Arrange the salad on a large serving platter and garnish with chopped mint and basil. Drizzle with grapeseed oil and serve.Cook\\'s Note: Lamb loin can be substituted for shank, but will need to be cooked until medium, normally around 20 minutes depending on size."

S'Special equipment:4 (16-ounce) or larger wine glasses or snifters (note that the idea of a trifle is to see the layers)Dissolve gelatin and sugar in boiling water. Add cold water and porter. Cover and set aside at room temperature.For the creme anglaise:Pour the milk and heavy cream into a heavy bottomed saucepot and scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pot (or add vanilla extract). (If using a vanilla bean, put the vanilla pod in the pot as well.) Add half the sugar to the pot and bring to a simmer (just below a boil). In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar and temper it by adding a small amount of the heated milk mixture to the bowl while whisking constantly (known as a liaison). Now pour the liaison (egg mixture) into the milk pot, stirring constantly. You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook. The idea of a liaison is to incorporate the eggs and avoid making them into scrambled eggs! You want the mixture to begin to thicken so it will coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and allow to cool, then remove vanilla pod and discard, and refrigerate until chilled.Spoon fruit cocktail into each glass as a base layer. Follow with a layer of cubed pound cake, then a layer of sliced bananas. Spoon about 1/3 cup gelatin/porter mixture on top of the fruit and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours until the gelatin is set.A few minutes before serving, make the ganache, place the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to just under a boil in a small saucepan. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit for about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir gently with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted and smooth. If the chocolate is not melting readily, nest the bowl in another bowl of very hot tap water.Spoon creme anglaise over the chilled trifle and drizzle with ganache. Spoon whipped cream on top to finish.Serve immediately.'

S"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Roll out the thawed puff pastry until it\\'s about 1/4-inch thick. Using a small heart shaped cutter (about 3 inches at its widest point), cut out 4 heart shapes. Cut out another 4 hearts and using another heart shaped cutter, about 1/2-inch smaller, cut out the center of 4 hearts, leaving just the outsides of the hearts. Throw away the centers or reserve for another use.Brush all the solid heart pieces with beaten egg. Then place a cut-out heart on top of each solid heart and brush with beaten egg. Using a fork, lightly pierce the pastry, (this will help prevent the pastry from bubbling as it bakes).Transfer hearts to a sheet pan and place in the preheated oven. Bake until golden brown and fluffy. Usually around 10 minutes, depending on your oven.Remove from the oven and allow to cool.Peel, core and thinly slice the apples. In a large skillet over medium heat add the sugar and heat until sugar starts to turn a golden color, add the butter and apples and cook until apples are tender but not mushy, around 3 to 5 minutes depending on thickness of apples. Remove from heat.To finish, place the cooked pastry heart in the center of each plate and spoon the cooked apples with the sauce over the hearts.Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and gold leaf."

Remove from oven when the leeks have softened to touch or when the tomatoes have begun to shrivel.In a large nonstick pan, over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons butter and allow the butter to melt. Drizzle the halibut with remaining oil, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Put the halibut in the buttered pan, skin side down, and reduce the heat to medium. Allow the fish to cook for 5 minutes, carefully flip and repeat the cooking process on the second side. After the second side has cooked, remove the halibut to a plate and keep warm. Return the pan to high heat. Stir in the wine with a wooden spoon, to deglaze the pan. Add the lemon juice and chicken stock. This pan sauce should reduce by half, or until thickened. Once the sauce has reduced, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the remaining butter.

S'Prepare the vinaigrette, just before use. Place the lime in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since the lime will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set it aside briefly, until it cools just enough to handle. Pour vinegar into a blender, turn it on, and then squeeze in lime juice from the micro-waved lime. Leaving the blender running, add 1 at a time through the feed opening: mint, mustard, garlic chives, honey, salt, and ground pepper, and blend until smooth. While keeping the blender running, add oil through the feed opening in a slow stream.Heat grill. Brush fennel and mushrooms with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill until they begin to soften, and then allow cooling.Bring a pot of water to boiling. Have a bowl of ice water standing by. Add salt and blanch green beans for 2 to 3 minutes, then stop the cooking by plunging into the ice water.Separate the lettuce into bite size pieces and add to a mixing bowl with oranges, cucumbers, and mint. Slice the fennel and mushrooms and add to the bowl. Add dressing and toss to coat.'

S'In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and stir in apples, raisins, and golden raisins. Saute for about 5 to 7 minutes until they begin to caramelize. Add pears, peaches, vanilla, cinnamon, and brown sugar and cook for 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.If phyllo was defrosted, make sure it is completely defrosted before handling it. Once removed from package, you will need to cover phyllo with waxed paper and a damp towel to prevent it from drying out. Working with 1 sheet at a time, lay out a dough sheet on a baking sheet and brush on butter. Lay another sheet on top and butter again, repeating for all the phyllo sheets, until you have a stack of 10. Start another stack of 10 on a separate baking sheet and butter in between each sheet in the same way.Fold cubed pound cake and bread crumbs into the fruit mixture. (This will absorb enough of the moisture to prevent the phyllo from breaking down.)Spread the fruit mixture evenly over each stack of prepared phyllo and gently roll up the dough from the longest side, folding the ends shut as you go. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake in oven until golden brown, about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely.Serve at room temperature with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and warm caramel sauce.'

S'Special equipment: 2 aluminum half pans, wire roasting rackPreheat the grill on high.Chicken: Poke 6 to 10 holes with a screwdriver through the top of 1 aluminum pan, and put the water soaked chips in bottom of second aluminum pan and top with a wire roasting rack. Put the pan with soaked chips on the preheated grill until a solid burn occurs, about 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-high. In a large bowl blend all the seasonings with the grapeseed oil. Toss the chicken with the blended seasoning, arrange on the rack in the smoker and cover with the aluminum pan with the holes. Smoke the chicken until an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the chicken, about 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let cool. After cooling, remove the skin, and shred the smoked breast by hand. Discard the bones.Bisque: In a medium saucepan, over medium-high heat, melt the butter and add the celery and onions, stirring throughout until the onions are translucent. Add the flour, and stir with a wooden spoon until the flour and butter become a paste (pan roux). Reduce the heat and add the stock, milk and cream. Cook until the mixture has thickened, about 20 minutes. Add the parsley, shrimp, garlic and shredded chicken and continue cooking for 10 minutes over low heat. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Ladle into serving bowls and serve.'

Once simmering, remove from the heat and whisk in some butter. Hold warm in the pan until serving.For the steaks: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the onions and seasoning blend, stirring with a wooden spoon until the onions are translucent and slightly browned on the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. After caramelizing the onions, sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper on both sides. Then add to the skillet and sear on both sides, 5 to 6 minutes.Once seared, remove the onions from the skillet and finish the steaks in the oven to desired temperature. They will be medium-rare to medium with oven cooking. Once the steaks are finished, sauce each plate with 1 to 2 ounces of sauce. Place steaks in center and finish with the onions.'

S'For the wings: Whisk together the buttermilk, salt, chili powder, black pepper, thyme and cayenne in a large bowl. Add the wings and refrigerate for 6 hours.For the ham hock gravy: Combine the ham hocks and 2 quarts water in a large pot, bring to a simmer and cook for 3 hours. Add the celery, carrot and onion and simmer for 1 more hour.Strain the stock and keep the ham hocks. Pick the meat off the ham hocks and reserve for the gravy.Return the stock to the pot, bring to a boil and cook until reduced to 1 quart, about 30 minutes.Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to make a roux. Cook the roux, stirring, until it gets a nice nutty brown color, about 5 minutes.Slowly whisk the reduced stock into the roux to avoid lumps. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring regularly, for 5 minutes. Add the ham hock meat and heavy cream, season with salt and pepper and continue to simmer for 15 minutes more.For the waffle batter: Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs and melted butter.Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk to combine. Some lumps in the batter are acceptable but not too many.Preheat a Belgian-waffle iron and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the batter into the center of the waffle iron (depending on the size of the waffle iron) and close. Cook until the waffle is golden brown, 3 to 6 minutes, depending on the iron. Repeat with the remaining batter.For the wing breading: Preheat the oil to 325 degrees F in a deep pot or deep fryer.  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl or plate.Working with 3 to 4 wings at a time, dredge the wings in the flour and fry until the thickest part of the wing reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 10 minutes. As the wings are cooked, transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in the oven.To plate: Place a hot waffle on each of 6 plates. Stack 3 wings on top of each. Divide the gravy among the plates and garnish with the chopped scallions.'

Deglaze the pan with wine and add the leeks, cooking gently until the liquid is almost all gone. Make a slurry by gradually adding the cornstarch to the cream, and then whisk in the Parmesan. When the wine has mostly evaporated, stir the slurry mixture into the leeks, season with salt and pepper, and reduce heat to a simmer to allow reducing and thickening. Set aside in a warm place.Slice each fish fillet in half lengthwise. In a plastic bag, shake together cornmeal, flour, garlic pepper seasoning, and salt. Moisten fish by dipping in milk and shake in bag to coat with cornmeal mixture. Heat olive oil and butter over medium heat in a large skillet, and cook each side of coated fish until golden brown. Do not overcook the fish - it is done when it springs back upon gentle prodding.Spoon some leek ragout in the middle of serving plate, top with tilapia, and garnish with parsley and lemon slices.'

Gradually, add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly to remove any lumps. Set aside.Cook\\'s Note: Different flour absorbs different amounts of liquid so be patient and add slowly. While the batter is resting, preheat the grapeseed oil in a deep heavy skillet, over medium heat, to around 350 degrees F. Make sure, for safety, that the oil only comes 3/4 of the way up the pan.For the kebobs:Alternate the vegetables and tofu on the skewers to form a colorful stick of vegetables.In a large shallow dish and the flour and season it with salt and pepper, to taste. Gently roll the tofu and vegetable skewers in the flour, coating it well and shaking off any excess flour. Dip the skewers into the tempura mix, and let the excess batter drip back into the bowl. Add the skewers to the hot oil, in batches if necessary, and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve with a simple dipping sauce of soy sauce and chopped chives, if desired. Enjoy."

Rub the skins with the clarified butter. Truss the chickens.Place the chickens, breast side up, on a rack set into a roasting pan. Roast until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and scatter the onions, carrots and celery around the chickens. Roast until the chickens are 160 degrees at the thigh, 45 to 60 minutes more. Remove to a cutting board and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.Place the roasting pan on the stovetop and cook until the vegetables are caramelized. Pour off all but 2 ounces of the chicken fat. Add the flour and cook for 2 minutes, whisking. Whisk the stock into the roux until smooth, then simmer for 20 minutes. Season the pan gravy with salt and pepper. Before serving, whisk the unsalted butter into the gravy.Cut the chickens in half and remove the backbone.For the sweet potato puree: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Pierce the skins of the sweet potatoes with a fork.

Set up an ice bath for shocking the green beans.Add one-third of the green beans to the boiling water; cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to the ice bath to stop cooking. Remove the beans from the ice bath and dry well. Repeat two more times, until all the green beans are blanched.Heat 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil in a large skillet. Add the blanched green beans and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the butter and the almonds, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.To plate: Divide the sweet potato puree between 6 plates, and make a smear with the puree.

S'In a large stockpot, heat grapeseed oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add onion and saute until it turns translucent. Add beer and let cook until most of the alcohol evaporates. Stir in broccoli florets and disks, and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and cook until broccoli is very soft.While the soup is cooking, make the topping for the croutons. Gently fold cream cheese, eggs, and bacon bits together, cover and refrigerate until needed.Stir heavy cream into the soup, remove from heat, and puree with an immersion blender. Stir in shredded Cheddar and whipped cream cheese, cover and let sit for about 5 minutes to allow the cheese to melt. Use the immersion blender to thoroughly mix, and adjust salt and pepper, to taste, if necessary. Cover and keep warm.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Toast what bread and cut into triangles. Sprinkle some cheddar cheese on each toast triangle and top with some of the egg/bacon mixture. Sprinkle some more Cheddar on top, place on a baking sheet and put in the oven for a few minutes to let the cheese melt.Serve soup in crocks with a crouton floating on the surface of the soup.'

S'For the relish: In a bowl, blend the corn, green onions, yellow onions, vinegar, vegetable juice and some salt and pepper, mixing well. Hold in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour to marinate.For the grits: Warm the chicken stock in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring stock to a simmer, then add the salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium. Next slowly add the grits. Whisking continuously, cook until thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Once cooked, taste and season with salt and pepper. Then hold warm for serving.For the sauce: Heat a pan with the grapseed oil. Then add the onions and cook until caramelized, 3 minutes. After cooking the onions, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the apple juice. Allow the juice to reduce for 1 minute, then add the pepper puree. Stir to incorporate the flavors and simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat.For the fish: Heat a heavy-bottom pan over high heat. Add the grapeseed oil and warm for 2 minutes. Then sprinkle the skin-side of the fish with the blackening seasoning and sear on the skin side for 3 minutes. After "blackening" the skin side, flip, reduce the heat and cook for another 3 minutes on the fleshy side. When fully cooked, scoop 2 ounces of the sauce on a plate followed by some grits. Top with the cooked fish. Finally top a corner of the fish with some relish.'

Using a spoon or a melon baller, remove the inside seeds and pulp 2/3 of the way into the cucumber, forming a "shooter" glass. Put in a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.In a large bowl combine all the remaining ingredients, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. This will give the soup time to meld all the flavors together and let the juices from the vegetables mix.When ready to serve, spoon the soup into the cucumber shooter glasses and serve. Let your guests enjoy the soup, then eat the "so called shooter glass".A great refreshing chilled soup.'

S'For the sauce: In a sauce pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the onions and garlic and saute until tender. Add the chili powder, coriander, cumin, dry mustard and cayenne, and saute for 2 minutes while stirring to toast the spices. Deglaze the pan with the vinegar and wine. Whisk in the ketchup and bring the sauce to a boil and add half of the blueberries. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the sauce for 30 minutes, stirring regularly to avoid burning.Puree the sauce with an immersion blender, and then add the remaining blueberries. Simmer for another 5 minutes and keep warm for plating.For the cornbread cakes: In a mixing bowl combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt and baking soda, and stir to combine. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, butter and egg, and whisk. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Rest the batter for 30 minutes.On a skillet set over medium-high heat, heat some oil and pour silver-dollar-size portions of the batter on the skillet. Allow the cakes to cook until golden brown on the first side, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook to golden brown on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the skillet to a paper-towel-lined pate to absorb any grease.For the carrots: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F with a large saute pan or a baking sheet in it.In a bowl, toss the carrots with the oil, salt and pepper. Remove the hot pan from the oven and spread the carrots onto the pan. The carrots should sizzle when they hit the pan. Quickly place the pan back in the oven and cook until the carrots are tender, about 15 minutes.For plating: Heat a skillet to high heat. Sprinkle the red fish fillets with salt and pepper on both sides.Heat some grape seed oil on the skillet until it just begins to smoke. Lay the fillets on the skillet, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases from the skillet. Do not over crowd the pan, cook the fish in batches.In a saute pan melt the butter and toss the blanched asparagus and roasted carrots until hot. Season with salt and pepper.Spoon 1 to 2 ounces of the BBQ sauce onto one side of the plate and drag the sauce to the other side of the plate. Layer 3 cornbread cakes going in the opposite direction of the sauce. Lay 3 pieces of fish over the cakes and then lean 4 pieces of asparagus and 4 pieces of carrots on one side of the fish. Drizzle the fish with another 1 ounce of the BBQ sauce, and then serve.'

S'Microwave lime in a small bowl for about 30 seconds to release essential oils, and set aside until it is just cool enough to handle. Prepare salsa by combining tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, mango, parsley, serrano pepper, and garlic. When the lime is just cooled down enough to handle, cut it in half, remove any seeds and squeeze the lime juice into the salsa. Season with salt and pepper, stir to combine and set aside.Blanch the green beans for about 2 minutes in salted water, drain and let cool.Prepare the dressing. Through the feed opening of a running blender add, 1 at a time, rice wine vinegar, ground ginger, garlic and parsley until a smooth paste forms. Leaving the blender running, add the olive oil in a slow stream through the feed opening.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.Gently fold the cooled green beans with the salsa, radishes, tomatoes, and red onion. Use enough of the dressing to coat, but do not feel compelled to use all of the dressing. You can serve the rest of the dressing on the side.'

S'Cut off and discard the tough stem root of the frisee. Tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. Put the leaves in a large bowl and toss with the olive oil, vinegar and a sprinkling of salt and pepper.Tomato Tartan:Prepare the pastry by combining the flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor. Add the butter and combine until coarse crumbs are formed. With the machine running, add ice water, tablespoon by tablespoon, and keep the machine going until the dough rolls off the sides of the container into a ball. Cover the pastry with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Use this time to slice the tomatoes and cheese.  Roll out the dough with a little flour into a circle large enough to fit into a 10 inch tart pan or a pie pan. The dough will be about 1/8-inch thick.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Evenly brush the mustard over the bottom of the pastry shell tucking in the edges. Cover the mustard with all the cheese, distributing it evenly. Beginning at the outer edge of the crust, make a spiral of overlapping tomato slices, working your way around to the center. In a bowl, mix the garlic, herbs and olive oil. Drizzle this mixture over the tomatoes.Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from oven, let rest and serve atop frisee salad'

S'Pour brandy over nectarines and soak for about 30 minutes.For the lemon cream: Pour the milk and heavy cream into a heavy bottomed saucepot and add vanilla and lemon liqueur. Add half the sugar to the pot and bring to a simmer (just below a boil). In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar and temper it by adding a small amount of the heated milk mixture to the bowl while whisking constantly (known as a liaison). Now pour the liaison (egg mixture) into the milk pot, stirring constantly. You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook. The idea of a liaison is to incorporate the eggs and avoid making them into scrambled eggs! You want the mixture to begin to thicken so it will coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and whisk in lemon zest, and allow to cool, then remove vanilla pod and discard, and refrigerate until chilled.Place nectarines cut side up in a pan and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Spoon brandy around nectarines, cover and heat nectarines and brandy briefly. Then remove cover and spoon warmed brandy over nectarines. * Remove from the heat and ignite with a long match to flambe. Alternatively, you can grill the brandy soaked nectarines until they begin to caramelize. Allow nectarines to cool to room temperature.Place 2 nectarines on each serving dish, and top with lemon cream and blackberries.'

Remove the conch to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.To the saute pan add the remaining grapeseed oil. Add the olives, garlic, tomatoes, capers and thyme, and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes. Remove the olive mixture from the pan and pour over the conch. Return the pan to medium heat.

S'Early in the day, rinse pork loin to remove any unwanted smells and pat dry with paper toweling. In a large saute pan, heat the oil and sear the pork loin on all sides.  Remove pork to a utility platter and coat liberally with mustard, then roll in Smokey Rotisserie Seasoning. Leave refrigerated for a couple of hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.In a large saucepan, bring the 5 cups vegetable stock (for the rice) to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Transfer the pork loin to a covered roasting pan and slowly roast in the oven until fork tender, about 45 minutes. Allow pork loin to rest for 8 to 10 minutes before slicing.For the risotto:While the pork is in the oven, in another large saucepan or rondelle, heat the grapeseed oil and saute the chopped onion gently until translucent. Add the Arborio rice and using a wooden spoon stir to coat the rice with oil and to toast the rice in the pan. Add the white wine, bay leaves, and saffron and continue to stir to avoid sticking. Begin slowly adding the now hot vegetable broth, 1  ladle at a time, to the rice pan, stirring occasionally. This will bring out the starch in the rice. As the mixture absorbs the broth, ladle more into the pot. When all of the broth has been ladled into the rice pot, slowly simmer until rice begins to soften. Reduce the heat and gently stir in the chives, Parmesan, and crabmeat, trying not to break up the lumps of crab. Remove from heat when it is slightly undercooked and set aside. Rice will continue to cook in covered pot.For the sauce:Heat the grapeseed oil in a saute pan and cook the red, yellow and green bell peppers and onion until al dente. Add the red wine and let it reduce by half. Pour in 1/2 cup vegetable stock and let reduce again. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Remove pan from heat and whisk in butter to finish sauce.Place crab risotto in the middle of serving plate, place pork slices over the risotto and cover with a little sauce. Garnish with chopped parsley.'

S'Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. ("Proofing" the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn\\\'t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes. Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to an hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time.While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza topping. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium- high heat in a large saucepan and saute garlic and onions until they begin to soften. Add parsley, salt, and tomatoes. Cook for about 20 minutes to allow flavors to integrate. (Begin the chicken as described below, while the sauce is cooking.) Remove from heat and whisk in instant flour to thicken. Mix with an immersion blender, then set aside briefly.While the sauce is cooking, in a separate fry pan, heat the other tablespoon of olive oil over medium high heat, and brown the ground chicken, breaking up the pieces as it cooks. When the ground chicken has browned, remove from heat, crumble in blue cheese, and stir in buffalo wing sauce and yogurt. Fold this mixture into the tomato sauce. If the mix is absolutely too runny for a pizza topping, add more instant flour.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Divide the dough in half and stretch out 2 (14-inch) circles. Transfer them to pizza stones sprinkled with cornmeal. Top with the buffalo chicken pizza topping. Roll up and seal ends. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the dough is nicely browned.'

Whisk in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Add the tomatoes, watermelon and mint and toss with the vinaigrette.For the onion rings: Heat the oil in a heavy pan until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Put the flour in a medium bowl. Drain the onion rings completely, and then toss in the flour to coat. Tap off any excess flour, and then fry the onions until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel, and then season lightly with salt and pepper.To cook the flank steak, preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, draining off any excess. (Removal of excess marinade will prevent flaming or charring of the steak during cooking.) Grill over high heat until medium rare, 8 to 9 minutes per side. Allow the steak to rest before slicing against the grain into thin slices.Shingle some sliced steak on each plate. Spoon the watermelon salad on top. Garnish with onion rings and cilantro sprigs.'

S"Stir the sugar, salt and yeast into the warm water and allow to proof for about 15 minutes. The yeast will be activated and have the appearance of a head of beer. If it does not, it should be discarded and replaced with fresh yeast. (Improper storage temperature will sometimes destroy yeast even if the date on the package indicates it has not yet expired.)Add the flour and nutmeg to a food processor fitted with a dough blade (or the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook). Turn on the food processor and through the feed tube, gradually add the yeast mixture. (Or turn on the mixer and gradually add the yeast mixture to the bowl of flour.) Then add the olive oil and eggs. Mix until the dough comes together.Transfer the dough to a large bowl and cover with a clean damp towel. Let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. Punch down the dough and let it rise a second time in the same way. This will make the texture of the dough finer. Please note that the dough will not rise as much the second time. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. or as directed on the manufacturer\\'s instructions for similar foods. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled marble slab and knead for a few minutes. Divide the dough into eighths. Divide each eighth into thirds and roll into a cylinder about 1/2-inch in diameter and 8 inches long.  Connect the 2 ends of the cylinder and press firmly to make a circle. Grab the circle on each side and twist twice. Add zeppole to basket immersed in oil in deep-fryer and fry until golden.

S'For the provencal sauce: In a large saucepot, heat the grapeseed oil over medium-low heat. Add the tomatoes, garlic and onions and sweat until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Deglaze with the white wine and simmer briefly. Add the chicken stock, tomato juice and tomato paste and cook an additional 3 minutes. Season with a pinch of kosher salt and black pepper. Reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook until the sauce slightly thickens.For the frog legs: Mix together the flour, 2 tablespoons salt and 1 tablespoon pepper in a shallow bowl.

S'A steaming rack4-inch circle or biscuit cutter3-inch circle or biscuit cutterSeason salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place a steaming rack in a saucepan or pot and fill with a couple of inches of water. Cover and let salmon steam until the fish flakes. Then set aside to cool.Begin the lobster bisque sauce. Melt the butter over medium heat in a saucepan, add the shallot saute and saute until translucent. Whisk in the flour to make a roux. Add the brandy and gradually whisk in the stock. Let reduce by half. Whisk in heavy cream and remove from heat.While the lobster bisque sauce is reducing, make the vol-au-vent. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out puff pastry dough, and using a 4-inch circle or biscuit cutter, cut out 8 dough rounds. Place 4 of the dough rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet. Using a 3 inch circle or biscuit cutter, cut a concentric circle in the middle of the remaining 4 inch dough rounds to create a half-inch wide circle of dough. These half-inch wide circles of dough are to be used without the 3- inch pieces from the center. Place 1 of these half-inch wide circles of dough on top of each of the rounds already on the baking sheet, matching up the edges. Brush egg wash over the surface of each of the paired dough circles and rounds. Then use a fork to prick through the dough around the perimeter (that is, through each dough circle and into the accompanying round beneath it). Place in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. The center of each will rise. Remove pastry shells from oven and allow to cool slightly.Flake the now cooled salmon into chunks and fold sauce into the salmon. (Do not feel compelled to use all of the sauce. The filling should not be too liquid.) Spoon some into each of the pastry shells. Sprinkle with fresh dill and top with 1/4 teaspoon caviar.'

Place the chicken breasts in the pan skin-side down, making sure not to overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if needed. Sear one side of the chicken until nicely browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn the chicken over and finish cooking until cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F., 3 to 4 minutes.For the chimichurri: Combine the grapeseed oil, parsley, vinegar, cilantro, honey, oregano, garlic, shallot, red pepper flakes and salt in a food processor and process slowly. Add the extra-virgin olive oil and mix to combine. The final product should be smooth but have a bit of texture to it.For the sweet potatoes: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the grapeseed oil and allow it to heat up. Add the sweet potatoes and cook on high to sear, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook the the potatoes, stirring regularly, until tender, about 20 minutes.Add the chili powder and cayenne and saute for 1 to 2 minutes to toast the spices. Add the molasses and cook, stirring, until glazed, 3 to 4 minutes. The potatoes should be tender but not falling apart.Just before serving, heat the sweet potatoes over high heat and add the kale. Cook until the kale is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.To plate: Divide the sweet potatoes and kale among 6 plates, placing the vegetables in the center of the plates. Lay the chicken breast over the sweet potatoes. Spoon about 2 ounces of the chimichurri over each of the chicken breast. Garnish with the chopped parsley.'

S'For the flour: In a bowl combine the flour, chili powder, dry thyme, salt and pepper and mix to disperse the seasoning throughout the flour.For the egg wash: In a bowl combine the buttermilk and eggs, and whisk to combine.For the sauce: In a bowl combine the mayo, capers and lemon juice, and mix. Season with salt and pepper, being very careful with the salt as the capers are already salty.For the sandwich: Preheat enough oil to come 2 to 3 inches up the side of a medium saucepot over medium-high heat, until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 350 degrees F.Dredge the fish in the egg wash then in the seasoned flour. Dip in the egg wash again and the flour again. Carefully float the fish in the hot oil and cook until golden brown. Remove from the oil and rest the fish on paper towels to drain excess oil.Set a skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat, and heat the grapeseed oil (you may have to do this in batches so portion out the oil for how many batches it will take to toast all of the buns). Toast the buns until golden brown.Spread 1 tablespoon of the caper sauce on both sides of the toasted buns and 1 tablespoon of the ketchup on the top half of each bun.Season the tomato slices with salt and pepper and arrange 2 slices on the bottom halves of each bun. Place some shredded lettuce on top of the tomatoes. Place 3 to 4 onion rings on top of the lettuce. Cut the fish in half and stack the 2 pieces of fish on top of each bun and top with the top half of the bun. Serve each sandwich with a lemon wedge.'

S'If you are making your own pastry dough, aerate the flour by sifting it together with the salt and sugar into a large bowl. Add butter in pieces and rub it in with your fingertips until you reach a texture similar to fine bread crumbs. (Try to keep your hands cool). Add cold water gradually, mixing only enough water as you need to make the dough form. Form the dough into a disk (for ease of handling), and place it in a bowl covered with plastic or a clean damp towel, and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. When rested, roll the pastry out onto a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin, to a thickness of about 1/8-inch and line a well buttered 9 1/2-inch flan pan with a removable bottom. Trim away any excess pastry hanging over the edge of the pan. Place pastry shell into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the base of the chilled pastry shell with parchment paper. Then fill with ceramic pastry weights (or dried beans) and place on a baking tray in the oven and partially bake ("blind bake") for 25 minutes. Remove the weights/beans, prick the base of pastry to prevent bubbling-up of base, and return to the oven for a further 5 minutes to dry out the base. Remove pastry shell from oven and allow to cool. Also allow oven to cool to 350 degrees F.While the pastry shell is cooling, prepare the sponge cake batter:Heat the milk over low heat. Add the butter and let it melt into the milk. Set the pot aside temporarily. Beat the sugar and eggs in a large bowl with an electric beater until it is about triple in volume and is the consistency of soft whipped cream. Return the pot with the milk to the stovetop and heat until hot. Sift cake flour and baking powder together several times to aerate. Sift the 1/3 of the flour and baking powder into the bowl of beaten eggs and sugar, and fold together. Repeat for each remaining third of the flour mixture, folding together after the addition of each third. Then, add the hot milk and butter all at once and fold in.For the filling and topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Spread the jam over the base of the cooled pastry shell and pour the cake batter over the top of the layer of jam. Then sprinkle the surface of the cake batter with coconut. Bake in oven for 20 to 25 minutes until the surface springs back when touched and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes. Then while wearing oven mitts, push base of tin upwards from bottom to release tart from sides of pan. You may want to use a spatula to also slide the tart off the base onto your serving plate; however, if it starts to break apart, the nearly invisible base of the flan pan enables you to use it for service with little consequence to your presentation.'

S"Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, mushrooms, celery and garlic and saute until tender. Add the flour and form a roux, stirring to incorporate the butter and flour.Slowly add the vegetable stock and stir until smooth. Continue to cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. If the sauce looks too thick you can add more stock or water to thin it down.Add all the blanched vegetables to the sauce along with the fresh herbs. Cook for 5 minutes, gently stirring, over medium heat. Add the mascarpone and heavy cream and allow to reduce for another 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper. While the sauce is simmering, add the canola oil to a large skillet, over medium heat, until smoking.  Slice the bread into triangles and shallow-fry on both sides until golden brown. Remove from the oil, drain on paper towels and set aside. To serve, place a ladle of vegetable stew into each large soup bowl and garnish with fried toast points.Cook\\'s Note: Blanching vegetable is a great way to speed up the cooking process of any dish and is very simple to do. Simply cook vegetables in boiling salted water until vegetables are still firm but cooked, then remove from boiling water and place into a bowl of iced water to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside until ready to use."

S'Heat grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion turns translucent. Reduce heat to medium and add the zucchini, yellow squash, oregano, salt, and pepper, and stir to coat. Cover and gently cook for about 15 minutes, then add the corn, cover and cook for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, make a slurry by adding the flour to a small bowl and gradually whisking in 3 tablespoons of the milk (reserving the rest of the milk for the eggs). Whisk tomato paste into the slurry until smooth. Gently stir the slurry into the squash mixture to thicken. Further cook uncovered until the squash is tender and the flour is "cooked out," about 5 more minutes. Remove pan from heat and let cool to room temperature.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat butter over medium heat in another large skillet (or the same one if you have removed the vegetables and washed it). In a small bowl whisk 2 eggs and 1 tablespoon milk together at a time (reserving the rest of the eggs and milk). Spread the melted butter over the bottom of the pan and pour in the eggs, swirling to coat the bottom. Cook as you would a crepe, loosening the edges and flipping to brown both sides. When just cooked, transfer to the bottom of a lasagne dish as the bottom layer and trim and rearrange the egg to fit. Spoon 1/4 of the squash mixture evenly over the eggs, followed by 1/4 of the sliced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese. Repeat by whisking 2 more eggs with 1 tablespoon of milk and cooking to make a sheet of egg for the next layer, followed by squash, tomato and cheese each time, until you have completed 4 layers.Heat in the oven for about 20 minutes until the cheese is melted. Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes before slicing into squares.Serve sprinkled with a dollop of sour cream and minced fresh parsley.'

S"Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a saucepan. You will be using it as a court bouillon - a poaching liquid for the shrimp. The court bouillon is not actually part of the soup. Poach the shrimp in their shells until just pink and remove to a platter to cool. (Shrimp cooked in its shell retains more flavor).While the shrimp are cooling, combine the cucumbers, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, tomatillos, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon in a food processor and pulse to coarsely chop. Remove to a bowl and squeeze in the juice of the fresh lemon, being careful not to drop any remaining lemon seeds into the mix. Add the chopped chives, and stir to combine.Peel the shrimp and finely dice. Stir the shrimp into the fruit/vegetable mixture and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Chill well.In the episode, we served this gazpacho as an hors d\\'oeuvres in porcelain Chinese spoons. You can do the same or be creative by using your own choice of individual serving vessel such as sake cups, rice bowls or even 2 ounce ramekins with demitasse spoons. It can also be served as an appetizer in soup bowls."

Add zucchini and cook for 5 more minutes. Set aside. In a medium pot combine tomato sauce and red wine and bring to a boil over medium-low heat. Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, to taste. If desired, add more spices to your liking. (I usually add dry oregano, basil, and parsley). Reduce heat to low, cover and let it simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a large bowl mixing together the ricotta, mozzarella and romano cheeses. Add eggs, pumpkin puree and salt and pepper, to taste. Mix very well. You might want to add more spices to the filling. (You can add a pinch of cinnamon and it gave it a different flavor.)   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Build your lasagna in a large (9 by 12-inch) baking dish starting with a layer of sauce, a layer of pasta, a layer of half the sausage and a layer of half the filling. Add another layer of pasta, sauce, the remaining sausage and the filling. Finish with a layer of pasta and a layer of sauce. Sprinkle some mozzarella cheese on top and bake for 25 minutes.

Prepare a rub by combining Smokey Rotisserie Seasoning, garlic powder, salt and black pepper in a small bowl and rubbing over entire surface of brisket. Follow manufacturer\\'s instructions for the smoker. General rule of thumb is to maintain a temperature range of 255 to 300 degrees F (indirect heat), and smoke for 1 to 1 1/2 hours per pound of meat (4 to 6 hours for a 4-pound brisket). Towards the end of the smoking time, combine the barbecue sauce and brown sugar in a small bowl and spread on the brisket.Just before serving, glaze with honey and serve family style."

S'For the ginger pickled carrots: Combine the sugar, vinegar and 2 cups water in a pot and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Pour into a plastic container and let cool completely.Once cooled, add the carrots and ginger to the pickling liquidmake sure they are completely covered by the liquid. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours before using (24 hours is best).For the sweet potato puree: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pierce the skins of the sweet potatoes and bake until tender, about 45 minutes. (Leave the oven on for heating up the tortillas.)Once cooked, cut the sweet potatoes in half and scoop the flesh into a food processor. Add the butter and honey and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Hold hot until ready to plate.For the tuna: Combine the Cajun seasoning and salt, and mix. Sprinkle the tuna pieces with the spice mixture. Heat a large saute pan over high heat until the pan begins to smoke. Add the grapeseed oil to the pan and then sear the tuna on two sides, leaving it rare in the center. Remove the tuna from the pan and let rest for 5 minutes.For the guacamole: Scoop the avocado flesh into a bowl. Add the red onions, tomatoes, cilantro and lime juice, and mash with a fork to combine. Season with salt and pepper.To build the taco: Heat the tortillas in the oven just until warm, not crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the sweet potato puree onto each tortilla. Add a piece of tuna, then top with about 1 ounce of the pickled carrots and 1 tablespoon of the guacamole. Garnish with two sprigs of cilantro and serve.'

Add the blueberries, and mix well, being careful not to crush all the berries. In second bowl with a whisk, blend the cream, half-and-half, and the egg. Stir in the flour mixture and mix until the dough comes together. This is our scone dough. Remove the scone dough from bowl and knead on floured counter, rolling 5 to 6 times, ensuring not to over blend; this will result in a tough dough. Divide the dough into 12 even triangular shape portions. Arrange on a cookie sheet and bake until the tops are slightly browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer the scones to a serving platter.'

S'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the pepper in a roasting pan and roast in the oven, checking every 15 minutes, and turning with tongs until the skin is fully wrinkled and charred black. When the peppers is done, use tongs to put it into a ziptop bag which (for safety reasons) you have resting on a plate - (Remember, it is volcanically hot!). Carefully zip the bag shut, and allow the pepper to sweat for 5 minutes. Use oven mitts to prevent getting burned while you handle the bag in the next step of sliding the pepper from the bag into a bowl filled with a couple of inches of ice water. You can then use your fingers to work quickly to slip off and discard the skin of the pepper while it is in the water. You will be left with a beautifully cooked red pepper with a wonderful color. Cut open the pepper and remove seeds. Slice it into strips and set aside.Roll out each puff pastry sheet and on the surface of each of the 2 sheets evenly arrange 4 slices of prosciutto ham, 6 spinach leaves, half of the red pepper strips, 1/8-cup Cheddar, and 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Roll up the dough "jelly roll" style into a log (so the cross-section of the roll will be a spiral design, the "pinwheel").  Place the logs in the freezer for 50 minutes.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove "pinwheel" logs and from freezer and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices and place on a baking sheet. Brush with egg wash. Bake until golden brown, approximately 15 minutes.'

S'In a large saucepan, bring seafood stock to a boil. Once boiling, add salt, bay leaves, and lobster meat. Cook lobster only until it is opaque. Do not overcook lobster as it will get tough. Remove lobster with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain, reserving cooking liquid. Remove bay leaves from liquid and discard.For the grits:Melt the butter in a saucepan, and add garlic and scallions, cooking them until they become tender. Stir in the grits, and toast lightly in the pan, then add the cooking liquid from the lobster and simmer until the grits are cooked, about 20 minutes. (The grits should be fluffy.)While the grits are cooking, cook bacon in a large skillet until crispy and golden brown, then remove to paper toweling to drain. Pour off most of the fat from the pan. To the same pan which now has a coating of bacon fat, add the mushrooms, onion, garlic, thyme, tomatoes, and parsley. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to integrate flavors, then return bacon pieces to pan and add white wine. Let wine reduce by half while grits are cooking.  To finish, gently fold lobster, lime juice, and Parmesan into grits. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Transfer lobster grits to serving dish and spoon mushroom wine sauce around. Garnish with parsley and lemon wedges.'

S'Hydrate bread crumbs in a mixing bowl by pouring water (1/2 to 3/4 cup) over them.To cook en papillote (in the oven, enclosed in foil), use a large foil oven pouch, or make an oven pouch out of a 3 foot length of heavy duty foil by bringing the 2 ends to the center, folding the sides to seal, and leaving an opening at the center through which to place the sauce and meatballs. Shake flour in the pouch to coat the inside, and (for safety reasons) place in a roasting pan. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. To cook en papillote on the grill, follow the same procedure with the foil pouch and preheat grill to medium-high heat. (The foil pouch method is great for cooking and cleanup, but because the liquids inside will become very hot, use a roasting pan to support the weight of the pouch for safety reasons.)To the bowl of hydrated bread crumbs, add ground beef, onion, egg, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and allspice. With an electric mixer, beat the meat mixture until fluffy. Heat oil in a large skillet to sear off meatballs. (In the episode, we seared the meatballs in a deep-fryer.) Form meat mixture into small meatballs, and sear them in the skillet or deep-fryer. Remove to paper toweling to drain briefly. Add butter, beef stock, sherry, cream and bay leaf to foil pouch (which you have placed into a roasting pan for safety reasons to support the weight of the "floppy" pouch). Transfer meatballs to the oven pouch and seal the pouch. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or grill for about 15 to 20 minutes. Use extra care in dealing with the hot liquids in the foil pouch or oven bag. Pour the sauce from the bag into a small saucepan.  Remove bay leaf from sauce before serving. Whisk in Dijon mustard and honey mustard and heat for a few minutes to thicken, and serve with meatballs.'

S'For the beer-braised chicken: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Season the chicken with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper.Add the grapeseed oil to the skillet and sear the chicken thighs on all sides until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Do not overcrowd the pan or the chicken will steam instead of sear; work in batches if necessary. Transfer the chicken to an oven-safe casserole dish with the onion, carrots and celery.Add the beer to the drippings in the skillet and cook, scraping up the bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the chicken stock and brown sugar and bring to a simmer. Season the braising liquid with salt and pepper. Pour the braising liquid over the chicken and cover the pan with foil.Transfer the casserole dish to the oven and cook until the chicken is tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, remove the foil and allow the chicken to cool in the braising liquid. Shred the chicken meat.For the vinaigrette: In a blender, combine the lime juice, chili sauce, vinegar, mustard, garlic and oregano and puree. Slowly add the olive and vegetable oils while the blender is running. Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper.For the salad: Arrange a layer of the lettuce leaves on each plate. Spread 1/4 cup each of the tomatoes, olives, Cheddar and chicken over the lettuce. Drizzle with some vinaigrette and then repeat with an additional layer of lettuce, tomatoes, olives, Cheddar and chicken. Add a final drizzle of vinaigrette and serve with the guacamole, sour cream and tortilla chips on the side.'

S"Dissolve yeast and salt in warm water and allow it to proof. The mixture should develop foam at the top which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn\\'t, the yeast is dead and should be discarded. This process takes about 15 minutes.Sift the flour into a large bowl and gradually mix in the lard with your fingers. Then gradually add the yeast mixture and mix until the flour is moistened. Turn onto a floured board and knead into a cohesive mass. Place into a bowl, cover with a damp kitchen towel and place in a warm place to allow the dough to rise. This will take 30 to 45 minutes.Punch the dough down, cover with the towel again and let sit in a warm place for another 30 minutes or so to allow to rise again. Note: the dough will not rise as much the second time.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Transfer dough to a floured board and form into 2 or 3 loaves or bars. Place in a greased pan and brush the top of the dough with oil. Bake for 30 to 50 minutes until golden brown. The baked loaves should sound hollow when tapped."

S'For the BBQ sauce: Mix the ketchup, vinegar, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper in a bowl. Then transfer to a thick-bottomed saucepot over medium-low heat. Allow the sauce to warm, and mix over the heat for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring throughout the time. Then remove and cool until usage.For the spice rub: In a bowl, mix the salt, ground mustard, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, white pepper, seafood seasoning and cumin together with a spoon. After mixing, keep dry and covered.To prep the ribs, remove the silver skin from the bottom side of the ribs. Then evenly rub each rack with 1/4 cup of the spice rub on top and bottom. Wrap each rack in plastic wrap and keep overnight in the refrigerator or cooler.To smoke the ribs, heat a smoker with pecan or other fruit wood, bringing the smoker or pit to 165 degrees F and maintaining temperature. Once the temperature is obtained, remove the plastic and place the ribs in the smoker for 4 hours, keeping for doneness at this point. The ribs should be cooked, but not falling off the bone.To glaze the ribs, remove them from the pit and glaze each rack with 1/2 cup of the BBQ sauce. Then return to the pit for 30 to 40 minutes.  Again, remove and glaze with additional 1/2 cup sauce and finish for a final 20 minutes in the pit. After the second glaze and final cooking, remove the ribs from the pit. Allow to rest for 5 minutes, and then cut into single or double bone sections and serve.'

Turn over and cook on the other side for another 2 minutes. Remove to a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Transfer the duck breasts to a cutting board and set aside to rest.Using the same pan you cooked the duck in, saute the onions, over medium heat, until golden brown. Add in the chopped apricots, apple cider vinegar, chicken stock and white wine. Cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a little cold water to create a slurry. Slowly add it to the apricot mixture, stirring constantly until the desired consistency is reached.Allow to cook until the paste taste disappears, about 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the tarragon and the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter.Slice the duck breast on a bias.

Remove from the heat, and let rest for 2 to 3 minutes, then pour into the cake pan, evenly coating the entire bottom. The caramel is extremely hot, so be careful when pouring it into the cake pan or molds.In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the condensed milk, the milk, the lime juice and zest, orange liqueur, and vanilla. Simmer for 12 to 15 minutes, stirring throughout to combine flavors.In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and yolk together, then slowly temper into the milk mixture, constantly stirring the eggs into the warmed milk. Slowly incorporating the eggs will keep the eggs from scrambling. Pour milk mixture over the caramel in cake pan. Put the cake pan into a larger shallow vessel filled halfway up with water. Put the dish into the oven and bake for 40 to 50 minutes.Remove the flan from oven and let cool. Refrigerate the flan overnight. To remove the flan from the pan, put the pan into a shallow container with about 1-inch of warm water. Let sit for about 10 minutes, which will soften the caramel and make it easier to remove.Invert the flan onto a platter and serve.'

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface, to about 1/2-inch thickness. Using a round pastry cutter or cookie cutter, about 3 inches in diameter, cut out 6 round disks.Brush each disk with the beaten egg, coating the pastry well.  Arrange on a greased baking sheet and bake until the pastry rises and is golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. When baked, remove from oven and allow to cool.Add the grapeseed oil to a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until soft and translucent (not caramelized), then add the lobster. Saute until the lobster is cooked, about 5 to 8 minutes.At this point, add the carrots and celery and saute a few more minutes until the vegetables are tender.Stir in the flour and cook for about 5 minutes; this is the beginning of the roux. Slowly begin adding the chicken stock, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens. *Add the milk, slowly and stir until incorporated to the desired thickness.Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue to cook for a further 10 to 12 minutes. Just before serving add the crabmeat and the peas and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. To serve, spoon into small bowls, sprinkle with chopped chives and top with a puff pastry disk.*Cook\\'s Note: By adding the liquid slowly it will help you see the desired thickness of the sauce. You may not need all of the milk, as some flours absorb different amounts of liquid. Just be careful."

S'For the salmon and cod cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly sprinkle the cod and salmon with salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons of the oil. Bake until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes, then cool and place in a bowl. Add one-quarter of the panko, the mayonnaise, parsley, pimentos, zest and some salt and pepper. Mix together gently to prevent the fish from breaking too much. Form two 4-ounce patties. The cakes should be moist. Gently crust the outside of the patties with the remaining panko, which will prevent the patties from sticking to the pan.Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil in a medium pan, then place the cakes in the oil and pan-fry until warmed through and the outside is nicely browned, 3 to 5 minutes.For the remoulade: Mixing together the mayonnaise, pickles, lemon juice, mustard, parsley, scallions and some salt and pepper.For the salad: In a large bowl, mix the frisee, green beans, lemon juice, apples, olive oil and some salt and pepper.Lay down the remoulade on the plate, place the fish cake on top, and then garnish with the lump crab and salad.'

S"Place the rice in a pot, with a lid and fill with 3 cups water. Stir to moisten the rice, then drain and repeat until the water runs clear. When all excess starch and impurities have been removed in this way, let the rice stand to completely drain for 15 minutes. In the meantime, wash and dry the pot to have it ready to cook the rice. Return the cleansed rice to the pot and add 2 1/3 cups water.  Cover and bring to a vigorous boil over medium-high heat. Do not remove the lid during any stage of the cooking process. Reduce heat to medium and let cook for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and let cook for 15 minutes, still leaving lid undisturbed. Remove rice from heat and let stand with lid still on pot for 5 more minutes.While the rice is cooking, make the vinegar mixture.  In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, salt, and miso over medium heat, stirring until the ingredients are integrated.  Remove from heat and set aside to cool.Separate the grains of rice with a wooden spatula and transfer to a shallow bowl, preferably wooden. Stir in enough of the vinegar to make the rice stick together in clumps when you squeeze some in the palm of your hand. Do not add too much vinegar mixture; it is better to have some left over than to over-moisten the whole batch of rice.Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and allow to cool to room temperature before using in a sushi recipe.Note: This sushi rice recipe can be used in conjunction with the recipes for the elements of the Bento Box of sushi hors d\\'oeuvres made on the episode which included: Traditional Osaka Style Sushi, Rice Balls, Maki, and Nigiri Sushi.Yield: 6 3/4 cups vinegared sushi rice for use in sushi recipes, enough for approximately 6 servings of sushi depending on the recipe"

S'Prepare the dressing for this dish. Microwave lime in a small bowl for about 30 seconds to release essential oils, and set aside until it is just cool enough to handle. Through the feed tube of a running blender add, 1 at a time, orange juice, rice wine vinegar, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the orange marmalade, to taste, (you will use the rest if, after you taste it, you decide it needs to be sweetened) and the juice from the now slightly cooled lime. With the blender still running, add the olive oil in a slow stream. Adjust flavor to your liking with additional orange marmalade, if necessary, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set the dressing aside briefly.Prepare salsa by combining pineapple, jicama, red onion, cilantro and jalapeno. Add enough dressing to coat, and reserve the rest to dress the macaroni.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni al dente. Drain well and set aside.Season the shrimp with crab boil seasoning.While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large saute pan that will be large enough to accommodate the cooked pasta. Saute scallions and garlic until tender, and then add shrimp and cook until pink and opaque, then remove to a utility platter. (Do not overcook the shrimp.) Remove the saute pan from the heat and add the cooked macaroni to the pan. Stir in Parmesan, and add enough of the remaining dressing to coat. Fold in the salsa and the shrimp, reserving a few of the shrimp for garnish. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, if needed.Transfer to serving dish and garnish with reserved shrimp and cilantro leaves. Serve any remaining dressing on the side.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.In a medium bowl, whisk together the wine, grapeseed oil, lemon juice, parsley, garlic, cilantro, cheese and curry. Add the cooked couscous and toss well.Fold and crease the parchment in half and lay the folded sheets on a flat surface. Open and divide the couscous into center of each paper, leaving 3-inch edge clean and free of couscous. Portion the raw shrimp* over the couscous, making sure that the shrimp is not stacked on top of each other, because this would prevent even cooking. In separate bowl, whisk together the ginger, grapeseed oil, lemon juice, thyme and parsley. Drizzle the sauce over the shrimp.To seal the paper, crimp the edges, in circular motion, folding each flap over half of previous fold until completely sealed. Repeat this process with each papillote. Arrange the packets on a cookie sheet and bake for 14 to 16 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Once rested, carefully remove the packets from the pan, put on serving plates and "open" the papillote with knife or scissors.'

S'Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Rub lamb loin with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil then sprinkle with Roasted Garlic Pepper. Wrap bacon around lamb loin and secure with toothpicks. Heat a skillet over high heat. Sear bacon wrapped lamb on all sides until golden brown. Remove toothpicks and strips of bacon. (Since the powerful flavor of the bacon can be overwhelming to lamb we will only use its imparted flavor from the searing process. The bacon strips can be discarded or cooked until crispy and reserved in the refrigerator for a short time to use as a garnish on a future Cobb salad or the like.) Place lamb in oven and roast until medium rare, an internal temperature of 125 degrees F. (Since the lamb will continue to cook for 5 to 8 minutes after you have removed it from the oven - carryover cooking - the meat thermometer will continue to rise to that period of time. So, the idea is to pull the lamb out at an internal temperature of 120 degrees F, so it ultimately ends up where you want it for medium rare.) Let meat rest, then cut into 1/4-inch thick slices.To make the tomato hash, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium low heat and gently cook the onion and garlic until the onion becomes translucent. Stir in the diced tomatoes and chives remove from the heat. Crumble in the cheese and allow it to melt. Place a piece of lamb on each slice of baguette, top with some of the tomato hash and mint leaves.'

S'Prepare the artichokes: Fill a saucepan with water; squeeze in the lemon juice. Add the squeezed lemon halves to the water and season with salt.Cut off and discard the top one-quarter of each artichoke with a serrated knife. Snap off the tough outer leaves. Peel the stem and base with a paring knife. Halve the artichokes lengthwise and drop into the saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover, reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the artichokes sit in the hot liquid until just tender, 5 to 10 minutes; drain.Whisk the olive oil, both vinegars, the sugar, herbs, garlic and tomato juice in a bowl. Put the artichokes and bell peppers in another bowl; drizzle with the vinegar mixture and let marinate 10 to 20 minutes.Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high. Grill the artichokes and peppers, turning, until browned, about 8 minutes. (Or, roast on a rimmed baking sheet in a 400 degrees F oven, 10 to 15 minutes.)Assemble the platter: Arrange the cheeses, cured meats, tapenade, artichokes and bell peppers on a board or platter.

S'To create the jam, in a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the red peppers, onions, 1 teaspoon salt and the white pepper. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally throughout. Next, add the sugar and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring, for 10 more minutes. Then remove from the heat and set aside.In another saucepan over low heat, warm the bechamel for 5 minutes. Then add the Brie to warm and melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Once melted, remove from the heat and keep warm.For the bread of the sandwich, heat a skillet or pan. When hot, add the butter and Texas toast, and cook until browned on each side, 2 minutes per side. Once browned, remove from the heat and set aside.To prepare the pork, preheat the oil to 350 degrees F in the deep fryer. Mix the flour with 1 teaspoon salt and the black pepper. Dredge the pork in the flour, then dip into the egg wash, then dredge in the flour again. Tap off any excess flour, then drop the pork into the fryer and cook until golden brown, 2 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the fryer and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.Preheat the broiler.In a sauce pan over medium heat, warm the chicken stock, then add the turkey and warm for 2 minutes. Remove and drain excess liquid. Stack some turkey on the toasted bread, then add two pieces cooked pork, 1 tablespoon jam, and finish with 2 tablespoons bechamel. After building the sandwich, place under the broiler until golden brown, 2 minutes. Remove from the oven. Garnish with the paprika and parsley, then serve.'

S'For the pie filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fit the pie crust into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate, place a piece of parchment paper on top and fill with pie weights or dried beans.Parbake the pie crust for 5 minutes, remove from the oven and cool.Combine the peaches, cornstarch, brown sugar, granulated sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a large bowl and toss to mix well. Transfer the peach mixture to the pie crust.For the cobbler topping: In a food processor, combine the flour, butter, baking powder, baking soda, salt and 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar, Pulse until the mixture is grainy with pea-size chunks of butter, about 30 seconds. Do not over process or the topping will become runny. Add the buttermilk and pulse 2 to 3 more times to combine.Dot the topping over the top of the pie filling. Do not make the dots too big or they will not cook through. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar over the top.Bake the pie until the edges of the crust are golden brown, the cobbler topping is cooked through and the fruit is tender, 40 to 50 minutes. If the pie crust browns before the cobbler topping is cooked through, cover the edges with foil and continue baking.'

S"To make the marinade, add soy sauce and vinegar to blender, replace lid and turn on blender. Through the feed opening add, 1 at a time, the garlic, ground cloves, thyme, black pepper, mustard and molasses. Place flank steak in a nonreactive container, add marinade and coat steak. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.While the steak is marinating, roast the garlic for the demi-glace. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut root end from end of head of garlic and use a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil to mold an enclosure around the garlic to include a base to keep it from tipping over. Pour 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil over the garlic from the root end so the oil flows between the papery skins and the cloves, reserving the rest of the oil for sauteing the shallots. Roast for 40 minutes to 1 hour, being sure to monitor so the garlic doesn\\'t burn. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature.To make yuca, boil until tender in enough water to cover. Drain well, rinse and set aside briefly. Make a dressing by adding vinegar, salt and thyme to a blender and adding the olive oil in a slow thin stream through the feed opening with the blender running.  Mix yuca with enough dressing to coat and refrigerate. Heat grill (or use grill pan). Remove steak from marinade, discard marinade, and sear each side of steak. Cook to your desired level of doneness and transfer to a cutting board to let rest for 5 minutes.To complete the demi-glace, heat the remaining tablespoon of grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and saute until translucent. Deglaze pan with wine and allow most of it to evaporate. In a small bowl, whisk together water and beef base and add to pan. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves directly from their skins into a small bowl and mash them. Add the roasted garlic to the pan and stir until it is integrated with the rest of the contents of the pan. Allow to reduce by half. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, remove from heat and keep warm.Slice steak on the bias into 1/4-inch thick strips and arrange on plate alongside yuca. Spoon sauce over steak. Garnish with minced parsley."

S'Boil sweet potatoes until tender and drain. Add molasses, honey, vanilla, brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mash by hand then beat until smooth with an electric beater. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Pour the cream into a saucepan and add the vanilla bean seeds,  and the pods. Over medium low heat slowly bring to a boil, then remove from heat, cover pan and set aside for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar whipping until you see a change in color.  After 15 minutes remove the vanilla pods from the cream mixture. Then slowly incorporate the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture a little at a time, whisking constantly as you go.Lightly grease 6 to 8 (4 or 6-ounce) ramekins. Add even amounts of the sweet potato mixture to the ramekins. Then fill the ramekins each 3/4 full with the custard mixture.Place the filled ramekins in a roasting pan and prepare a bain marie by adding hot water to the pan so that the water level is halfway up the side of the ramekins. Be careful to avoid splashing any water into the ramekins. Bake in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, allow to cool and then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. (You can do this way in advance if you wish.) Just before serving remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm up a little. Then divide the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar among the ramekins sprinkling some on the surface of each cup. Using a blow torch, melt the sugar to form a crispy sugar "crust" on the top of each. This custard could be served with fruits of the season.'

Do not boil.For the caramel: Mix together 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Heat until the sugar dissolves and continue cooking until the sugar turns golden brown. Do not stir. Remove from heat and add 2 tablespoons of orange juice. (Be very careful when you add this because the hot sugar will fly everywhere.) Shake the pan to incorporate the orange juice and sugar. Spray 8 (4 to 5-ounce) ramekin dishes or 1 large flan mold, with cooking spray.  Pour the caramel into the dishes, to completely cover the bottom. In a large bowl mix together the remaining 2/3 cup sugar, the eggs, and a pinch of salt and whisk well. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk and gradually blend the milk into egg and sugar mixture while stirring or whisking constantly. Stir in the heavy cream, then strain the egg mixture through a sieve.At this point, add the vanilla bean seeds and pour the mixture into the ramekin dishes over the caramel. Fill a deep casserole dish with water and arrange ramekins in the casserole dish. The water should reach halfway up the dishes.  Bake in the preheated 200 degrees F oven until the custard sets, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the ramekins from the oven and cool. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before serving. To serve: Mix together fresh berries and raspberry sauce in a small bowl. Remove the ramekins from the refrigerator and loosen the edges with a small knife.  Put a dessert plate on top of the ramekin dish, and turn upside down, so that the caramel sits on top.  Remove ramekin dish. Spoon the berries on top of each creme caramel and garnish with a fresh mint sprig.'

S"Slice fish across the grain into thin (1/4-inch thick) pieces about 2inches long by 1-inch wide.  Lay out the seaweed and have the cornstarch slurry ready. Place a slice of fish across the fingers of your left hand just above the palm (if you are right handed), dab 1/16th teaspoon wasabi on the fish and add 2 tablespoons rice on top of the fish. Squeeze and form the sushi. Place the sushi, rice side down on top of a band of nori. Using your fingers moisten the tips of the nori with some of the cornstarch mixture and fold the band of nori upon itself to adhere. Keep sushi cold until serving.Note: This recipe can be used in conjunction with the other recipes for the elements of the Bento Box of sushi hors d\\'oeuvres made on the episode which also included: Traditional Osaka Style Sushi, Rice Balls, and Maki.

S"Bring 2 pots of water to aboil, 1 each for the pasta and potatoes. For the Chicken: Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer, then set up a breading station. Whisk together 3 eggs and a cup of the half-and-half for the egg wash. (Begin with this amount and whisk more together if needed.) Combine flour and huckleberry seasoning. Set up a bowl, each of: flour mixture, egg wash, and bread crumbs. Evenly coat chicken with flour (not too much or bread crumbs won\\'t stick). Dip floured chicken into egg wash, then into bread crumbs. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a deep-fat fryer, lightly fry chicken until golden brown. Finish in the oven until completely cooked, at least 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest.For the Macaroni and Cheese: While the chicken is cooking, boil the pasta until al dente and drain well so that you don\\'t have excess cooking water which will dilute the flavor. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and cook until translucent. Gradually add the flour to make a roux. Cook roux 5 minutes, until light golden in color.  Incorporate enough of the chicken broth a little at a time to form a smooth sauce. Simmer for at least 10 minutes to allow the flour to cook out. Add the heavy cream and Cheddar and then season with salt and white pepper. Then fold in as much pasta as you need to acquire the right consistency for macaroni and cheese. Cover and set aside in a warm place. For the Mashed Potatoes: Boil the potatoes until tender and drain well. Then mash the potatoes and stir in cubed butter. Whip milk, salt and pepper into the potatoes with a beater.To Plate: Form a bed of mashed potatoes make a well in the center. Spoon enough macaroni and cheese into the well until so that it just begins to breach the edges of the well. Spoon some of the quince jelly in the center of the mound of macaroni and cheese. Place a chicken breast on top of the macaroni and cheese, and garnish with fresh chopped chives."
