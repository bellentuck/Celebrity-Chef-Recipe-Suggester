S'Blending Hot Liquids: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid; that prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times, then process on high speed until smooth.'

S'In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sherry, cornstarch, brown sugar and ginger. Add the beef to a separate bowl and pour one-third of the liquid over the top. Save the rest of the liquid. Toss the beef and set aside.Heat the oil in a heavy skillet (iron is best) over high heat. Add the snow peas and stir for 45 seconds and get as much color on them as possible. Remove to a plate.Allow the skillet to get very hot again. With tongs, add half the meat mixture, leaving most of the marinade still in the bowl. Spread out the meat as you add it to skillet, but do not stir for a good minute. (You want the meat to get as brown as possible in as short amount a time as possible.) Sprinkle half the scallions over the meat. Flip the meat to the other side and cook for another 30 seconds. Remove to a clean plate.Repeat with the other half of the meat, allowing the skillet to get very hot again first. After flipping, add the first plateful of meat, the reserved liquid, the crushed red pepper and snow peas. Stir over high heat for 30 seconds, and then turn off the heat. Check seasonings and add salt only if it needs it. The mixture will thicken as it sits. Serve immediately over rice.'

Place them on a plate. Continue coating the chicken strips until they are all ready to cook.When the oil is sufficiently heated, begin cooking the strips a few at a time. Cook them for about a minute and a half or so on each side. When golden and crispy and the chicken is done, remove them to a paper-towel-lined plate.

Line a baking sheet with a baking mat or parchment paper.In a large bowl, combine the flour, ground oats, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir to combine. Add the butter pieces and use a pastry cutter to work the butter and dry ingredients together until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the chopped pecans.Whisk together the cream, maple extract and egg in a small bowl. Pour into the flour mixture, stirring gently until it all comes together. (The mixture will not come together in one cohesive ball; it should be in a few large clumps with some crumbs in the bowl.) If it is overly crumbly and will not come together at all, add a couple of tablespoons of extra cream and work it in.Turn the dough out onto a cutting board or floured surface and use your hands to press it into a 6- to 8-inch circle about 3/4 inch thick. Cut into 8 equal wedges (or you can cut into smaller wedges to get more).Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and bake until poufy and set and just barely golden, 20 to 24 minutes. (They shouldn\\'t have much color on them at all.) Allow to cool completely.For the icing: Combine the powdered sugar, milk, butter, coffee and maple extract in a large bowl. Make sure the icing\\'s thick but still pourable.Drizzle a very generous amount of the icing onto each scone, then sprinkle on a few more chopped pecans. Allow the icing to set completely, then serve.The scones will keep nice and fresh for days in a plastic zipper bag."

S"Begin by peeling the onions and slicing very thinly, use a mandoline slicer if you can. Separate the onion slices and place them in a shallow baking dish and pour the buttermilk over the top. Press the onions down so they\\'re submerged as much as possible and let them soak on the counter for at least an hour. If necessary, stir them around a bit halfway through the soaking process.In a bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper and cayenne, and set aside.Pour 1 to 2 quarts canola oil in a pot or Dutch oven. Heat to 375 degrees F, or until a pinch of flour sizzles when sprinkled over the pot.Using tongs, remove a handful of onions from the buttermilk and immediately dunk into the flour mixture. Coat the onions in the flour mixture, and then tap them on the inside of the bowl to shake off the excess.Plunge the onions in the hot oil. With a spoon, fiddle with them a bit just to break them up, and watch them! They\\'ll be ready to remove from the oil in no time flat.When they\\'re golden brown (this should take just a minute or two), remove them from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate.Repeat with the remaining onion slices and serve immediately.Pile these on top of a juicy grilled hamburger - to die for!"

S"For the marinade: In a blender, combine the olive oil, chili powder, Worcestershire, cumin, red pepper flakes, garlic and lime juice. Next add the sugar, salt and pepper and blend the marinade until it\\'s totally combined and smooth.For the meat: Place the chicken and beef in separate 2-quart baking dishes or large resealable plastic storage bags. Pour the marinade over the chicken and beef and rub the marinade all over the meat. Give your hands a good wash, and then cover the dishes with plastic wrap and let them marinate in the fridge for 4 to 6 hours.For the pico de gallo: Chop the tomatoes, jalapenos and onion into a very small dice. (Leave the seeds in your jalapenos for a hotter pico. Adjust the amount of jalapenos to your preferred temperature.) Next, chop up a nice-sized bunch of cilantro. Just remove and discard the long leafless stems before chopping. No need to remove the leaves from the stems completely. Place all of these ingredients together in a bowl and give it a good stir. Squeeze the juice of half a lime into the bowl. Add salt to taste and stir again.For the fajita vegetables: Throw the onions and bell peppers into a bowl and toss with the olive oil and some salt and pepper.When ready to cook, preheat the grill to high heat.Cook the chicken on both sides until completely cooked through (or to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F), about 4 minutes per side. Remove it to a platter to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.Grill the beef on both sides until completely cooked through, about 5 minutes in total. Remove it to a platter to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.Tip the fajita vegetables into a grill basket and grill until cooked, tossing occasionally, about 10 minutes.To put it all together: Pile the veggies on a platter. Slice the chicken and beef.For the fixins: Wrap the tortillas in foil and warm through on the grill. Serve the chicken, beef and veggies with the warm tortillas, Fiesta Beans, grated cheese, sour cream, lime wedges and pico de gallo."

S"Thoroughly rinse the chicken, then cover all the pieces with 4 cups buttermilk and soak in the fridge overnight or up to 24 hours. When you\\'re ready to fry the chicken, remove the bowl from the fridge and let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes, just to take off the chill.In the meantime, preheat the oven to 360 degrees F and mix up the breading. Place the flour, seasoned salt, paprika, pepper, thyme and cayenne (extra cayenne if you like heat) in a very large bowl. Stir together well.In a small bowl, combine the 1/4 cup buttermilk and the milk. Pour the milk mixture into the flour and, with a fork, gradually mix until there are little lumps throughout. This will adhere to the chicken and make for a crispier breading. If necessary, add a little more flour or milk to the bowl in order to make it slightly lumpy.Heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until a thermometer reaches 365 degrees F. Lower the heat slightly, if necessary, to keep the oil from getting hotter.Working in batches, thoroughly coat each chicken piece with the breading, pressing extra breading onto the chicken if necessary. Place the breaded pieces on a plate.Add the chicken to the oil 3 or 4 pieces at a time. Make sure they aren\\'t sticking together, then cover the pan and fry for 5 to 7 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the chicken isn\\'t getting too brown. Turn the pieces over, cover again, and cook 3 to 5 minutes more. All the while, monitor the temperature of the oil to make sure the chicken doesn\\'t burn.Place the chicken on a baking sheet and continue frying the rest of the chicken. When all the chicken has been fried, remove the wings and legs to a plate and keep covered. These should be cooked all the way through by now but always check, if any pink juice or meat is visible. If so, return to the hot oil for another minute or so until fully cooked. Leave the thighs and breasts on the baking sheet.Bake the thighs and breasts for 15 minutes to finish the cooking process. Sometimes I\\'ll cut into the thicker part of one of the larger pieces, just to make sure the chicken is cooked through. If any pink juice or meat is visible, the chicken needs to continue cooking in the oven."

S"For the doughnuts: Add the granulated sugar to the warm milk in a medium bowl, and then add the yeast. Allow it to sit until the yeast starts to bubble, 5 to 10 minutes.In a small bowl, beat the eggs and then pour them into a bowl with the melted butter, whisking constantly. Add the butter/egg mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer. Pour in the milk/sugar/yeast mixture. With the hook attachment, turn the mixer to low speed.Mix the flour and salt in a bowl, and then retrieve 1/2 cup at a time and add it to the mixing bowl, allowing it to slowly incorporate into the liquid mixture.Continue mixing for 5 minutes after the flour is combined. Stop the mixer, scrape the bowl and then mix about 30 seconds more. Then place the dough in a lightly-oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 to 12 hours.The next morning, remove the dough from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature and rise, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Put the dough in a warm spot, if necessary, to facilitate rising.Turn out the dough on to a floured surface and roll it out to about 1/4-inch thick. Use a doughnut cutter (or 2 concentric cutters) to cut out the doughnuts. Remove the holes and transfer the doughnuts to a lightly-floured baking sheet lined with a baking mat or parchment. Then - and this is the vital part - cover the doughnuts lightly with tea towels and place it in a draft-free area, at least 1 1/2 to 2 hours. It will take that long for them to rise. If they don\\'t seem to be rising much, move the pan to a warm place.Melt the shortening in a pot over a medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer. (Or you can drop one of the doughnut holes in the oil, if it sizzles and immediately rises to the surface, the oil is ready.) The doughnuts should immediately float to the top and puff up. Then use a metal spoon or spatula to carefully flip them over to the other side. Remove them from the oil as soon as they\\'re golden brown on both sides (this should take less than 1 minute in total). At the end, drop in the doughnut holes and fry them until they are golden brown.Place the doughnuts on paper-towel-lined-plates to drain. Don\\'t worry if they\\'re a little imperfect; if your fingers leave impressions when you dropped them into the oil, that just means they were extra light and fluffy.For the glaze: To glaze the doughnuts, mix the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup cold water, salt and vanilla in a bowl until smooth. Drop in the doughnuts one at a time. Quickly turn them over then remove them. Place them on a rack so any excess glaze can drip off.To make the most of the glaze, set the holes underneath the doughnuts so they can catch the extra good stuff."

Swirl to coat the skillet, and then add half of the cut-up chicken pieces, spreading them out as you put them in. NOTE: Do not begin stirring the chicken immediately as you want to get them nice and brown. After a minute or two, flip over the chicken with a spatula and let brown on the other side. Remove to a plate and set aside. Repeat with the second half of the chicken pieces.Add a tablespoon or so of olive oil, if needed, into the hot skillet and throw in the garlic and chopped onions and give them a stir. Now add the chicken broth (or wine), whisking to deglaze the bottom of the skillet. Cook until the liquid reduces by half. Add the crushed tomatoes and stir to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste and a pinch of sugar. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.Add the chicken (and don\\'t forget all of those yummy chicken juices on the plate) to the tomato/onion mixture and continue simmering for another 15 minutes. Toward the end of the cooking process, chop up your fresh basil and add it to the sauce, stirring to combine.Put the pasta on a platter or in a large bowl and smother with the sauce.

S"Make the salsa: Combine the whole tomatoes with their juices, diced tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic, jalapeno, sugar, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the lime juice in a food processor or blender. Pulse several times until it reaches the consistency you like. Set aside.Prepare the pizza: Place the oven rack in the lowest position and preheat to 475 degrees F. Fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until chewy, about 8 minutes; drain on paper towels. Chop into bite-size pieces.Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a separate large skillet over medium-high heat; add the frozen hash browns and cook, stirring occasionally, until they just start turning golden brown, about 7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. In the same skillet, fry the red and green peppers in the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high heat until they\\'re nice and brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside.Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Spread 1/2 cup salsa over the dough, then evenly distribute the sliced mozzarella over the salsa. Sprinkle with the hash browns, bell peppers and bacon.Next comes the fun part! Make 8 little wells in the filling here and there all over the surface of the pizza; crack the eggs into the wells. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the eggs are set but still slightly soft, about 15 minutes. Cut into large pieces and serve with the remaining salsa.Photograph by Steve Giralt"

S"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 9- by 13-inch cake pan.Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl.Separate the eggs. Beat the egg yolks with 3/4 cup of the sugar on high speed until the yolks are pale yellow. Stir in the milk and vanilla. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir very gently until combined.Beat the egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. With the mixer on, pour in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Fold the egg white mixture into the batter very gently until just combined. Spoon into the prepared pan and spread to even out the surface.Bake until the cake is done, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan, and then turn out (upside down) onto a rimmed platter.For the tres leches: Combine the heavy cream, evaporated milk and condensed milk in a small pitcher. Pierce the surface of the cake with a fork several times. Drizzle the milk mixture over the top and allow the cake to sit and absorb the milk mixture. Don\\'t worry about totally soaking the cake! That\\'s what you want.For the icing: Whip the cream with the sugar. Spread it evenly over the top and sides of the soaked cake and decorate with maraschino cherries.Refrigerate until ready to serve. Several hours is fine. The cooler the cake, the better!"

Sprinkle the flour over the onions and whisk them together. Continue cooking the onion/flour mixture until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the half-and-half and milk and whisk around, allowing the mixture to thicken; this will take 3 to 4 minutes. Add some pepper, stir the sauce, reduce the heat and keep warm.Slice the potatoes really thin using a mandolin or a really sharp knife, the thinner the better. Generously butter a 2-quart baking dish, then add half the sliced potatoes and half the diced ham. Sprinkle on half the cheese then pour on half the sauce from the skillet. Repeat with the rest of the ingredients, ending with a layer of cheese and sauce. Sprinkle extra pepper on top.Cover the dish with foil and bake it for 40 minutes, then remove the foil and bake until the cheese is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, an additional 20 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley if desired and serve it up.'

S"Snap the stem ends of the green beans, or cut them off in a big bunch with a knife if you\\'d prefer.Melt the bacon grease in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook for a minute. Then add the green beans and cook until the beans turn bright green, about a minute. Add the chicken broth, chopped red pepper, salt and pepper to taste. Turn the heat to low and cover the skillet with a lid, leaving the lid cracked to allow steam to escape. Cook until the liquid evaporates and the beans are fairly soft, yet still a bit crisp, 20 to 30 minutes. You can add more chicken broth during the cooking process, but don\\'t be afraid to let it all cook away so the onions and peppers can start to caramelize."

S"Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.Heat the olive oil in a heavy ovenproof pot (with a lid) over high heat. Salt and pepper both sides of the roast, then sear it for about a minute on one side and a minute on the other side. Remove the meat to a plate.Reduce the heat to medium high and add the tomato paste, celery, garlic and onions. Stir it around and cook until the vegetables start to soften and the tomato paste releases its flavor, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the glorious wine, then stir and scrape the pot to get up all the browned bits on the bottom. Pour in the broth, then stir in the marmalade.Return the meat to the pot and top it all off with the potatoes, carrots, parsnips, rosemary and thyme. Push the veggies and herbs into the liquid, then put the lid on the pot, transfer to the oven and roast until the meat is fork-tender, 3 to 4 hours. (Mmmm. The liquid becomes something magical.)Transfer the roast to a serving dish (if it falls apart that\\'s a good sign!) and place the vegetables all around it, then spoon on as much sauce from the pot as you\\'d like.

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the meatloaf: Pour the milk over the bread and allow it to soak in for several minutes. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, parsley, Italian seasoning, salt, seasoned salt and some pepper in a large mixing bowl. Add the eggs. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined.Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a foil-lined broiler pan, which will allow the fat from the meat to drain. Lay the pancetta slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf to give the meatloaf some support.For the tomato sauce: Put the diced tomatoes into a bowl. Add the brown sugar, dry mustard and cayenne pepper and splash in the Worcestershire sauce. Stir the mixture until well combined. Pour one-third of the sauce over the top of the meatloaf.Bake for 45 minutes, and then pour another third of the remaining tomato sauce over the meatloaf. Bake until no longer pink in the middle, for an additional 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to sit 10 minutes before serving.Serve with the remaining tomato sauce on the side as a dipping sauce.'

Cover tightly with foil. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours.When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Cook the brisket in the foil-covered pan until fork-tender, about 40 minutes per pound (6 to 7 hours). Transfer to a cutting board, slice against the grain and put the slices back into the cooking liquid. Serve immediately, spooning the juice over the slices. (Barbecue sauce may be used, if preferred.)You may store the pan in the fridge for up to 2 days, or freeze for use at a later date. If fat collects and hardens at the top, remove and discard.Brisket is great with mashed potatoes, with the juice spooned over the top. It is also great on a sandwich with melted cheese.'

Set the warmed tortillas aside.In a bowl, mix together the cumin, chili powder, Cajun spice, salt and pepper. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken breasts with the spice mix.Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook the chicken on both sides until done in the middle and the juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Set aside on a plate to cool, then shred finely with a fork.Throw the onions into the same skillet, stir them around and cook until deep golden brown and caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes; set them aside on a plate. Pour the enchilada sauce into the skillet and reduce the heat to low, allowing it to warm through.To assemble the enchiladas: Pour 2 cups of the sauce into a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish and leave the rest in the skillet. Dip a tortilla into the sauce in the skillet, then lay it on a baking sheet or plate. Sprinkle some cheese down the middle, followed by some chicken and finally, some of the caramelized onions. Roll it up tightly, then place it seam-side down in the casserole dish. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas. Pour the rest of the sauce over the enchiladas, then sprinkle on the rest of the cheese. Give it a final sprinkling of chili powder.Bake until hot and bubbly, 30 minutes. Let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.Serve the enchiladas topped with a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of diced tomatoes, a sprinkling of cilantro and a wedge of lime.'

S'For the scones: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Split the vanilla beans in half lengthwise and scrape out all the vanilla "caviar" inside. Stir the caviar into the cream. Set aside for 15 minutes.Sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut the cold butter into pats, and then use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the butter into the flour. Keep going until the mixture resembles crumbs.Mix the vanilla cream with the egg, and then combine with the flour mixture. Stir gently with a fork just until it comes together.Turn the dough onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle. (Mixture will be pretty crumbly.) Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 12-by-7 inches and 1/2-to-3/4-inches thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. Then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical squares/rectangles. Next, cut each square/rectangle in half diagonally, to form two triangles. Transfer to a parchment or baking-mat-lined cookie sheet and bake for 18 minutes, removing from the oven just before they start to turn golden. Allow to cool for 15 minutes on the cookie sheet, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.For the glaze: Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape out the caviar. Stir the caviar into the milk. Set aside for 15 minutes.Mix the powdered sugar and salt with the vanilla milk, adding more powdered sugar or milk if necessary to get the right consistency. Stir or whisk until completely smooth.One at a time, carefully dunk each cooled scone in the glaze, turning it over if necessary. Transfer to parchment paper or the cooling rack. Allow the glaze to set completely, about an hour. Scones will keep several days if glazed.'

Sear both rib eye halves until a nice dark golden color, 2 to 3 minutes per side.Place the peppercorns into a bag and crush with a rolling pin. Shred the leaves from the thyme and rosemary sprigs. Mix the salt with the crushed peppercorns, rosemary leaves, thyme leaves and garlic. Pour olive oil over the rib eye and pour on the rub mix. Pat slightly to get it to stick to the meat. Roast for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 275 degrees F and roast until a meat thermometer registers 125 for rare/medium-rare, about 20 more minutes (the roast will continue to cook slightly after removing from the oven). Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.'

Crumble in the sausage, add the crushed red pepper and cook for a couple of minutes. Add the marinara sauce, mix everything together and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.  Set aside to cool.To assemble, add about 2 spoonfuls of the sauce--just enough to coat the bottom--to a baking dish. Then layer half of the cooled noodles, half of the mozzarella cubes and half of the remaining sauce. Repeat the process: layer the remaining noodles, mozzarella and sauce, then top with the Parmesan. Cover and put in the fridge or freezer until ready to cook.When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cook the rigatoni until heated through and bubbling, 25 minutes straight from the fridge, or 2 hours straight from the freezer. Garnish with minced parsley before serving.'

S'First, whip up the pie crust: Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the vegetable shortening and salted butter. Work the butter into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles.Add the egg, 5 tablespoons cold water and the white vinegar. Stir until just combined. Divide the dough in half and chill until needed. (You will only need one half for this recipe, reserve the other half for another use.)Next make the filling: Mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, butter, vanilla and eggs together in a bowl.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out one dough half on a lightly floured surface to fit your pie pan. Pour the pecans in the bottom of the unbaked pie shell. Pour the syrup mixture over the top. Cover the top and crust lightly/gently with foil.Bake the pie for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, and then continue baking for 20 minutes, being careful not to burn the crust or pecans. The pie should not be overly jiggly when you remove it from the oven (though it will jiggle a bit). If it shakes a lot, cover with foil and bake for an additional 20 minute or until set. Required baking time seems to vary widely with this recipe. Sometimes it takes 50 minutes, sometimes it takes 75!Allow to cool for several hours or overnight. Serve in thin slivers.'

Transfer it to the pan and lightly press it to cover all the ingredients.Bake until the batter is fully baked, 22 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool completely, then place the pan in the fridge, covered in foil, for a couple of hours.Remove the brownies from the pan in one piece, then sprinkle on plenty of powdered sugar.

Turn off the heat just before the grits are done.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs. To temper the eggs before adding them to the hot grits, throw a couple of spoonfuls of the hot grits into the eggs. Begin stirring immediately and continue stirring until the mixture is well combined.Pour the egg mixture into the grits. Stir constantly to incorporate the eggs into the grits. Add the butter and stir until melted. Next, add the cheese and stir until melted. Add the cayenne and garlic and stir well to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt or cayenne if necessary. You could also add more cheese if you think that will bring happiness to your life, but keep in mind that some cheeses increase the salt content more than others.Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and pour the grits into the dish. Bake until the grits are hot and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. The grits will become firmer as they cool.'

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a bowl, toss the oats with the canola oil, melted butter and salt. Spread the mixture out on 2 baking sheets and toast in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, shaking the pan twice and making sure they don\\'t burn. Remove from the oven and set aside. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F.In a medium saucepan, combine the brown sugar, honey, apple juice and molasses. Heat the mixture slowly, stirring until all combined. Stir in the vanilla and remove from the heat.Toss together the toasted oats, rice cereal, wheat germ, pecans and almonds. Pour in the sugar mixture, stirring as you pour. Toss to combine; it will be sticky.Press into 1 baking sheet (thoroughly greased with butter) and bake until golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. Cut pieces with a sharp knife and remove from the pan. You can cut them while they\\'re still warm if that\\'s easier.Dip the cooled granola bars straight into the melted chocolate so that the top is plain and the bottom is chocolate-covered. Set on parchment until set, sticking in the fridge to hasten this along if necessary."

S'Add the wild rice to a medium saucepan with 5 cups of the chicken broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook until the rice has just started to break open and is slightly tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Set aside.Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil and prepare an ice water bath. Blanch the broccoli by throwing the florets into the boiling water until bright green and still slightly crisp, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Immediately drain the broccoli and plunge it into the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove it from the ice water and set aside.Heat a large pot over medium-high heat, then melt 6 tablespoons of the butter. Add the mushrooms and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid begins to evaporate, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the carrots and celery and cook until the vegetables are soft and the mixture begins to turn darker in color, 3 to 4 minutes.Sprinkle the flour on the vegetables, stir to incorporate it and cook for about a minute. Pour in the remaining 3 cups of broth and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and allow it to thicken, about 3 minutes. Pour in the heavy cream, stirring to combine. Let the mixture cook until it thickens. Add the salt and pepper, then taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Mix together the cooked rice and broccoli and tip into a 2-quart baking dish. Using a ladle, scoop out the vegetable/broth mixture and spoon it evenly all over the top, totally covering the surface with the vegetables.Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, then pour it into a separate bowl with the panko breadcrumbs. Toss the mixture together to coat the breadcrumbs in butter, then sprinkle the breadcrumbs all over the top of the casserole.Cover with foil and bake the casserole for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until golden brown on top, another 15 minutes. Sprinkle on the parsley after you remove it from the oven.'

S'For the strawberry shortcake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8-inch cake pan.Sift together the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter with 1 1/2 cups of the granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the sour cream and vanilla, and mix until combined. Add the sifted dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just barely combined.Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake until no longer jiggly like my bottom, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the cake from the pan as soon as you pull it out of the oven. Place the cake on a cooling rack and allow it to cool completely.Stem and halve the strawberries, and mash then them. Sprinkle the strawberries with the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and allow to sit for 30 minutes.For the icing: Combine the powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter, vanilla and dash of salt in a mixing bowl. Mix until very light and fluffy.Slice the cake in half to make 2 smaller cakes. Spread the strawberries evenly over each cut side of the cake halves, pouring on all the juices as well. Place the cake halves into the freezer for 5 minutes, just to make icing the cake easier.Remove the cake halves from the freezer. Use a little less than one-third of the icing to spread over the top of the strawberries on the bottom layer. Place the second layer of cake on top. Add half of the remaining icing to the top spreading evenly, then spread the remaining icing around the sides.Leave plain or garnish with strawberry halves. Serve slightly cool.'

S"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.For the chive pie crust: Mix the flour, chives and salt in a bowl. Add the butter and vegetable shortening and work them into the flour using a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. Using a fork, stir in the vinegar, beaten egg and 5 tablespoons cold water. Stir the mixture until just combined. Shape the dough into 2 discs. (You\\'ll only be using 1 disc for this recipe. You can wrap the additional dough in plastic wrap for storage; it will keep up to a week in the fridge or up to 6 months in the freezer.)Have ready 2 sheets of parchment paper that are each at least 12 inches square. Place the disc of dough between them. (If the dough is sticky for any reason, don\\'t worry. Just sprinkle some flour on the parchment to get started. You shouldn\\'t have to add much for it to stop sticking.) Starting at the center, roll the pin out to the edge. Turn the dough and parchment as necessary and continue rolling, always from the center to the outer edge. After a couple of rolls, lift the parchment paper away from the dough to loosen and replace the parchment. Flip the whole thing and loosen the other paper sheet. Continue rolling until the dough is large enough for your pie pan.For the filling: Slice the leeks thinly, and then soak them in cold water for about 10 minutes to remove any grit or dirt. Drain well.Put the mushrooms on a large baking sheet. Roast until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, saute the leeks in the butter until golden brown and beginning to caramelize, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside.For the quiche base, add the cream and eggs to a medium bowl and whisk them to combine. Stir in the leeks, mushrooms, grated Swiss and some salt and pepper. Mix in the pesto and prosciutto. The mixture should be very thick!Pour the mixture into the pie shell, then cover loosely with a sheet of aluminum foil to prevent it from getting too brown on top. Bake for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the quiche to sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.Place the quiche on a cutting board and slice wedges with a serrated knife. Delicious for breakfast, and even better for lunch with a salad and a bunch of juicy grapes!From Food Network Kitchen: This recipe has been updated and may differ from what was originally published or broadcast."

S'For the blueberry syrup: Put the blueberries, sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce the heat and simmer until thick, 20 to 25 minutes.Strain the blueberries through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing to get all the liquid out, then place the liquid in the fridge and chill until cold (or place the pan in a bowl of ice to chill down fast).For the lemonade: Mix the sugar with 6 cups of tap water and stir until the sugar is dissolved to make a simple syrup.Pour the lemon juice into a large vat. Pour in three-quarters of the simple syrup and 8 cups of water (give or take). Add the blueberry syrup, stir it around and then give it a taste. Add more simple syrup if it needs sweetness, or more water if it needs dilution. Top up with lots of ice before serving.'

S'Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain when the pasta is still al dente; do not overcook!Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun spice (or more) over the chicken cubes. Toss around to coat. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. Add half the chicken in a single layer; do not stir. Allow the chicken to brown on one side, about 1 minute. Flip to the other side and cook an additional minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a clean plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Remove the chicken, leaving the skillet on high heat. Add the remaining butter and olive oil. When heated, add the garlic, peppers and onions. Sprinkle on the remaining Cajun spice, and add salt if needed. Cook over high heat for 1 minute, stirring gently and trying to get the vegetables as dark/black as possible. Add the tomatoes and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Remove all the vegetables from the skillet.With the skillet still over high heat, pour in the chicken broth and wine. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Reduce the heat to medium-low and pour in the cream, stirring/whisking constantly. Cook the sauce over medium-low heat for a few minutes, until the cream starts to thicken the mixture. Taste and add freshly ground black pepper, cayenne pepper, and/or salt to taste. The sauce should be spicy!Finally, add the chicken and vegetables to the sauce, making sure to include all the juices that have drained onto the plate. Stir and cook until the mixture is bubbly and hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the drained fettuccine and toss to combine.Top with chopped fresh parsley and chow down!'

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make the cake batter: Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, granulated sugar, 1/2 stick butter, the shortening, milk, eggs, vanilla and 2 tablespoons pineapple juice in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium speed until well combined. (There will still be a few small lumps in the batter.) Set aside.Melt the remaining 1/2 stick butter in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat; swirl to thoroughly coat the skillet. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the butter, making sure it\\'s evenly distributed-you want the entire surface of the butter to be covered in brown sugar. Do not stir. As soon as the sugar dissolves, remove from the heat and layer the pineapple slices over the top. If desired, place maraschino cherries in the centers of the pineapple slices.Pour the batter evenly over the pineapple slices and gently spread to even out the top. Bake the cake 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Immediately run a knife around the edge of the cake, then put a plate upside down on top of the skillet. Carefully invert the skillet so the cake is turned onto the plate. It should come out pretty easily; if bits of cake stick to the skillet, use a small knife to patch it together. Let cool slightly before cutting into wedges. It\\'s best served warm.Photograph by Yunhee Kim"

Continue until all the meat is breaded.Heat the butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Fry the steak strips 4 or 5 at a time, turning midway through. When golden brown, remove from the skillet to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue with the remaining meat. Cover loosely with foil to keep warm.For the gravy: Pour off all the grease from the skillet, and then add 1/4 cup of the grease back in. Sprinkle on the flour. Whisk the mixture till it becomes a paste (add more flour if you need to) and cook the paste over medium-low heat until it\\'s deep golden brown. Pour in about 3 cups of the milk, whisking constantly. Allow the gravy to cook and thicken, whisking regularly and adding more milk if it seems too thick right off the bat. Season the gravy with salt and pepper and pour into small dishes.Serve the steak fingers with the gravy. Yum!"

S'Add 1 stick of the butter to a medium skillet over medium heat. Allow it to melt and bubble up for 3 to 4 minutes, swirling the skillet to keep the butter moving around. When the butter is a medium golden brown, remove from the heat (it will continue browning in the skillet over the next 30 seconds or so!). Pour the butter (and any solids in the bottom) into a heatproof bowl and allow it to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, allow the other stick of butter to soften.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream the softened stick of butter together with the brown sugar and granulated sugar until its nice and combined. Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until smooth, scraping the bowl if necessary to make sure everything is incorporated. With the mixer on medium low, very slowly drizzle in the cooled melted butter, making sure to add all the darker brown solids. Scrape the bowl and mix again until everything is combined, 20 to 30 seconds.In a separate bowl, combine the flour, coffee granules, baking soda and salt. Stir together, then add it to the butter mixture in 3 increments, mixing on low after each until its totally incorporated. Scrape the bowl and beat for a few more seconds. Stir in the chocolate chunks and the pecans if using.In batches, scoop the cookie dough by heaping teaspoons onto the prepared baking sheet. Press extra chocolate chunks into the tops of each cookie if desired. Refrigerate the scooped cookies for 15 minutes, then bake until golden brown, 9 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, then transfer the cookies to a cooling rack. Repeat with the rest of the dough.Serve!'

If you think they\\'re thin enoughpound \\'em a few more times! The thinner the better.In a dish, whisk together the milk and eggs. Place the flour in another dish and mix in some salt and pepper. Place the breadcrumbs in a third dish. Set the 3 dishes aside for a sec.Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken pieces, then dredge them 1 at a time in the flour, then quickly dunk both sides in the egg mixture and then coat both sides in the breadcrumbs. Lay each piece on a plate until you\\'re ready to cook them.Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. When it\\'s melted and hot, add 2 pieces of the breaded chicken and cook, flipping once, until the breading is golden brown and the chicken is cooked, 2 to 3 minutes per side; transfer the chicken to a clean plate. Add the other tablespoon of butter and oil to the skillet and cook the other 2 pieces of chicken.To serve, place 1 piece of cooked chicken on each plate. Top generously with arugula. Sprinkle with a little kosher salt, drizzle with balsamic vinegar and sprinkle on some Parmesan shavings. Serve with a lemon wedge on the side."

S'For the soup:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice the onions in half from root to tip, then slice them thin.Melt the butter in a heavy ovenproof pot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the onions, stir to coat them in the butter and cook, covered, until translucent and soft, about 20 minutes.Transfer the pot to the oven with the lid slightly ajar. Roast the onions for 1 hour, stirring twice to keep them from burning. (Some brown bits on the bottom of the pan are fine though.)Return the pot to the stovetop over medium heat (keep the oven on) and pour in the wine. Stir, scraping the pan. Cook until the wine reduces, 5 minutes. Next, add the beef broth, chicken broth, thyme, Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Reduce the heat to low and let the soup simmer for 45 minutes.For the croutons: Meanwhile, drizzle slices of French bread with olive oil and toast in the oven until golden. Set aside.To serve, turn on the oven broiler. Ladle the soup into ovenproof bowls. Place 1 or 2 pieces of the croutons on top of each serving of soup, depending on the size of the bowl. Place a thick slice of cheese on top of each bowl, then place the bowls on a baking sheet and broil just long enough for the cheese to become melted, bubbly and slightly toasted.Serve immediately.'

S'For the dough: Heat the milk, vegetable oil and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat to just below a boil. Set aside and cool to warm. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit on the milk for 1 minute.Add 8 cups of the flour. Stir until just combined, and then cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside in a relatively warm place for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove the towel and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt and the remaining 1 cup flour. Stir thoroughly to combine. Use the dough right away, or place in a mixing bowl and refrigerate for up to 3 days, punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl. (The dough is easier to work with if it\\\'s been chilled for at least an hour or so beforehand.)To assemble the rolls, remove half the dough from the pan. On a floured baking surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 30 by 10 inches. The dough should be rolled very thin.For the filling: Pour 3/4 cup to 1 cup of the melted butter over the surface of the dough. Use your fingers to spread the butter evenly. Generously sprinkle half of the ground cinnamon and 1 cup of the sugar over the butter. Don\\\'t be afraid to drizzle on more butter or more sugar! Gooey is the goal.Now, beginning at the end farthest from you, roll the rectangle tightly towards you. Use both hands and work slowly, being careful to keep the roll tight. Don\\\'t worry if the filling oozes as you work; that just means the rolls are going to be divine. When you reach the end, pinch the seam together and flip the roll so that the seam is face down. When you\\\'re finished, you\\\'ll wind up with one long buttery, cinnamony, sugary, gooey log.Slip a cutting board underneath the roll and, with a sharp knife, make 1/2-inch slices. One "log" will produce 20 to 25 rolls. Pour a couple of teaspoons of melted butter into disposable foil cake pans and swirl to coat. Place the sliced rolls in the pans, being careful not to overcrowd. (Each pan will hold 7 to 9 rolls.)Repeat the rolling/sugar/butter process with the other half of the dough and more pans.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cover all the pans with a kitchen towel and set aside to rise on the countertop for at least 20 minutes before baking.Remove the towel and bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Don\\\'t allow the rolls to become overly brown.While the rolls are baking, make the maple icing: In a large bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, butter, coffee and salt. Splash in the maple flavoring. Whisk until very smooth. Taste and add in more maple, sugar, butter or other ingredients as needed until the icing reaches the desired consistency. The icing should be somewhat thick but still very pourable.Remove the pans from the oven. Immediately drizzle the icing over the top. Be sure to get it all around the edges and over the top. As they sit, the rolls will absorb some of the icing\\\'s moisture and flavor. They only get better with time... not that they last for more than a few seconds. Make them for a friend today! It\\\'ll seal the relationship for life. I promise.'

S"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.For the topping: In a pan, melt the butter and add the pecans, corn syrup and vanilla. Let the mixture bubble up for a minute, then remove from the heat. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the mixture into each cup of three 24-hole mini-muffin tins.For the rolls: Roll out each piece of dough into a rectangle 6 inches wide and 24 inches long (should roll out very thin!). Pour a third of the melted butter on each piece, then sprinkle a third of the sugar and a third of the cinnamon evenly over each surface.Starting at the far end of 1 piece, roll the dough into a long roll, rolling toward you. You\\'ll end up with a 24-inch-long roll of dough. With a sharp knife, cut into very thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.Lay the sliced rolls into the muffin tins on top of the pecan mixture, tucking the tails under and patting them firmly on top of the topping. Bake until golden brown, 12 to 13 minutes.Turn out the rolls from the pans immediately. Invert carefully, so that the rolls turn out and the pecans stay stuck to the bottoms (which are now the tops!). If a little of the pecans stick in the tins, just dig them out with a spoon and reapply them to the rolls."

S'Special equipment: heart-shaped cookie cutter, alphabet stencils, tweezers and a small brushCombine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in a bowl. Whisk together and set aside.In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Add the vanilla and egg and beat until combined. Add the flour/cocoa mixture in 2 or 3 batches, mixing well after each addition. Place the dough into a large resealable plastic bag and flatten slightly with your hand. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 2 hours.To bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Dust a work surface with cocoa powder.Remove the dough from the bag and place on the cocoa powder-dusted surface for 5 to 10 minutes. Roll out to 1/4-inch thickness and cut with a heart cutter. You\\\'ll need to consolidate and re-roll the dough as you go. Place on the prepared baking sheet and bake until set but not browning at all, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool completely.To decorate the cookies with stenciled letters, Pink Buttercream or melted chocolate: Stencil some of the cookies with the alphabet stencils to spell out things like "Love You" and "Be Mine." Place the stencils on the cooled cookies and lay pieces of scrap paper on any areas of exposed cookie. Lightly sift powdered sugar over the stencils. Carefully remove the paper and stencils with tweezers, being careful not to drop powdered sugar as you remove them. Use a tiny brush to correct "errors."For the remaining cookies, frost with Pink Buttercream if desired, or drizzle with melted white chocolate. Arrange on a platter or in a basket and deliver to your sweetie! (Don\\\'t stack the cookies.)'

S"For the dough: In a large saucepan over a low heat, heat the milk, oil and granulated sugar until warm but not hot (if you have a candy thermometer, it should be 125 degrees F). Remove from the heat and add the yeast and 4 cups of the flour and stir together. Cover the pan and leave to rise for at least an hour. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup flour, the baking powder, baking soda and salt.For the filling: Roll the dough into a long rectangle, about 30 inches wide by 10 inches deep. You\\'ll want it to be as thin as you can get it so you can add plenty of goo. Drizzle the melted butter all over the surface of the dough. Use your fingers to smear it all around so that it coats evenly.Spread the orange marmalade all over the buttered dough, distributing as evenly as you can. Sprinkle plenty of brown sugar all over the marmalade. Finish with a light sprinkling of salt to offset the sweetness.Using both hands in a back-and-forth motion, gradually roll the dough towards you into one long log. Pinch the seam to seal it. Then slice the log-o\\'-dough into 1/2-inch pieces.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the rolls in a buttered baking dish and allow them to rise for 20 minutes.Bake for 15 to 17 minutes.While the rolls are baking, make the icing: Add the orange zest and juice to a bowl. Add the powdered sugar and salt. Splash in the milk. And some more melted butter because the recipe doesn\\'t already have enough. Just kidding on that last part. Whisk it together until it\\'s nice and smooth and lovely. Your kitchen smells like oranges!Pull the rolls out of the oven when they\\'re golden brown, and drizzle on the icing right off the bat. The piping hot rolls will suck that gorgeous icing right down into their crevices and the whole thing pretty much becomes a miracle. Serve them warm."

S"Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.Generously salt and pepper the chuck roast.Heat the olive oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the halved onions to the pot, browning them on both sides. Remove the onions to a plate.Throw the carrots into the same very hot pot and toss them around a bit until slightly browned, about a minute or so. Reserve the carrots with the onions.If needed, add a bit more olive oil to the very hot pot. Place the meat in the pot and sear it for about a minute on all sides until it is nice and brown all over. Remove the roast to a plate.With the burner still on high, use either red wine or beef broth (about 1 cup) to deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom with a whisk. Place the roast back into the pot and add enough beef stock to cover the meat halfway.Add in the onions and the carrots, along with the fresh herbs.Put the lid on, then roast for 3 hours for a 3-pound roast. For a 4 to 5-pound roast, plan on 4 hours. The roast is ready when it\\'s fall-apart tender."

Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and golden brown, several minutes. Add the diced potatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir to cook for a couple of minutes. Finally, add the asparagus, mushrooms, olives and roasted red peppers and cook, stirring, until everything is hot.Make sure all the ingredients are evenly distributed across the bottom of the skillet, then pour in the egg mixture so that it evenly coats everything. Let it sit on the burner for 30 to 45 seconds to set the edges, then put the skillet in the oven. Cook, watching it carefully, until the eggs are set but not very brown on top, 10 to 12 minutes.Slide the frittata out of the skillet and onto a cutting board. Sprinkle on the basil and slice into wedges with a long serrated knife.'

S'Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the penne until al dente (firm yet tender). Drain and set aside.Begin by peeling and deveining the shrimp and rinsing them under cold water.In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. When the pan is hot, add the shrimp. Stir and cook on both sides until just starting to turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Remove to a plate and allow to cool slightly.In a large skillet over medium heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the garlic and onion. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes.Pour the wine into the pan if using. Stir and allow it to evaporate, about 45 seconds. Pour in the tomato sauce and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low. Pour in the cream. Mmmm. Stir well to combine; reduce the heat to simmer.And now for the fun part: remove the tails from the shrimp, chop the shrimp into medium-size pieces and add them to the sauce. Stir gently to combine.Next, dump in the parsley and basil and stir. Add the cooked, drained pasta. Stir gently to coat. If the sauce is too thick, splash in a little milk to get it to the right consistency. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper. Be sure to taste the seasonings at the end, adjusting if necessary.Serve directly out of the skillet, or pour the contents of the skillet into a pretty serving bowl. Serve with crusty French bread - and more wine.From Food Network Kitchen: This recipe has been updated and may differ from what was originally published or broadcasted.'

S'With a very sharp knife, cut the chicken breasts in half down the middle. This will result in 8 chicken breast pieces that are thinner and uniform in size.Next, make the marinade. In a large bowl mix together the honey, mustard, paprika, salt, pepper to taste, lemon juice and crushed red pepper flakes if using. Stir to combine.Add the chicken to the marinade and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge, 2 to 4 hours.While the chicken marinates, fry up the bacon until chewy. When finished cooking, reserve 1/4 cup of the bacon grease and pour off the rest of the grease (but do not clean the skillet).When you are ready to cook the chicken, remove it from the marinade and cook it in the skillet over medium-high heat, 3 to 4 minutes each side. Brush a little reserved bacon grease on the chicken as you cook it. (Or you can grill the chicken breasts on an indoor or outdoor grill.)When a couple of minutes grilling time are left, lay 2 pieces of bacon onto each chicken breast. Top with some Cheddar and allow it to melt on the grill (if you need to remove the chicken you can finish melting the cheese under the broiler).Halve the rolls and immediately load with the bacon-and-cheese covered chicken.'

But it\\'s a good kind of stink, it\\'s a vinegary stink. Allow the reduction to cool to room temperature before you serve it.When you are ready to assemble the salad, cut the tomatoes into thick slices. Arrange them on a platter, alternating them with the mozzarella slices. Tuck the whole basil leaves in between the tomato and cheese slices.Drizzle on the gorgeous, almost black balsamic reduction. Then drizzle olive oil in a thin stream over the top. Finally, sprinkle on salt and pepper.You need this in your life. Make it today my friends."

S"For the steak: Begin with setting up an assembly line of dishes. Mix the milk with the eggs in one; the flour mixed with the seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, paprika and cayenne in another; and the meat in a third. Then have one clean plate at the end to receive the breaded meat.Work with one piece of meat at a time. Sprinkle both sides with kosher salt and black pepper, then place it in the flour mixture. Turn to coat. Place the meat into the milk/egg mixture, turning to coat. Finally, place it back in the flour and turn to coat (dry mixture/wet mixture/dry mixture). Place the breaded meat on the clean plate, then repeat with the remaining meat.Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Drop in a few sprinkles of flour to make sure it\\'s sufficiently hot. When the butter sizzles immediately, you know it\\'s ready. (It should not brown right away, if it does, the fire is too hot.) Cook the meat, 3 pieces at a time, until the edges start to look golden brown, about 2 minutes each side. Remove the meat to a paper towel-lined plate and keep them warm by covering lightly with another plate or a sheet of foil. Repeat until all the meat is cooked.After all the meat is fried, pour off the grease into a heatproof bowl. Without cleaning the skillet, return it to the stove over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup of the grease back to the skillet and allow it to heat up.For the gravy: When the grease is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over the grease. Using a whisk, mix the flour with the grease, creating a golden-brown paste. Add more flour if it looks overly greasy; add a little more grease if it becomes too pasty/clumpy. Keep cooking until the roux reaches a deep golden brown color.Pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Add the seasoned salt and black pepper to taste and cook, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Be prepared to add more milk if it becomes overly thick. Be sure to taste to make sure gravy is sufficiently seasoned.Serve the meat next to a big side of mashed potatoes. Pour gravy over the whole shebang!"

Add the carrots and celery, and then stir and cook for a couple more minutes. Throw in the cauliflower. Then stir it around, cover and cook over very low heat for 15 minutes.Add the parsley, and then add the chicken broth and simmer for 10 minutes.Meantime, make a simple white sauce: Melt the remaining 1/2 stick butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Then whisk in the flour. Cook for a couple of minutes, and then pour in the milk, whisking to combine. Remove the white sauce from the heat and pour in the half-and-half. Then pour this creamy mixture into the pot. Add 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste, and allow the soup to simmer for another 20 to 30 minutes. The soup will thicken slightly but shouldn\\'t be overly thick. Give it a taste and add more salt if needed.Now, this is the fun part: To serve the soup, place the room temperature sour cream in the bottom of a soup tureen (a very large serving bowl). Then add the whole pot of hot soup to the tureen.Stir gently to combine, and then serve immediately with warm rolls and an appetite for something wonderful.You will love everything about this.Variation: For a smoother, thicker soup, use an immersion blender to puree. Simmer an additional 10 minutes after pureeing."

Add the eggs one at a time, mixing after each addition. Combine the flour and salt in a small bowl, then add it to the butter-sugar mixture 1 cup at a time, mixing after each addition. With the mixer on low, slowly add the lemon-lime soda and mix until combined. Add the lemon and lime zests and mix. Scrape the bowl and mix again.Thoroughly spray a Bundt pan with nonstick baking spray. Add large spoonfuls of batter to the pan until filled, then even out the surface. Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes (a toothpick inserted in the center should not come out totally clean, but it shouldn\\'t be wet with batter either). Let the cake sit in the pan for 15 minutes, then carefully turn it out onto a cake plate and let it cool.For the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar, lemon zest and juice, lime zest and juice, salt and about 1 tablespoon water in a bowl and gently whisk until thick but pourable; add a little extra water if needed. Use a large spoon to drizzle the glaze all over the cake. Sprinkle over more zest to decorate. Let the glaze set before serving.Whip the heavy cream and granulated sugar together in a large bowl until it forms soft peaks. Slice the cake and serve with the whipped cream and berries!"

Form the mixture into uniform-size balls.Heat the oil and butter in a large pan. When hot, begin frying the meatballs in batches, setting them aside on a plate or baking sheet when brown. You may need to drain any excess fat from the pan during the frying process. Continue frying until all the meatballs are browned. Set aside.For the sauce: Add the beef consomme and three-quarters of the can of beef broth to the meatball pan, reserving the remaining broth in a small bowl. Add the mustard and tomato paste to the pan, then stir and bring to the boil.Add the cornstarch to the reserved beef broth and whisk so there are no lumps. As the sauce starts to boil, add the cornstarch mixture. When the sauce has thickened after a few minutes, return the meatballs to the pot and stir to make sure they are all coated in sauce. Continue to simmer until the meatballs are cooked through, about 45 minutes.'

In another bowl, whisk together the oil, milk, vanilla and eggs and stir in the grated zucchini. Fold this into the dry ingredients. The batter will be stiff and dry but keep folding it and it will all come together. If it still seems too dry, just add a little more milk.Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs and the cake is pulling away from the sides of the pan, about 20 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.For the frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with a mixer at medium speed until smooth. Beat in the powdered sugar and vanilla just until smooth. Add the milk if necessary.Spread the frosting over the top of the cooled cake. Garnish with chopped pecans.'

S"For the dressing: Place the anchovies into a blender or food processor. Throw in the Dijon mustard, vinegar, Worcestershire, garlic and lemon juice. Pulse the processor or blend on low speed for several seconds. Scrape down the sides.With the food processor or blender on, drizzle the olive oil into the mixture in a small stream. Scrape down the sides. Add the Parmesan, salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Pulse the whole thing together and mix until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate the dressing for a few hours (it just gets better!) before using it on the salad.For the croutons: Slice the bread into thick slices and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Throw them onto a baking sheet.Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan or skillet over low heat.Crush-but don\\'t chop-the garlic and add them to the oil. Use a spoon to move the garlic around in the pan. After 3 to 5 minutes, turn off the heat and remove the garlic from the pan.Slowly drizzle the olive oil over the bread cubes. Mix together with your hands, and then sprinkle lightly with salt. Toss and cook in the pan until golden brown and crisp. (Add a little butter for more flavor!)For the salad: Wash and dry the hearts of romaine lettuce. Leave them whole. Use a vegetable peeler and shave off large, thin slices of Parmesan.Drizzle about half of the dressing over the top of the hearts. Throw in a good handful of the Parmesan shavings. Give it a good initial toss, just so you can evaluate how much more dressing you need.Add more dressing and Parmesan to taste. Add the cooled croutons. Toss gently."

S"In a small skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and stir, lightly frying for about a minute, removing before the garlic gets too brown (it can be golden). Pour the garlic and oil into a mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly.Add the red and yellow tomatoes, balsamic and basil to the bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to combine, and then taste and add more basil if needed, and more salt if needed (don\\'t over salt, though!) Cover and refrigerate for an hour or two if you have the time.Cut the baguette into diagonal slices to allow for the most surface area possible. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet and grill half the bread on both sides, making sure they\\'re nice and buttery. Cook until golden brown on both sides. Repeat with the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and the other half of the bread.To serve, give the tomato mixture a final stir, and then spoon generously over the slices of bread. Serve on a big platter as a first course or appetizer."

S"Cook\\'s Notes: Only brine fresh turkeys. Brining a frozen turkey is never a good idea, because frozen turkeys are most typically injected with a sodium solution. There are some organic frozen turkeys that have a much lower concentration of the sodium solution. Generally speaking, though, you\\'ll want to brine fresh, not frozen, turkeys.Making gravy from the drippings of a brined turkey can result in a really salty gravy if you\\'re not careful. Don\\'t add salt to your gravy without tasting first; it may not need it."

S'To make the meatballs, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, milk, cream, parsley, mustard, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Mix together well with your hands. Scoop out 1-tablespoon portions and roll them into balls with your hands. Place the meatballs onto parchment-lined baking sheets and put the baking sheets in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes for the meatballs to firm up.To brown the meatballs, heat the olive oil in a heavy pot or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook, turning the meatballs to make sure they brown all over, 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.Freezer instructions: Put the cooked meatballs in a single layer on baking sheets and put into the freezer. When frozen, divide them into freezer bags, 25 per bag, and return them to the freezer. Yield: 125 meatballs.'

S"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Pour the cream into a saucepan over medium-low heat. Scrape the vanilla caviar from the vanilla bean and add it to the cream (or add the vanilla extract if using instead). Bring almost to the boil, and then turn off the heat.Place the egg yolks in a large bowl and add 3/4 cup sugar. With a whisk, mix the eggs and sugar together. Now, break out your elbow grease and take a deep breath. You\\'re going to need to whisk the mixture like crazy for 3 or 4 minutes, until it\\'s very light yellow in color.Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl. Pour the hot cream into the bowl through the strainer.To temper the egg mixture, very slowly drizzle 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg/sugar mixture, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from cooking. Continue adding the rest of the hot cream to the bowl very slowly, whisking constantly. You can add the cream a little more rapidly as the mixture warms.Place ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet and ladle in the custard until the ramekins are three-quarters full.Place the baking sheet inside the oven, and then pour water into the baking sheet until it reaches two-thirds of the way up the ramekins.Bake until the custard is set but not brown, 35 to 40 minutes, watching carefully to avoid browning.Remove the ramekins and allow to cool. Refrigerate the custards, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight.When you are ready to serve the dessert, sprinkle the top of each custard generously with superfine sugar. Use a kitchen torch to burn the sugar to a crisp, working quickly to avoid cooking the custard below. (You may also place the ramekins on a pan and put them right under the broiler, but you have to be careful not to affect the custard below.)Serve immediately with spoons."

Add the tomato juice.Next - and this is important - in order to combat the acidity of the tomatoes add 3 to 6 tablespoons of sugar. Now, you\\'ll want to start on the low side, then taste and add more as needed. Some tomatoes and juice have more of an acidic bite than others. (For what it\\'s worth, and I realize it\\'s not worth much, I use 6 tablespoons of sugar.)Next, add 1 or 2 tablespoons chicken base to the pot. I added 3, and it wound up being a little too much.Now you can add lots of freshly ground black pepper. Stir to combine, then heat almost to a boil. Then turn off the heat.Add in the sherry if desired. Stir in the cream. Add the basil and parsley and stir.Serve the soup warm!"

S'Blending Hot Liquids: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid; that prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.

S"For the salad: Put the chicken breasts into a large plastic storage bag. Pound with a mallet or rolling pin to flatten to 1/4-inch uniform thickness. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.Heat a grill and drizzle with the olive oil. Grill the chicken on both sides until done, about 7 minutes per side. (Rotate halfway during grilling each side to ensure pretty grill marks.) Set aside to cool.Grill the corn for a few minutes, until still crunchy but colored. With a very sharp knife, shave the kernels off each corn cob. Combine with the dill, celery and onions in a large bowl. Set aside.For the dressing: Mix together the feta, half-and-half, mayonnaise and sour cream in a bowl. Stir in the sugar, lemon juice and some salt and pepper. Stir, and then taste. Add more salt if necessary; do not undersalt!Slice the chicken on the bias to create flat, randomly shaped pieces. Throw into the bowl with the celery, onions and corn. Stir to combine. Pour half of the dressing over the ingredients and toss gently. Add more as desired, but don\\'t overcoat the salad; it should be light! At the end, toss in the blueberries to lightly coat them in the dressing.Spoon the salad into butter lettuce cups and then sprinkle individual helpings with feta and extra dill."

Store in a re-sealable plastic bag in the fridge.When you\\'re ready to bake the casserole, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the casserole from the fridge and sprinkle the topping over the top.

S'For the dipping sauce: Mix together the honey, soy sauce, Sriracha, vinegar and sesame oil in a small bowl and set aside.For the wontons: In the bowl of a mixer (or you can do it by hand), mix together the cream cheese, Sriracha and green onions until totally combined (scrape the mixer bowl if necessary). In a separate bowl, mix together the egg and 1/2 cup water.One at a time, assemble the wontons: Place approximately 1/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture on one corner of a wonton wrapper. Use your finger to "paint" the egg wash all around the edges of the wrapper. Roll the wrapper on a diagonal, starting with the cream cheese corner and stopping when half the wrapper is rolled and the cream cheese mixture is inside. Bring up the 2 ends and use the egg wash to stick them together. Allow the remaining pointed end to naturally tuck backward. (The wontons should resemble tortellini.) As you work, place the assembled wontons under plastic wrap or a light towel to keep them from drying out.Heat 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil in a large saucepan or medium skillet until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers just under 350 degrees F. (You don\\\'t want the oil too hot or it will burn the wontons! Experiment with a spare sheet of wonton wrappers to check.)In batches of 4 or 5 at a time, fry the wontons for 45 seconds to 1 minute, flipping carefully midway through to make sure they brown evenly. Remove them when you think they still could stand to slightly brown a teeny bit more (because they will slightly brown in the seconds after you remove them from the pan!). Drain the wontons on a paper towel. Repeat with the remaining batches.It\\\'s best to wait 5 to 10 minutes before serving the wontons, as the cream cheese filling can be quite hot. Serve with the dipping sauce.'

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 9-by-9-inch baking pan.Begin by pouring 1/3 cup evaporated milk into a bowl with the cake mix. Add the melted butter and the chopped pecans. Mix the ingredients together; it\\'ll be pretty thick!Divide the dough in half down the middle. Press half of it into the bottom of the prepared pan to make the first brownie layer. Bake until slightly set, 8 to 10 minutes. Then remove from the oven and set aside.While the brownie layer is baking, in a double boiler (or glass bowl set over a bowl of simmering water) combine the caramels and the remaining 1/2 cup evaporated milk. Stir occasionally until the caramels are totally melted and the mixture is smooth. Pour the caramel mixture over the first baked layer, spreading so it\\'s evenly distributed. Sprinkle the chocolate chips all over the top.Next, on a clean surface or a sheet of waxed paper, press the remaining dough into a square shape slightly smaller than the baking pan. Carefully set it on top of the chocolate chips. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and let the brownies cool to room temperature. Cover the pan and refrigerate the brownies for several hours to allow them to set.When you\\'re ready to serve them (or give them to someone you love!) sprinkle generously with the powdered sugar and cut them into large rectangles before removing from the pan. These are absolutely killer, my friends. Make them for someone you really, really love... or someone you want to love you back.It\\'ll work. Guarantee it."

Pour in the beer, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, sugar, paprika, salt and some pepper. Then return the beef to the pan, cover and simmer on a low heat until the meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If the liquid level gets too low, add more broth as needed.Add the carrots, parsnips and turnips and continue to simmer until the vegetables are tender and the liquid is reduced, about 30 minutes.If the stew is still too liquidy, remove a cup of cooking liquid from the pan and stir in the flour. Add the flour mixture back into the pan and stir. Simmer for 10 minutes until the stew is thick. The meat should be very tender; if it\\'s tough, let it continue to cook.To finish, add the parsley and stir through the stew."

S"With a sharp knife, carefully slice the chicken breast in half from top to bottom---meaning you\\'ll have two similarly-sized chicken breasts that are much thinner.Heat the butter and olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken breast pieces and pan-fry them on both sides until they\\'re done. Get as much golden brown color on the chicken as you can. When done, remove the chicken from the skillet and pour off any excess fat or oil (but don\\'t clean the pan).Return the chicken to the skillet and pour over the hot sauce. Turn the chicken to coat it on both sides and let it sit in the sauce while you prepare the other ingredients. (The heat should not be on under the skillet.)Toss the salad greens in a large bowl with just enough Fast Blue Cheese Dressing to lightly coat (thin the dressing with a little milk if it\\'s too gloopy). Heap some tossed salad into two individual bowls. Sprinkle blue cheese crumbles over the top. Slice the chicken into thin slices (on the bias) and arrange them over the top of each salad. (Dip the slices back into the sauce if necessary to really coat them.)Top the whole thing with more blue cheese crumbles, and serve with celery hearts."

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

Form into 4 to 6 oval patties, and then make lines across the patties to give them a "steak" appearance.Fry the patties in a skillet with the butter and oil over medium-high heat on both sides until no longer pink in the middle. Remove from the skillet and pour off any excess grease.For the gravy: Reduce the heat to medium and add in the sliced onions. Stir and cook until golden brown and somewhat soft, for several minutes. Add the beef stock, ketchup, seasoning sauce, if using, and the Worcestershire. Then combine the cornstarch with a little beef broth and add to the sauce if using. Stir and cook to reduce.Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper and more broth if needed for thinning. Then return the patties to the gravy.

Turn off the blender and add in a little salt and cayenne. Whip it again until combined. Set this aside for a minute.Next, poach an egg by gently cracking an egg into simmering, slightly bubbling water.Leave the egg alone for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, and then remove it with a slotted spoon and carefully place it on a plate. Repeat with the remaining eggs.To serve, place a buttered, toasted English muffin half on a plate. Top the English muffin with a warm slice of Canadian bacon. Place the warm poached egg on top. And then drizzle on some warm hollandaise. Sprinkle a little paprika on top.Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the crust: Line a 9-by-13-inch rectangular baking pan with foil and spray with cooking spray.Place the vanilla wafers and pecans into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture becomes crumbs. Add the melted butter and pulse again until combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan. (If they come up the sides, that\\'s okay!)For the filling: Beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla together in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the sour cream and mix again.Pour the filling into the crust, smooth the top and bake for 50 minutes. Turn off the oven, open the oven door and allow the pan to sit in the open oven for 15 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool.For the topping: Add the blackberries, sugar and 1/4 cup water to a saucepan or skillet. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the juices thicken slightly, 4 to 5 minutes.In a small bowl, make a slurry by stirring together the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water until smooth. Add the slurry to the berries, return to the boil and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and cool the mixture.Pour the blackberries over the cheesecake and place the pan into the fridge to cool and set for at least 2 hours (several hours is better).When ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the pan by lifting the edges of the foil. Slice into 15 pieces with a long serrated knife."

S"Place the mason jars in a large hot water bath canner (or pot). Cover with water and bring to a simmer. Simmer the center lids in separate saucepan full of water.Place the mashed strawberries and lemon juice in a separate pot. Stir in the pectin until dissolved. Bring the strawberries to a strong boil.Add the sugar (measure beforehand so you can add it all at once), and then return the mixture to a full (violent) boil that can\\'t be stirred down. Boil hard for 1 minute 15 seconds. Skim foam off the top.Remove one jar at a time from the simmering water. Pour water back into the pot. Using a wide-mouth funnel, fill each jar with jam, being careful to keep the liquid/fruit ratio consistent. Fill the jars so that they have 1/4-inch of space at the top. Run a knife down the side of the jar to get rid of air bubbles. Wipe the rim of the jar with a wet cloth to remove any residue or stickiness.Remove the center lid from the simmering water and position it on top. Put screw bands on jars, but do not over tighten! Repeat with all the jars, and then place the jars on a canning rack and lower into the water. Place the lid on the canner, and then bring the water to a full boil. Boil hard for 10 to 12 minutes.Turn off the heat and allow the jars to remain in the hot water for an addition 5 minutes.Remove the jars from the water using a jar lifter, and allow them to sit undisturbed for 24 hours.After 24 hours, remove the screw bands and check the seal of the jars. The center lids should have no give whatsoever. If any seals are compromised, store those jars in the fridge. Otherwise, fill your pantry with your newly canned goodness. Cook\\'s Notes: Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed. To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products."

S'Wash and clean the potatoes in cold running water. Using a mandoline, or vegetable peeler, finely slice the potatoes into chips. Drop the chips into a bowl of ice water as you work to prevent them from going brown. This will also remove any excess starch.In a heavy Dutch oven, heat oil to 400 degrees F(use a thermometer to keep the temp right!). When it\\\'s hot enough, lay the potatoes on baking sheet lined with paper towels, and blot them with more paper towels to dry.Lower batches of potatoes into the oil using a spatula. They will fry very quickly; stir with a heavy metal spoon as they fry to get them to be the "kettle" style. Remove with a slotted spoon when they\\\'re nice and golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Immediately sprinkle on salt and lots of black pepper. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes! Serve very soon after frying.'

S"Special equipment: a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter and a frosting (piping) bag and tipFor the best chocolate sheet cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Use an 18-by-13-inch sheet cake pan. Cut parchment paper to fit the pan and spray each side with baking spray.In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt. In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the cocoa to the butter and stir together. Add 1 cup boiling water to the pan and then allow the mixture to boil for 30 seconds. Pour over the flour mixture, and stir lightly to cool.Pour the buttermilk into a bowl and add the baking soda, vanilla and beaten eggs. Stir the buttermilk mixture into the butter/flour mixture. Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake for 20 minutes. Let the cake cool completely.Cut the cooled cake into circles with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, and then lay the circles on another sheet pan with a wire rack; set this pan in the fridge to make sure there is no warmth to the cake at all. (The frosting is so light and fluffy, the coolness will help keep it all together.)For the white frosting: In a small saucepan, whisk the flour into the milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens. You want it to be very thick--thicker than cake mix, more like a brownie mix. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. If in a hurry, place the saucepan over ice in the sink for about 10 minutes or so until the mixture cools. It must be completely cool before you use it in the next step. Stir in the vanilla.While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. You don\\'t want any sugar graininess left. Then add the completely cooled milk/flour mixture and beat the living daylights out of it. If it looks separated, you haven\\'t beaten it enough! Beat it until it all combines and resembles whipped cream. Grab a spoon and taste this wonderful goodness. If there is any left after your taste test, spread it on a cooled chocolate cake.For the ganache: Heat the cream until very hot. Add the vanilla, and then pour over the chocolate pieces. Stir to completely melt.To assemble: Place the white frosting into a frosting bag. Squeeze the frosting onto one circle of cake. Press a second circle on top. Using a ladle, pour ganache over the cake, allowing the chocolate to run over the sides. Place 3 cherries on the center. Repeat the process with each cake. Chill the cakes until ready to serve!"

Alternate adding the dry ingredients and milk in 3 batches, mixing for a few seconds after each addition. Scrape the sides of the bowl, then mix 1 final time.Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans and bake until done (a wooden skewer inserted in the cake should come out completely clean), 28 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then turn out to cool completely.For the buttercream frosting: Sift the powdered sugar and cocoa together in a large bowl and set aside.In an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Turn off the mixer and add half of the sugar/cocoa mixture. Turn to low speed and mix to combine. Add the rest of the mixture and mix again. Add the cream, vanilla and salt, scrape the sides and beat until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Thin out with a tablespoon of cream at a time if needed.Ice the cake with a generous layer in the center and spread all around the sides. WARNING: MUST BE SERVED WITH A GLASS OF COLD MILK!'

Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until brown, and then remove the meat to a plate.Add the mushrooms, garlic, bell peppers and onions to the pot and saute until the mushrooms have softened and the others have some color. Add the meat back in along with the tomatoes, tomato paste, pesto, half the parsley, 1 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper and the crushed red pepper flakes. Stir, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Add the black olives and stir.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To make the cheese mixture: Combine the ricotta and eggs in a large bowl. Add the Parmesan, the rest of the parsley and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Stir the mixture until totally combined.To assemble the lasagna: Overlap 4 lasagna noodles in the bottom of a large rectangular baking dish. Spoon half the cheese mixture over the noodles and smooth it out into a flat layer. Lay half of the mozzarella slices on top followed by half of the meat sauce. Repeat these layers once more and top with some extra Parmesan. Bake until heated through and bubbly on the top, 40 to 45 minutes.'

Grill the chicken legs until cooked all the way through, turning occasionally so the chicken is cooked on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes.Separate the tortillas into 2 piles of 16, and then wrap each pile in foil and warm over the grill for 10 to 15 minutes.Serve the chicken legs with the warm tortillas, pico de gallo, refried beans and chipotle salsa.'

Gently stir in the flour until halfway incorporated. Pour the batter (it will be very thick!) into the prepared pan.Place the dulce de leche in a glass bowl. Warm it in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds. Drop large dollops of dulce de leche on the surface of the brownie batter. Use a knife to slowly swirl it through the batter. Don\\'t drag the knife sideways through the batter; hold it so the thin side of the knife leads the way.Bake for 40 minutes, then check the brownies with a toothpick. If they are overly gooey/messy, return to the oven for 5 to 10 more minutes (just be careful not to burn the edges).

S"For the meatballs: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Place the bread on a baking sheet. Bake until totally dry, about 30 minutes.Break the bread into chunks. Pulse in a food processor until the bread turns into crumbs. Throw in the meat into a large mixing bowl. Add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, milk, parsley, garlic, eggs, salt and some pepper. Use clean hands to mix together until well combined.Use a scoop to retrieve a small amount of the meat mixture, and roll it in your hands to make meatballs (about 25). Place on a pan and put the pan in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes, just to firm them up.Heat the olive oil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. Working with 8 to 10 meatballs at a time, cook them until brown but not cooked all the way through, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Remove from the pot to a plate while you make the sauce.For the sauce: Add the garlic and onions to the meatball pot. Stir and cook until the onion begins to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook for another minute. (Just omit this step if you\\'re not using wine.) Add the crushed tomatoes, whole tomatoes, sugar, salt and pepper to taste.Stir the sauce to combine all the ingredients. Cover and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. If sauce needs more liquid, just add in a little water. Then throw in the parsley, basil and the meat-a-balls! Stir gently, then cover and cook for 20 more minutes, stirring once or twice until the meatballs are cooked through.Heap the rigatoni on a large platter and pile the meatballs and sauce on the top. Sprinkle on some extra minced parsley and serve with extra grated Parmesan."

Cut into 8 to 10 long rectangles, using a butter knife.Spoon a tablespoon or so of filling into the top half of one of the rectangles.Use the remaining beaten eggs to seal the edges by folding the bottom half of the rectangle over the top. Then crimp the edges shut with a fork. Repeat with the other pies, filling half with apple pie filling and half with cherry pie filling.Heat shortening in a medium, deep saucepan over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F.

S'Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Salt and pepper the ribs, then dredge them in the flour. Set aside.In a large Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until completely crispy and all the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon and set aside. Drain off any excess fat.Add the olive oil to the pan with the bacon fat and raise the heat to high. Brown the ribs on all sides, about 45 seconds per side. Remove the ribs and set aside.Lower the heat to medium. Add the carrots, shallots and onions to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Splash in the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan to release all the flavorful bits of glory. Add the broth, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper and bring to a boil. Taste and add more salt if needed. Add the ribs to the liquid; they should be almost completely submerged. Add the thyme and rosemary sprigs (whole) to the liquid. Finally, add the cooked bacon.Put on a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook until the ribs are fork-tender and falling off the bone, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove the pan from the oven and allow to sit for at least 20 minutes with the lid on before serving. At the last minute, skim the fat off the top of the liquid. (You can also refrigerate the mixture, then remove the solid fat from the top.)For each serving, arrange 2 ribs on a bed of the grits, spooning a little juice over the top.'

In a medium bowl, combine the other half of the herbs, the cottage cheese, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan and the eggs, and stir together well.Now let\\'s assemble the lasagna! Begin by laying 4 lasagna noodles in the bottom of a deep rectangular baking pan; the noodles should slightly overlap. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture onto the noodles; spread to distribute evenly. Sprinkle half the mozzarella on top of the cottage cheese mixture. Spoon just under half the meat mixture on top of the mozzarella, and spread evenly, being careful not to disrupt the layers below. Now repeat the process, beginning with a layer of lasagna noodles, followed by the cottage cheese mixture, followed by the mozzarella and ending with a thick layer of the meat mixture.Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan over the top. Bake until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, 35 to 45 minutes. Allow to stand 10 minutes before cutting into squares."

S'Cook the noodles according to the package directions.In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, sherry, cornstarch, brown sugar, ginger, chili paste, garlic and the juice of half the lime. Pour a third of the marinade into a bowl with the sliced beef and toss to coat. Reserve the rest of the marinade for later.Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high to high heat. When it is very hot, throw in the onions and cook for a minute or so. Add the bell peppers and jalapenos. Cook for a minute, tossing until the peppers have brown/black bits but are still firm. Remove the vegetables to a plate.Into the hot skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the meat mixture, evenly distributing it over the surface of the skillet. Allow to sit for 45 seconds, then turn with tongs. Cook for another 30 seconds, then add the onions and peppers back into the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Pour in the remaining marinade and stir. Allow to simmer on low for a few minutes; the sauce will slowly thicken. Turn off the heat.Drain the noodles, then add half of them to the stir-fry. Toss and add more noodles as desired. Stir in some very hot water if needed to thin the sauce.Top with basil and cilantro leaves and serve immediately with a squeeze of the remaining lime half.'

S'For the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Pour the milk over the bread and allow it to soak in for several minutes. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, salt, some pepper, seasoned salt and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in the eggs. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined.Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a foil-lined broiler pan, which will allow the fat from the meat to drain.Lay the bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf to give the meatloaf some support.Next, make the tomato sauce: Pour the ketchup into a bowl. Add the brown sugar and dry mustard, and splash in the hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Stir the mixture until well combined. Pour one-third of the sauce over the top of the meatloaf.Bake for 45 minutes, and then pour over another one-third of the remaining tomato sauce over the meatloaf. Bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes; the meatloaf should be no longer pink in the middle. Allow to sit 10 minutes before serving.Serve with the remaining tomato sauce on the side as a dipping sauce.'

S"Peel and rinse the potatoes. Cut each potato lengthwise into 4 or 5 pieces, then cut each piece into sticks. The thinner these are, the crispier they will be. Place the fries in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, then allow them to soak 2 or 3 hours (or you can stick them in the fridge and let them soak overnight).When you\\'re ready to make the fries, drain the water and lay the potatoes on 2 baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot with paper towels to dry.Heat a few inches of vegetable oil to 300 degrees F in a heavy pot. In 3 or 4 batches, fry the potatoes about 4 to 5 minutes per batch, or until soft. They should not be brown at all at this point-you just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain them on new, dry paper towels.Once all the potatoes have been fried at 300 degrees F, turn up the heat until the oil temperature reaches 400 degrees F. When the oil is hot, start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until golden and crisp. Remove from the oil and drain on fresh paper towels. Sprinkle the fries with sea salt and dive in with the ketchup-mayo mixture.Photograph by Kang Kim"

S"For the chicken: Generously sprinkle both sides of the breasts with the taco seasoning. Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken on both sides until deep golden brown on the outside and done in the middle (or to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F), about 4 minutes per side. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes.For the dressing: While the chicken is cooking, pour the ranch dressing into a bowl. Add the salsa and cilantro and stir to combine.For the salad: Next, place the ears of corn in the skillet you used to cook the chicken and roll them around so that the flavorful oil/butter mixture coats the corn. Grill on a grill pan or cook in a separate skillet until the corn is still crisp but has color on the outside. Slice off the kernels with a sharp knife and set aside. Dice the chicken into cubes.On a platter, layer the shredded lettuce, diced chicken, tomatoes, cheese, corn, avocados, green onions, cilantro and crushed chips. Drizzle the dressing all over the top, saving some to serve on the side if you\\'d like. Serve the salad in individual bowls."

S"Start by putting the chicken in a pot and covering it with water. Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot. Set the chicken aside to cool briefly.Shred the chicken with 2 forks, reserving the bones. Return the bones to the pot and boil for 20 minutes. Remove the bones from the pot and discard.Add the shredded chicken, carrots, celery and onions to the pot. Then add the salt, pepper, thyme and turmeric. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the noodles; no need to thaw them first!Finally, mix the flour with 1/2 cup water until smooth. Stir the flour mixture, the splash of half and half (if you\\'re into that kind of thing) and the minced parsley into the pot. Simmer until the noodles are tender, about 15 minutes, tasting and adding more salt if needed at the end. The soup should be thick and stew-like and your kitchen should smell like home."

S'To make the meatballs, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, milk, cream, parsley, mustard, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Mix together well with your hands. Scoop out 1-tablespoon portions and roll them into balls with your hands. Place the meatballs onto parchment-lined baking sheets and put the baking sheets in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes for the meatballs to firm up.To brown the meatballs, heat the olive oil in a heavy pot or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook, turning the meatballs to make sure they brown all over, 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.Freezer instructions: Put the cooked meatballs in a single layer on baking sheets and put into the freezer. When frozen, divide them into freezer bags, 25 per bag, and return them to the freezer.'

S"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Stir together and set aside.In another bowl, mix the buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla and eggs. Mix with a fork and set aside.In a medium saucepan, melt the butter and add the cocoa. Whisk together to combine. Meanwhile, bring 1 cup water to a boil. When the butter is melted, pour the boiling water in the pan. Allow to bubble for a moment, then turn off the heat. Pour the chocolate mixture into the flour mixture. Stir together for a moment to cool the chocolate, then pour in the egg mixture. Stir together until smooth, then pour into an ungreased jelly roll pan (or rimmed baking sheet) and bake for 20 minutes.While the cake is baking, make the icing: Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the cocoa powder and stir until smooth. Add the milk, vanilla and powdered sugar. Stir together. Dump in the pecans and stir until well combined.Immediately after removing the cake from the oven, pour the warm icing over the top. You\\'ll want to avoid doing much spreading, so try to distribute it evenly as you pour.Cook\\'s Notes:For a child\\'s birthday, omit pecans in the icing. Serve the cake with a large bowl of M and M\\'s and allow the kids to decorate it themselves.This cake can also be made into cupcakes: Just fill muffin tins a little less full with the batter than you normally would so the baked cupcakes remain below the upper rim. That way, the thin icing can be poured into each tin."

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S'Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.To begin, just throw the brown sugar, vinegar, olive oil, salt, dried oregano, cumin, chili powder, garlic and some pepper into a food processor or blender. (I happen to love brown sugar in my cooking, but you can decrease it or omit it if you like.) Cut 1 of the onions into quarters and put it in the food processor with the spices. Blend the ingredients until totally combined and then pour it over the pork shoulder. Now rub it into every nook and cranny of the meat, tucking it under folds and in crevices. Let no stone go unturned.Cut the remaining 3 onions into wedges and make a bed of onions in a large Dutch oven. Place the pork on the onions and add a couple of cups of water. Cover tightly and roast until fork-tender, 6 to 7 hours, turning every hour. Crank up the heat to 400 degrees F, remove the lid and roast skin-side up for another 15 to 20 minutes to get the skin crispy. Let the pork rest for 15 minutes before shredding.Shred the pork (2 forks work well) and put the meat into a pan or serving dish. Pour the juices and onions over the meat. Serve with lime wedges, sour cream, pico de gallo, tomatillo salsa ... whatever makes your skirt fly up!'

S'For the vegetables: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the carrots and cook, about 1 minute. Then add the broccoli and cook, about 1 additional minute. Add the red peppers and cook, about 1 minute. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set aside.To the skillet, add the butter and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and allow it to heat up. Add the mushrooms, zucchini and squash and cook until the vegetables are starting to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the skillet, add to the other vegetables and set aside.For the sauce: Add the garlic and onions to the skillet and cook until starting to turn translucent, about 2 minutes.Next, pour in the chicken broth and wine and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen all the flavorful bits. Cook the liquid for 3 to 4 minutes, allowing it to reduce by about half. Stir in the cream and Parmesan and allow the cheese to melt. Add salt and black pepper to taste.Add all the vegetables to the sauce along with the peas and basil. Stir to combine. If the sauce needs a little more liquid, splash a small amount of broth as needed. Place the cooked pasta in a large serving bowl and pour all the contents of the skillet over the pasta. Toss to combine. Sprinkle with extra basil and serve with extra Parmesan.'

S"For the buttery lemon noodles: Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain and set aside.For the chicken piccata: Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides, then dredge in the flour.Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the chicken breasts until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes on each side; fry them a little longer if the breasts are thicker, monitoring the oil/butter mixture to make sure it doesn\\'t burn. Remove the chicken to a plate.Add the garlic to the skillet and saute. Pour in the chicken broth and wine, and squeeze in the juice of the lemon. Whisk the sauce, scraping the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to cook and bubble and thicken until reduced by about half. Sprinkle in a little salt and pepper as it\\'s cooking.Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the cream. Add the capers, then cook for a couple of minutes until the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Expect the sauce to have a real tang to it; counter it with a little more broth and cream if it\\'s too strong!To finish the noodles, melt the butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Throw in the cooked pasta, along with the parsley. Cook it in the butter for a couple of minutes so that a few of the noodles get a little bit of a pan-fried texture to them. Grate in some lemon zest and squeeze in some lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.Place a handful of arugula on each plate, some noodles and a chicken breast. Garnish with Parmesan shavings and chopped parsley, then spoon over the sauce."

S"Special equipment: a pastry cutterFor the perfect spiced pie crust: Mix the flour, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a bowl. Add the butter and vegetable shortening. Work the butter into the flour using a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. Add the white vinegar, egg and 5 tablespoons cold water and stir until just combined.Form 2 equal-sized balls. Place each in a large plastic bag (do not seal) and slightly flatten with a rolling pin; this makes it much easier to roll out the crust later. After flattening, seal the bag tightly. Place in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to chill.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Remove 1 bag of dough from the freezer (save the other dough for another use), remove the dough from the bag and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough starting at the center and working outward. Be gentle and patient; it\\'ll take a little time to get the dough completely rolled out. If you think the bottom is really sticking to the surface below while rolling, use a metal spatula to loosen it. When fully rolled out, loosen again with a spatula and lift the pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan (or you can roll the pastry over the rolling pin, lift it onto the pie pan and unroll it). Gently press the dough against the corner of the pan and tear off any excess dough. Then tuck under the edges and go around the pie pan pinching the dough to crimp the edge.For the pie filling: In a bowl, mix the apples, lemon juice, granulated sugar, flour and salt. Set aside.For the crumb topping: Cut the butter into the flour with a pastry cutter, then add in brown sugar, oats and salt.Add the apples to the prepared pie shell and top with the crumb topping. Bake for 1 hour, covering the edge of the crust with foil if it starts to brown too quickly. After an hour, sprinkle the chopped pecans over the pie, then bake for a further 5 minutes.Remove the pie from the oven and pour 1/2 jar (or more, if you\\'re feeling dangerous and naughty) of caramel topping over the top. Allow to cool slightly before serving--or don\\'t if you can\\'t wait!"

S"Trim off the excess fat from the meat, and then cut strips less than 1-inch wide. Rotate the meat and cut into small bite-size pieces. If you see any more large chunks of fat, gristle or long silvery membrane, cut them off.Sprinkle generously with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Toss the meat around a bit to thoroughly coat with the seasonings.Next, turn on your ventilation fan-you\\'ll need it! Heat the skillet over medium-high to high heat. As the pan heats, add about 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet. Allow the butter to melt, and then get very brown, before you add the meat.Place some of the meat in the pan in a single layer. It should sizzle loudly when it hits the pan - if it doesn\\'t, the pan isn\\'t hot enough. Don\\'t stir or disrupt the meat for 30 to 45 seconds. You want it to sizzle and brown on one side. Scoop as many steak bites as you can with your spatula and flip them over. Repeat until all the meat is turned. Cook for an additional 30 to 45 seconds-just long enough to sear the outside of the meat but NOT cook the inside.Remove the meat to a clean plate. Add a little more butter to the pan and repeat the cooking process with the next batch just as before. Lastly, when all the meat is nicely browned and removed to the plate, pour all that browned/blackened butter all over the meat. And enjoy!"

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

Add the onions and saute until light golden brown. Set aside.Remove the roast from the pot and shred the meat completely using two forks. Return the meat to the cooking liquid and keep warm.To serve, slice wedges out of the tops of the deli rolls. Heap a generous portion of meat on each roll, and then spoon some of the cooking liquid over the meat. Top with a few peppers from the pot and plenty of caramelized onions. Top the sandwiches with the wedges of roll and serve to a roomful of ravenous guests. Youll win friends and influence people.'

S'Blending Hot Liquids: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid; that prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times, then process on high speed until smooth.'

Squeeze juice from the lemon half and stir in with the peaches and zest. Add 2 tablespoons of the maple syrup to the peaches and stir well.Pour the peach mixture into a small pan (8 or 9-inch square) and cover evenly with the crumb topping. Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until crisp and brown on top, an additional 20 to 30 minutes.For the maple cream sauce, pour the heavy cream into a saucepan. Add  the remaining 5 tablespoons maple syrup and corn syrup and stir over moderate heat until thickened and reduced by about one-third, about 15 minutes. Refrigerate the sauce until it is cold and thick. Or, if you\\'re in a hurry, set the saucepan into a small bowl of ice (the ice will melt and turn into ice water). Stirring your mixture, it will cool and thicken in about 15 minutes. Drizzle the maple cream sauce over the peach crisp. Serve warm."

Carefully drop the chicken into the oil and move it around, flipping gently, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Let the pieces drain on a plate lined with paper towels for 2 to 3 minutes. Then drop them back into the oil for 1 minute to really solidify the coating.Toss the chicken in the sauce and serve.'

S"For the cowboy butter: Well in advance, make the cowboy butter. Place the softened butter in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Whip the butter until it\\'s fluffy. Add the parsley, red pepper flakes, black pepper, garlic, lemon zest and the juice of half the lemon. Mix it until it\\'s totally combined, scraping the sides as needed. Add more parsley, more lemon juice, more pepper or salt if you\\'d like.Lay out a long piece of plastic wrap and scoop the butter mixture in a long strip down the middle of it. Carefully pull one side of the plastic wrap over the butter, squeezing it gently to form it into a log. Continue to roll the log of butter into a roll. When it\\'s all rolled up, twist the ends (like a piece of candy) until they become very taut (this means the butter is pressing together inside the plastic to form a cohesive roll). Place the roll of butter into the fridge so it will harden, or into the freezer if you need to speed along the process.For the steaks: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the steaks.Melt the butter in a heavy ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. When it\\'s melted and golden brown, sear the steaks for about 45 seconds per side. Set in the oven to finish, about 3 minutes.Lay a thick slice of cowboy butter on top of each steak so it will begin to melt. Serve within 5 minutes."

S"Throw the cookies and melted butter into a food processor and pulverize. (Or, if you have some aggression or energy to expend, you can crush them in a large resealable plastic bag using a rolling pin!) Set a small handful of crumbs aside to sprinkle over the finished pie. Pour the rest into a pie pan and press into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Set aside.Heat the marshmallow and half-and-half in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. As soon as it\\'s all melted and combined, place the saucepan in a bowl of ice to cool down quickly. (Stirring occasionally will hasten this process.) Once cool, add the creme de menthe and creme de cacao. Taste and add more creme de menthe if needed. Add the green food coloring if using.In a mixing bowl, beat the cream until stiff. Pour the cold marshmallow mixture into the whipped cream and fold together gently. Pour the filling into the chocolate crust. Sprinkle over the reserved cookie crumbs.Freeze until very firm, about 2 hours. Remove from the freezer 10 minutes or so before you want to slice and serve."

Heat the butter and olive oil over high heat in a large skillet. Add the chicken chunks in a single layer and do not stir for a minute or two in order to allow the chicken to brown on the first side. Flip the chicken and brown on the other side. Cook until done, and then remove the chicken from the skillet.Turn the heat to medium. Add the garlic and quickly stir to avoid burning. After about 30 seconds, pour in the broth and wine, stirring to deglaze the skillet. Allow the liquid to bubble up, and then continue cooking until it\\'s reduced by at least half (most of the surface of the liquid should be bubbling at this point).Turn off the heat. Add the spinach, tomatoes, chicken, cooked pasta and Parmesan shavings to the skillet. Toss to combine; the spinach will wilt as you toss everything.Add more Parmesan shavings and serve immediately!

Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan.In a medium-large saucepan, melt the butter with the bittersweet chocolate over low heat, whisking occasionally until smooth and melted. Sprinkle in the cocoa powder and whisk to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool for about 5 minutes.Stir the sugar and vanilla into the chocolate mixture until just combined. One at a time, stir in the eggs. Gently stir in the flour until halfway incorporated. Add the chocolate chips and stir just until combined.Sprinkle half of the pretzels in the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Pour the batter (it will be very thick!) in the pan over the pretzels. Spread to even out the top and arrange the remaining pretzels all over the top.Bake for 40 minutes, then check the brownies with a toothpick. If overly gooey/messy, return the pan to the oven for 5 to 10 more minutes, being careful not to burn the edges. Allow to cool completely (important!), then cut into small squares.'

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

Place the beef on a rack on a roasting pan and roast it in the oven until medium-rare, 25 to 30 minutes (use a meat thermometer and monitor it till it\\'s medium-rare). Remove the meat from the oven and place on a cutting board to rest.Place the roasting pan on the burner on medium-high heat. Add the garlic and sliced onions to the drippings, stirring around to cook until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add the soup mix.Pour in the consomme, stock, 1 cup water, the sherry, Worcestershire, soy sauce and the remaining 1 tablespoon pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour. Pour through a fine mesh strainer and keep warm.Slice the rested beef very, very thinly.Split the rolls and spread with butter. Then grill the rolls on a griddle or in a skillet until golden brown and crisp.To build the sandwiches, pile sliced meat on the bottom half, dip the sliced beef quickly into the jus before putting on the roll, then top with the top half of the roll. Serve with little dishes of au jus.Melt provolone on top if desired."

Remove the potatoes from the oven. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F.With a sharp knife, cut each potato in half lengthwise. Scrape out the insides into the mixing bowl, being careful not to tear the shell. Leave a small rim of potato intact for support. Lay the hollowed out potato shells on a baking sheet.Smash the potatoes into the butter, bacon and sour cream. Add the cheese, milk, seasoned salt, green onions and black pepper to taste and mix together well. (IMPORTANT: If you plan to freeze the twice-baked potatoes, do NOT add the green onions.)Fill the potato shells with the filling. I like to fill the shells so they look abundant and heaping.

S'Cook the rice according to the package directions. Set aside.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and add the tomatoes, garlic and onions. Stir and cook for a minute or 2. Add 2 teaspoons of the chili powder, 1 teaspoon of the paprika and 1 teaspoon of the cumin. Stir and cook the mixture for another minute or 2 in order to release the flavors. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside.In the same skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add the chicken along with the remaining 2 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon cumin and some salt and pepper and cook until the chicken is deep golden brown and done in the middle, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water and stir to make a sauce. Allow the sauce to boil until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in the pinto and kidney beans and set aside.To assemble, pour half of the jar of salsa verde (about a cup) in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish or disposable foil baking pan. Layer half of the tortillas on top of the salsa verde, overlapping the edges. Spoon the rice over the tortillas, spread the tomato mixture over the rice then sprinkle the corn over the tomatoes. Next, add the chicken and bean mixture, then sprinkle on half the cheese and pour over half the enchilada sauce. Next, add the remaining tortillas in a layer, pour on the rest of the salsa verde and enchilada sauce and sprinkle on the rest of the cheese.Cover the casserole with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until hot and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow the casserole to sit for a few minutes before serving up to ensure it holds together. Serve with sour cream and cilantro for topping.'

S'Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and saute until starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ground beef and sausage and cook until browned. Drain off almost all of the fat, leaving a bit behind for flavor and moisture. Add the tomato sauce, tomatoes, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and some salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove 3 to 4 cups of the cooked sauce to a bowl to cool down.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add some salt. Cook the ziti until not quite al dente.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.In a bowl, mix 2 cups of the grated mozzarella, the ricotta, Parmesan, parsley, eggs and some salt and pepper. Stir together just a couple of times (do not mix completely).Drain the pasta and rinse under cool water to stop the cooking and cool it down. Pour it into the bowl with the cheese mixture and toss to slightly combine (there should still be large lumps). Add the cooled reserved meat sauce and toss to combine.Add half the coated pasta to a large casserole dish or lasagna dish. Spoon half of the remaining sauce over the top, then top with half the remaining mozzarella. Repeat with another layer of the coated pasta and the remaining sauce and mozzarella.Bake until bubbling, about 20 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before sprinkling with chopped parsley to serve.'
