S'For the pie: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper. Set aside.Unfold or unroll one sheet of the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Gently roll with a rolling pin until each side is increased by about 1/2-inch. Place the pastry on the prepared baking sheet and brush the pastry from edge to edge with prepared egg wash. Combine the mustard, apricot jam and a generous amount of black pepper in a small bowl, and spread over the egg wash, leaving about an inch border between the mustard and the edge of pastry. Place the ham evenly over the mustard and then evenly spread the cheese over the ham.Roll out the second piece of puff pastry as the first, increasing the size by about 1/2-inch on each side. Gently place it on top of the ham and cheese and press the edges together with your fingers. Gently fold about 1/2-inch of the edges over, creating a thick crust. Press the edges with the tines of a fork. Dip the fork in flour if it sticks to the puff pastry during pressing. Lightly brush a layer of egg wash over the top and edges of the pie. Cut a few small slits into the top of the pie and bake until cooked through and golden brown, 30 minutes.For the greens: Whisk together the vinegar and jam in a small bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Put the greens in large bowl, toss with the vinaigrette, divide among the plates and top with the almonds.'

S"For the pancakes: In a small saucepan over high heat, combine the rum, orange juice and raisins, and bring to a simmer. Remove the pan from heat and let sit for 15 minutes. Drain the raisins and reserve the soaking liquid.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, cardamom and nutmeg. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter, orange zest, vanilla and eggs. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the rehydrated raisins. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.Brush a generous coat of clarified butter onto a large cast-iron griddle over medium heat. Add a scant 1/4 cup of the batter to the pan and cook until the bottom is lightly golden brown and bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake, about 3 minutes. Flip the pancake over and continue cooking until the bottom is golden brown. Transfer to a plate. Repeat for the remaining pancakes.For the glaze: Beat the cream cheese, confectioners\\' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Thin out the glaze with some of the raisin soaking liquidit should be just pourable.Serve 3 pancakes per person, drizzle each stack with the glaze and top with warm maple syrup or honey, if desired.

S"Make the banana bread: Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch loaf pan with the softened butter. Place the 5 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan set over medium heat and cook until the butter turns a deep golden brown color, about 2 minutes; stir in the espresso powder. Remove and let cool slightly.Whisk the flour, baking soda and kosher salt together in a medium bowl.Using a potato masher, mash the bananas in a medium bowl until pretty smooth. Add the sugars, cooled brown butter and egg and whisk until combined. Add the flour mixture and whisk until just combined, don\\'t over-mix. Fold in the chopped chocolate.Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake on the lowest oven rack until a toothpick inserted into the center of the banana bread comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 40 to 50 minutes. Let the banana bread cool on a baking rack in the pan for 15 minutes. Use a knife to separate the edges of the banana bread from the pan, then invert it and cool the loaf directly on the rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.Make the espresso-cinnamon butter: Stir the butter, sugar, espresso, cinnamon and salt together in a small bowl until smooth. Serve with the banana bread."

S'For the Lamb: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.  Combine the crumbs, garlic, herbs, olive oil and mustard in a small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place the lamb on a rack in a baking pan.  Season the lamb with salt and pepper to taste.  Spread half of mustard mixture on inside of lamb.  Roll and secure with string.  Sear lamb on all sides and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until lightly golden.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees, remove the lamb and spread the remaining 1/2 of mustard mixture evenly over the top.  Return to the oven and continue roasting until medium rare, about 1 1/4 hours.  Let rest 10 minutes and slice thinly on the bias.For the Bean Ragout: Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots, carrots and celery and sweat for 5 to 7 minutes.  Increase heat to high and add the cooking liquids and chicken stock.  Cook until reduced to 2 cups and strain.  Place the beans and artichokes in the saucepan and add the stock.  Cook until the liquid has reduced to 1/4 cup.  Add the butter, thyme and parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon the mixture onto a platter and top with the pancetta and tomatoes.'

Line a large plate or baking sheet with paper towels, set aside.Whisk together the flour and 1 1/2 cups of the water in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. The mixture should resemble crepe batter, if it is too thick; add more water a few tablespoons at a time, then season with salt and pepper. Season squid and conch with salt and pepper and working in batches, dip 1/3 of the squid in the rice flour batter and allow the excess to drip off then dredge in the cornmeal. Fry until lightly golden brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the paper towel-lined plate. Season immediately with salt. Repeat with the conch, dipping into the batter then frying in batches. Place the greens in a bowl and drizzle with about 1/4 cup of the orange-chipotle vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper. Mound the greens on a platter and place some of the sliced cherry peppers on top. Place the squid and conch around the perimeter of the platter, drizzle all with more of the vinaigrette and garnish with parsley leaves.'

S'Special equipment: a tortilla pressFor the pineapple-pomegranate relish: Combine the pineapple, cilantro, pomegranate, chives and lime juice in a bowl. Add honey if needed. Season the relish with salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.For the pork: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Put the pork into a large bowl and sprinkle with the ancho, New Mexican and arbol chile powders and the salt, tossing to coat evenly.Heat the oil in a large roasting pan or braising pan over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Add the pork and sear until golden brown on all sides. Add the pineapple, garlic and onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock, pineapple juice and pomegranate juice and bring to a boil.Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and put in the oven. Braise until the pork is fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the pork to a bowl and let cool slightly, then coarsely shred with two forks.Mix together the pomegranate molasses, honey and 1/2 cup of the braising liquid in a large saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the shredded pork and toss to coat.For the puffy tacos: Combine the masa mix, salt and 2 1/4 cups warm water in a large bowl and mix until a smooth dough forms. Pull off pieces of dough and roll them into balls about the size of a ping pong ball.Meanwhile, pour 2 inches of oil into a large deep pot and heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F.Cut a quart-size resealable plastic bag open down both sides to form a rectangle. Use the bag to line the tortilla press as you shape the tortillas so they do not stick: Lay one side of the plastic over the bottom of the press. Place a ball of dough in the center and fold the other side of the plastic over the dough. Shut the top and press firmly down on the dough to shape the tortilla. Continue with the remaining dough balls.Drop a tortilla into the hot oil and, using a metal spatula, repeatedly douse the tortilla with the hot oil until it begins to puff up. Flip it over and, using the spatula, make an indentation in the center of the tortilla to form a taco shape. Transfer to paper towels to drain and sprinkle with salt.Fill the puffy taco shells with some of the pork, avocado slices, cheese, pineapple-pomegranate relish, cilantro and radish slices and serve.'

S"For the pickled peaches: Combine the maple syrup and vinegar in a nonreactive medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Stir in the peaches and cook until soft. Remove from the heat and let the peaches sit in the liquid for at least 15 minutes. Remove the peaches with a slotted spoon to a small bowl. Reserve the cooking liquid for the caramel.For the pickled peach bourbon caramel: Cook the reserved pickling liquid over high heat until reduced to about 1/2 cup. Add the maple syrup and butter and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.Remove the pan from the heat, add the bourbon, carefully return the pan to the heat, bring to a boil and cook the alcohol off, about 5 minutes longer.For the cream cheese filling: Whisk together the cream cheese, mascarpone, peach preserves, honey and cinnamon until smooth. Cover and let sit at room temperature while you make the French toast.For the French toast: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Set a baking rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Spread out the bread in a single layer and bake to stale, about 15 minutes. (Alternatively, slice the bread the night before, place on a baking rack set on a baking sheet and let stale on the counter overnight.) Remove the bread and let cool. Increase the heat of the oven to 350 degrees F. Set aside the baking sheet and baking rack.Heat the oil in a small pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels.Whisk together the eggs, yolks, granulated sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and salt in a baking dish until smooth. Whisk in the heavy cream, milk and bourbon until combined.Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat until it begins to shimmer. Dip 4 slices of the bread into the custard mixture and let sit until soaked through, this should take at least 1 minute per side. Remove the slices with a slotted spatula and let the excess custard run off. Place 3 or 4 slices in the pan at a time (depending on how large your pan is) and cook until the bottom of the bread is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip over and continue cooking until the bottom is golden brown and the center is cooked through, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to the prepared baking and place in the oven. Repeat with the remaining butter, oil and bread. Bake the French toast in the oven for 5 minutes.Remove the French toast from the oven and spread the cream cheese filling on 4 of the French toast slices, Top with the remaining 4 slices and transfer to plates. Top with some of the pickled peaches, drizzle with the bourbon caramel and garnish with some of the bacon. Dust with confectioners\\' sugar and garnish with mint sprigs, if desired."

S'Fill a large bowl halfway with ice water and set aside.Bring a medium pot of salted cold water to a boil. Add the yellow and green beans and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until just crisp-tender. Drain and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking. Let sit in the ice water for a few minutes, and then drain well. Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with salted cold water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the potatoes are almost cooked through (a knife or skewer inserted into the center should meet just a little resistance), 8 to 10 minutes. Drain well and let cool slightly.Heat your grill to high.Once cool enough to handle, slice the potatoes lengthwise, brush with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill, cut side down, and cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn over and grill until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Keep the grill on. Combine the cooked beans, grilled potatoes, tomatoes, onion, basil and parsley in a large bowl. Ad the vinaigrette and gently toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the shrimp. To make the spice rub, combine the fennel, mustard and coriander with the salt and pepper in a bowl. Put the shrimp in a large bowl and toss with the spice rub until evenly coated. Add the 1/4 cup olive oil and toss to coat. Place the shrimp on the grates of the grill in an even layer and grill until golden brown and slightly charred, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn the shrimp over and continue grilling until just cooked through, 45 seconds to 1 minute longer.Arrange the salad on 4 large plates and top with the shrimp.'

S'Heat the oil in a medium Dutch oven over high heat. Add the onions and ginger and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the Mesa Curry Mix and cook for 2 minutes.Add the white wine and cook until reduced by half. Add the lobster stock and coconut milk and cook until reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. *Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain into a small saucepan and cook to a sauce consistency. Season with honey, salt and pepper, to taste, and fold in the cilantro. Keep warm.*When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.For Spiny Lobsters:Preheat the grill to high.In a pot fitted with a steamer insert, steam the lobster tails until just beginning to become opaque. Remove the tails from the steamer, brush with the oil and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Place 2 skewers, lengthwise, into each tail so the tails will lie flat on the grill. Grill flesh side down for about 10 minutes or until marked and just cooked through. Serve with the Curry Sauce.'

Drain and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking. Let sit in the ice water for a few minutes, and then drain well. Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with salted cold water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the potatoes are almost cooked through (a knife or skewer inserted into the center should meet just a little resistance), 8 to 10 minutes. Drain well and let cool slightly. Heat your grill to high.Once cool enough to handle, slice the potatoes lengthwise, brush with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill, cut side down, and cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn over and grill until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Keep the grill on. Combine the cooked beans, grilled potatoes, tomatoes, onion, basil and parsley in a large bowl. Ad the vinaigrette and gently toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the shrimp. To make the spice rub, combine the fennel, mustard and coriander with the salt and pepper in a bowl. Put the shrimp in a large bowl and toss with the spice rub until evenly coated. Add the 1/4 cup olive oil and toss to coat. Place the shrimp on the grates of the grill in an even layer and grill until golden brown and slightly charred, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn the shrimp over and continue grilling until just cooked through, 45 seconds to 1 minute longer. Arrange the salad on 4 large plates and top with the shrimp.'

S'Whisk together 3 tablespoons of the oil, orange juice, garlic and oregano in a baking dish, add the pork and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.Heat the grill to high or a nonstick saute pan with a few tablespoons of canola oil over medium-high heat on the stove.Remove the pork from the marinade and place on the grill. Grill until golden brown and slightly charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 150 degrees F, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the grill and let rest 5 minutes before slicing into 1/4-inch thick slices.Reduce the heat of the grill to medium. Place the tortillas on the grill and grill for approximately 10 seconds per side to make pliable. Lay the tortillas on a flat surface. Divide the ingredients evenly over 1 half of each tortilla. Start with 1 slice of the cheese, followed by the ham then a few slices of the pork, a few slices of the jalapenos and another slice of the cheese. Fold the top of the tortilla over the ingredients and press on it. Brush the tops of the tortillas with some of the remaining oil and place on the grill, oil-side down and grill until lightly golden brown, pressing on the tortillas to flatten, 3 to 4 minutes. Brush the tops of the tortillas with oil, flip over and continue grilling, pressing down on the tortillas until golden brown and the cheese has melted.'

Before adding the syrup to the egg whites below, carefully remove the vanilla bean.In the meantime, in a completely clean, dry mixing bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, salt and cream of tartar until creamy and foamy, about 2 minutes. Still whisking, sprinkle in the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and continue to whisk until the whites hold very soft peaks, about 2 minutes. While mixing on slow speed, carefully drizzle in the hot syrup. Turn the mixer to high and whisk until thick, fluffy and just warm, about 7 minutes. Turn the mixer to low and whisk in the reserved vanilla seeds. Scrape the fluff into a bowl.  Wash the bowl and whisk and return them to the machine.Combine the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of the mixer and mix until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low until combined.  Increase the speed and whip until light and fluffy.  Add about 2 cups of Fluff and the vanilla and whip until combined.  Refrigerate for 15 minutes if too soft to use as frosting.'

Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven until smoking. Season the shanks on both sides with salt and pepper and sear until golden brown on both sides, remove to a plate. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat in the pan and add the celery, carrots and onions and cook until caramelized. Add the port and red wine and cook until almost completely reduced. Add the chicken stock, thyme, parsley sprigs and shanks and salt and pepper and bring to a boil on the stove, cover, transfer to the oven and bake for 1 1/2  to 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Remove shanks to a plate and loosely tent with foil to keep warm. Strain the cooking liquid into a medium saucepan and discard the solids Whisk in the roasted garlic and cook over high heat, whisking occasionally, until reduced by half, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove 1 cup of the liquid to use for the orzo and continue reducing the remaining liquid by half again or until thickened to a glaze. Serve the lamb on top of the orzo and drizzle the shanks with the reduced cooking liquid, oven roasted tomatoes and chopped parsley.For the orzo pasta:Heat a medium nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 of the orzo and toast until golden brown. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil and 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat, add the onion and cook until soft. Add the toasted orzo and the remaining orzo and saute for 1 minute to coat the pasta with the oil/onion mixture. Bring 8 cups of water or chicken stock to a boil in a medium pot (or a combination of chicken stock and water) and add hot water/stock to the orzo as if you were making risotto, 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly until the liquid is absorbed and the pasta is al dente (you may not need to use all of the water). Stir in the cold butter and a 1 cup of the braising liquid, chopped parsley and salt and pepper to taste and cook 1 minute longer.For the slow roasted tomatoes:Toss the tomatoes in olive oil, season with salt and pepper and roast in a 200 degree F oven for 6 hours.'

Carefully place a second sheet of the pasta dough on top of the first and press with your fingertips to separate the rows of filling.  Repeat with the remaining dough.  With a ravioli cutter or pastry wheel, cut along straight lines of the vertical and horizontal to form each ravioli square.  Press the edges closed with your fingertips to seal well.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Carefully drop in the ravioli and cook for about 5 minutes.  Drain and serve immediately.For the Green Pea Sauce: Place peas and vegetable stock in a medium saucepan and cook until peas are very soft.  Place mixture in a blender and blend until smooth.  Strain back into the pan and bring to a simmer.  Cook until the mixture has thickened slightly.  Season with coriander, lemon zest, cilantro and salt and pepper to taste. For the Piquillo Pepper-Black Olive Relish: Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and season with pepper.  Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutesTo Assemble: Place 5 ravioli in each bowl.

S'Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until it reaches 360 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. While the oil is heating, put the buttermilk in a large baking dish and season liberally with salt and pepper. Divide the flour between 2 large baking dishes and season both dishes liberally with salt and pepper and cayenne.Working in batches, dredge some of the onion rings in 1 of the dishes of flour and tap off the excess. Dip the rings in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off and then dredge the rings in the second dish of flour making sure to coat the rings evenly. Tap off excess and put into the hot oil. Fry the rings until golden brown and tender, turning once or twice, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the baking sheet lined with paper towels and season with more salt. Repeat with remaining onion rings.'

S'Make the biscuits: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Prick the surface of the potato with a fork, put the potato on a baking sheet and roast until it is soft and a paring knife easily slips into the center, about 1 hour. Cool briefly, then halve and scoop the flesh out from the skin (discard the skin) and into a small bowl. Mash the potato until smooth, then refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour.Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.Whisk together the cold potato puree and the muscovado sugar in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisk in the buttermilk.Whisk together the 2 1/4 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl.  Sprinkle the cubed butter over the dry ingredients, and using your hands or a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles very coarse cornmeal with the largest pieces of butter about the size of a large pea. Stir in the sweet potato mixture and gently mix until a soft dough forms.Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and pat it into a 1-inch-thick round. Using a 2-inch round biscuit cutter, stamp out as many biscuits as you can. Gently press the scraps together and stamp out more biscuits. Place the biscuits about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet, then brush the tops with the cream and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush with the melted butter. Transfer to a bowl or basket and loosely cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm while you make the ham, gravy and eggs.Make the ham steak and red-eye gravy: Heat the oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium heat. Add the ham steak and cook on both sides until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the ham to a cutting board.Add the onion to the drippings in the pan and cook, stirring often, until slightly soft, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar and some salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often for 1 minute. Stir in the flour and cook while stirring constantly for 1 minute. Slowly stir in the coffee, bring the gravy to a simmer, and cook, stirring, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the butter, then remove from the heat, taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Cover to keep warm while you make the eggs.Make the scrambled eggs: Beat the eggs until well combined in a large bowl. Season with some pepper. Melt the butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the eggs and immediately start to stir with a wooden spoon or heatproof rubber spatula to form small curds. Once the eggs are barely set, add some salt and cook, stirring constantly, just until the eggs are set but still very soft and loose. Remove from the heat.Cut the ham into large chunks and divide among 4 plates. Top the ham with a scoop of eggs, gravy and a few cilantro sprigs. Add 2 biscuits to each plate and serve immediately.'

S"Chop the onion into small pieces. Preheat pan or skillet, add 2 teaspoons olive oil to heat, add onions, and begin to saute. While onions are cooking, clean the chanterelles (preferably without water, by using a brush, paring knife, and damp cloth), and cut into small pieces. Keep an eye on the onions, adding 1 ounce of wine as they begin to stick. Clean and chop the pepper, drain, rinse, and chop the olives and peel and chop (or use press) the garlic. After about 1/2 hour of cooking, the onions will be partially caramelized. Add the garlic to the onions, then mix in the chanterelles, with a splash of wine. Stir the mushrooms frequently. They should begin to release their own natural moisture into the pan after a few minutes of cooking. If the liquid builds up more than 1/2 inch in the pan, carefully pour off the excess liquid, reserving it for later use.  Simmer for about 10 minutes, then add the pepper and olives and 1 ounce of marsala. If there\\'s extra chanterelle liquid, add it back at this time. Cover and simmer another 5 minutes. Everything should be tender. Add tamari and sun dried tomato pesto, mix well, and serve over small French bread rounds. Garnish with grated Parmesan."

S'For the tangerine gastrique: Combine the tangerine juice and vinegar in a medium nonreactive saucepan over high heat. Cook until reduced by half. Add the honey and continue cooking until reduced to 2 cups. Stir in the tangerine zest and salt and pepper to taste, and transfer to a bowl to cool. Reserve 1/4 cup for the gravy and use the rest for the turkey.For the turkey a la tangerine: Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 1 hour before roasting. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Brush the entire turkey with oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper and fill with the parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme and half of the carrots, celery and onions.Put 3 cups of the chicken stock in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat.Place the remaining carrots, celery and onions on the bottom of a large roasting pan. Set the turkey on top of the vegetables and roast until lightly golden brown, about 45 minutes.Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue roasting, basting with the warm chicken stock every 15 minutes. When the breasts register 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, begin basting the turkey with some of the gastrique. Continue roasting and basting with the gastrique until the breasts register 160 degrees F, 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours.Remove the turkey from the oven and transfer to a baking sheet, keeping the oven at 350 degrees F. Remove the legs and transfer to a roasting pan. Tent the turkey loosely with foil and let rest 30 minutes before slicing.Strain the pan drippings into a bowl and discard the solids. Add enough stock to make 4 cups liquid. In a pot over medium-high heat, bring the liquid to a simmer. Transfer the simmering liquid to the roasting pan with the legs, cover with foil and braise in the oven until tender, about 1 hour.Remove the legs from the braising liquid and transfer to a baking sheet, reserving the braising liquid for the gravy. Switch the oven to broil. Brush the legs with some of the gastrique and place under the broiler until glazed and crispy, about 8 minutes.For the gravy: In a saucepan, combine the turkey leg braising liquid with enough warm stock to make 7 cups and keep warm over low heat.In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the butter and oil until the oil begins to shimmer. Add the carrots, celery and onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.Whisk in the flour and cook until lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the wine and cook until reduced by two-thirds. Whisk in the hot stock and black peppercorns and cook until thickened. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the flour taste has been cooked out and the gravy coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 8 minutes.Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a clean saucepan, bring to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced. Add the reserved 1/4 cup tangerine gastrique, the orange liqueur and pink peppercorns and cook for an additional minute. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the tangerine zest. Serve the gravy alongside the turkey.'

S'Whisk together the yeast and 1/4 cup of the water in a small bowl and let sit for 5 minutes to proof. Place 1 3/4 cups of the flour in a large bowl with the salt. Add the yeast mixture, the remaining water, and oil and stir until combined. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth. Grease a large bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil, add the dough, and turn to coat. Cover and place in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the grill to high. Once the dough has risen, divide it in half. Divide each half into 2 balls. Roll each ball into an 8-inch circle. Brush with oil and grill on both sides until golden brown. Spread a few tablespoons of the Cilantro Pesto over each pizza, top with a few slices of buffalo mozzarella, and then top with 4 shrimp and cilantro leaves. Place the pizza on the grill until the cheese melts. Serve hot.'

S'Segment the grapefruits: Slice off the top and bottom of each grapefruit, stand the fruit on a cut side and slice away the peel, pith and a sliver of flesh. Working over a bowl and holding the fruit in one hand, run a paring knife between each segment and the membrane to free the segments. Collect the segments in a bowl. Squeeze the membranes over the bowl to remove as much juice as possible, then discard the membranes. Set a strainer over a large liquid measuring cup and dump the segments into the strainer. Reserve 1 cup juice.Whisk the honey and mint into the reserved grapefruit juice. Arrange the grapefruit segments on a platter or in a shallow bowl and drizzle with the dressing.Photograph by Con Poulos'

S'For the fra diavolo mayonnaise: Bring the lobster stock to a boil in a large saute pan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking until very thick and reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes. Remove to a bowl and refrigerate until slightly cool, about 15 minutes.While the stock is reducing, combine the tomatoes and tomato paste in a medium saucepan and cook over high heat until thickened and reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes. Remove to a bowl and refrigerate until slightly cool, about 15 minutes.Heat the olive oil in a small saute pan over medium heat, add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook until soft, about 2 minutes.Combine the mayonnaise and lobster in a medium bowl, add the reduced lobster stock and tomato puree and mix until combined. Use a slotted spoon to remove the garlic and red pepper mixture from the oil and add the oil to the mayonnaise mixture. Add the oregano and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.For the quick-pickled Fresno chiles: Combine the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until the sugar and salt are dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes.Put the chiles in a small heatproof bowl, pour the vinegar mixture over and set the bowl over an ice bath to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.For the basil slaw: Combine the red and green cabbages, basil, onion and lemon zest in a large bowl. Whisk together the lemon juice, Dijon and whole-grain mustards and some salt and pepper in a small bowl. Slowly whisk in the canola oil until emulsified. Pour the dressing over the cabbage and toss well to coat. Cover and let sit at room temperature while you make the fish. (Alternatively, prepare the slaw up to 8 hours in advance, cover and refrigerate.)For the fish: Put the canola oil in a large Dutch oven or deep fryer and heat over low heat until it measures 365 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.Put the flour in a shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper. In a second shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs until smooth and season with salt and pepper. Combine the Panko, plain breadcrumbs and cornmeal in a third shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper.Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge the fillets in the flour and tap off the excess, dredge in the egg mixture and let any excess drip off, then dredge in the breadcrumb mixture and tap off the excess.Fry the fish in batches until golden brown on both sides and just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels and season with salt.To serve: Spread both sides of the rolls with some Fra Diavolo mayonnaise and top with a fish fillet, some coleslaw and pickled Fresnos.'

Add only as many as the pan will comfortably hold at one time. Allow to brown on first side, approximately 2 minutes, and then turn over gently with metal tongs. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, then remove the scaloppine to a warm serving platter. Continue to do the same with all the pieces of geoduck. Set aside and keep warm (without cooking further). Pour off any excess oil from the pan. Add the sake, aji-mirin, garlic, and ginger. Reduce over high heat until reduced by 75 percent, the liquid remaining in pan should become almost syrupy. Add the butter, remove from the heat, and swirl the softened butter into the liquid, forming an emulsion. Add lemon juice and blend thoroughly. Arrange the geoduck attractively and then evenly nap the sauce over the scalloppine. Sprinkle with cilantro and garnish with lemon wedges.'

S'Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat until almost smoking, add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown and dry.  Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft.  Add the wine and cook until reduced.  Add the thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste.For the Potatoes:Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Pour 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter into an iron skillet and heat over high heat.  Arrange potatoes slices in the pan in concentric circles, overlapping the slices, drizzle each layer with butter, season with salt and pepper and spread some of the mushroom duxelle over the entire surface.  Repeat to make 4 to 5 layers.  Heat the pan on top of the stove until the butter bubbles.  Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the potatoes are golden brown and soft, 20 to 25 minutes.  Press the potatoes with a pot lid during the baking once or twice to keep them flat.  Remove from the oven and pour out excess butter.  Let sit 10 minutes before inverting onto a round platter.Yield: 8 servings'

S'Heat a grill to medium. Pull down the husks of the corn and remove the silk from each ear. Fold the husks back into place and tie the ends together with kitchen string. Soak in a large bowl of cold water with 1tablespoon salt, 10 minutes.Remove the corn from the water and shake off the excess. Place on the grill, close the cover and grill, turning, until the kernels are tender, about 12 minutes. Remove from the grill and let cool slightly, then remove the husks; brush the corn with 2 tablespoons canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Increase the grill heat to high; return the corn to the grill and cook, turning, until charred, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut off the kernels: Stand the corn upright on its stem end and cut down the side of the cob with a sharp paring knife.Place the avocados in a medium bowl and mash slightly with a fork. Add the corn kernels, serrano chiles, red onion, lime juice, the remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil, the cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste; gently stir to combine.To keep guacamole from browning, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface and refrigerate until serving.Photograph by Ryan Liebe'

When the pan is hot, place the squab skin-side down into the pan and sear until golden and crispy, about 6 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the squab is medium rare, 1 minute longer. Transfer to a plate to rest.Degrease the pan, leaving a couple tablespoons of fat. Add the shallots to the drippings in the pan and sprinkle with salt, scraping up the drippings with a wooden spoon. Saute the shallots until they begin to soften, 1 minute, and then add the mushrooms and saute until they just start to soften up.Carefully pour in the cognac off the heat, and then return the pan to the heat until the alcohol has completely cooked off and the pan is almost dry. Pour in the marsala and ignite again, allowing the wine to cook until the flame dies down. Add the chicken stock and simmer to reduce the sauce slightly, about 3 minutes.Return the squab to the pan and simmer gently to heat through, 1 minute. Plate 1 leg and breast per plate. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the creme fraiche and butter, whisking until just incorporated. Stir in the parsley and sage. Taste and adjust the seasoning, and then pour the sauce around the squab.'

Remove from the heat and let sit to cool slightly, 5 minutes, then pour over the onions. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.For the hash browns: Mix together the creme fraiche and green onions in a small bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.Grate the potatoes using the large holes on a cheese grater. Heat half of the clarified butter in a 12-inch seasoned cast-iron pan over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook until it is lightly golden brown on both sides and infuses the oil with the flavor of the garlic, then remove and discard.Toss the potatoes with the poppy seeds, salt, sesame seeds and some pepper. Add the potatoes to the pan and stir to coat with butter. Using a spatula, gently press the potatoes into a flat round, slightly smaller than the pan. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the edges are golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.Working carefully with some large, flat spatulas, flip the potato cake. Pour the remaining butter around the edges of the potato cake and continue cooking until potatoes are crisp on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. Let cool for a few minutes. Spread the top with the prepared creme fraiche and scatter the pickled onions over the top. Garnish with parsley leaves and cut into wedges to serve.'

(At this point, you can chill or even freeze the burgers briefly so that they hold their shapes better when cooked.) Brush with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until slightly charred on both sides and cooked to medium doneness, about 8 minutes. Top each burger with 2 slices of cheese, close the cover of the grill and continue cooking for about 30 seconds or until the cheese just melts.

S'For the turkey: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 30 minutes before roasting.Rub the cut side of 2 halves of garlic over the entire turkey, and then put in the cavity. Brush the entire turkey with 4 tablespoons of the butter and sprinkle with the rosemary, salt and pepper (including in the cavity). Put 2 lemon halves into the cavity.Put the shallots, carrots, celery and remaining garlic and lemon halves in the bottom of a roasting pan. Place a roasting rack in the pan and place the turkey on the rack. Add 2 cups of the stock to the bottom of the pan and place in the oven. Put the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and 4 cups stock in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Keep covered and warm.Roast the turkey for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and continue roasting, basting with the warm stock every 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the breast registers 155 degrees F and into the thigh registers 160 degrees F, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove the turkey to a cutting board, loosely tent with foil and let rest at least 20 minutes before carving.Strain the juices into a bowl through a strainer. Let the fat rise to the top of the stock and remove 1/4 cup of the fat. Reserve the fat to make the gravy. Reserve the strained juices for the gravy.For the gravy: Heat the reserved fat in the roasting pan (used to roast the turkey) over high heat over 2 burners. Add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown and the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook until pale golden brown. Whisk in the red and white wine and cook until evaporated. Add the reserved roasting liquid and chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the rosemary sprigs and cook until the gravy thickens, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper.Carve the turkey and serve with the cremini mushroom gravy.'

Place the ears of corn in a large bowl of cold water with 1 tablespoon of salt for 10 minutes. Remove corn from water and shake off excess. Place the corn on the grill, close the cover and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, or until kernels are tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove the husks and eat on the cob or remove the kernels. How to remove corn kernels from cob: To remove kernels from cobs of either raw or cooked corn, stand cob upright on its stem end in a large pan, holding tip with fingers. Cut down the sides of cob with sharp paring knife, releasing kernels without cutting into cob. Run dull edge of knife down the cob to release any remaining corn and liquid.'

Place the trout fillets onto the smoking racks skin-side down, separating them by at least 1/4 inch and put into the smoker. Adjust the heat as needed and cook until the fish is opaque, has darkened in color and has the desired level of smoke flavor, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the skin and bones, flake into large pieces, and place in a bowl.Cut the bottoms off of the creamers so they will sit flat, and scoop out the center flesh of each one.Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, dill, horseradish and onions in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pour some of the dressing over the trout, gently mixing to combine. Add more horseradish and mustard, to taste.Fry the potatoes in batches until they are golden and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel-lined sheet tray and season with salt. Stuff the potatoes with the trout salad, and garnish with dill sprigs and trout roe.'

S'Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the ginger and garlic; cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the mustard seeds; cook 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup water and the lime zest and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and cook 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a blender; blend to a smooth paste, adding more water if needed. Let cool.Rub the ginger paste over the entire chicken, including underneath the skin. Cover the chicken and marinate in the refrigerator, at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking.Combine the cardamom, cinnamon and cloves in a bowl. Cover with cold water and soak at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.Combine the red onion and 1 tablespoon salt in a bowl and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes. Rinse with cold water and drain well. Put the onion in a bowl and add the parsley and sumac.Heat your grill to high for indirect grilling.Drain the spices and add them evenly over the hot coals in a charcoal grill or to the smoker box of a gas grill. Put the lid on the grill and allow smoke to fill the grill, about 10 minutes.Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Put the chicken, skin-side down, on the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat), close the cover and grill until the skin is lightly golden brown with faint grill marks, 22 to 25 minutes. Turn the chicken skin-side up, move to the hotter side of the grill (direct heat) and continue grilling until the skin is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Flip the chicken once more and continue grilling over direct heat until the skin is golden brown and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 8 minutes.Remove the chicken to a cutting board, tent loosely with foil and let rest about 10 minutes before carving. Top the chicken with some of the onion-parsley relish.Photograph by Jennifer Causey'

Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the volume is reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Add the ketchup and cook an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the lime juice, and white pepper. To prepare the burgers: Shape the ground tuna firmly into 4 round uniform patties about 1 1/2inches thick. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. (The burgers must be very cold to hold their shape when cooking) Brush both sides of the burgers lightly with the pineapple glaze and season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Cook the burgers, basting often with the glaze until cooked to desired doneness'

S'Mix sugar, salt, water, and anise flavored liqueur. Pour over salmon halves in a 3-inch deep pan. Marinate, chilled, in the brine mixture for 4 to 8 hours. Remove from brine and pat dry. Brush the salmon with oil. Season with wild fennel pollen, salt, and pepper. Place on Alder plank and soak in cold water overnight. Sometimes a nail through the tail end is used to hold the salmon in place. Lean the plank against an Alder wood fire that has mostly died down to very hot coals. Be careful not to let the plank catch fire. The heat and the smoke from the fire will cook and season the salmon. Serve right off the plank.'

S'For the yogurt: Preheat a cast-iron pan over high heat. Toss the jalapenos in a few tablespoons of canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in an even layer in the pan until soft and skin is blistered. Remove the jalapenos to a bowl, and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap for 15 minutes. Remove the stems and seeds, but do not remove the blistered skin.Combine the jalapenos, cilantro, parsley, pine nuts and garlic in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil through the feed tube until smooth. Add some salt and pepper and pulse a few times just to combine. If the mixture is too thick, add a few more teaspoons of oil and pulse. Transfer to a bowl.Combine the yogurt and feta in a bowl. Gently swirl 1/4 cup of the pesto into the yogurt. Store the remaining pesto in a container with a tight fitting lid and keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. This pesto is great served on grilled chicken or fish.For the tahini: Whisk together the tahini, orange juice, pomegranate molasses and some salt and pepper in a small bowl. Hold at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.For the salad: Combine the olive oil, parsley, capers, tomatoes, cucumber and lemon juice in a bowl. Season the salad with salt and pepper, and hold at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to allow flavors to meld.For the falafel: Drain the chickpeas through a colander then place on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to absorb any excess moisture. Rest the chickpeas on the sheet pan until totally dry, a good 30 minutes, at room temperature.Heat 4 inches of peanut oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 330 degrees F.While the oil is heating, heat the olive oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and chiles, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.Transfer the chickpeas to a food processor, then add the garlic mixture, green onions, cilantro, mint, parsley, lemon juice, baking powder, coriander, cumin and some salt and pepper, and process until the mixture is finely ground, stopping to scrape the bowl every 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to a bowl.Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Using a small ice cream scoop, form the mixture into balls the size of Ping-Pong balls and place on a plate. Fry in batches until they reach a pale blonde color, about 45 seconds, spooning oil over the falafel balls constantly. Remove with a slotted spoon to the prepared baking sheet. Increase the heat of the oil to 350 degrees F. Return the falafel balls to the oil, in batches, cover the pan with a lid for 30 seconds and fry until a deep brown color, spooning the oil over the falafel constantly. Remove with a slotted spoon to the prepared baking sheet, and gently smash and immediately season with salt.Plate 3 smashed falafel balls on top of some tomato salad and drizzle with the tahini for each serving. Serve the yogurt on the side to dip.'

S'For the crepes: In a bowl, whisk dry ingredients together. In a separate bowl, whisk wet ingredients together. Slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet. Chill for 1 hour. Strain, if necessary. Add enough batter to a hot pan to thinly coat the bottom of the pan.  Cook crepe for a minute or so or until the bottom of the crepe edges start to curl.  Flip over and cook for about 30 seconds.  Remove each crepe and stack on a plate.  Set aside until ready to fill.For the Strawberry Zinfandel syrup:Add all ingredients into a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Boil until reduced about 3/4 of the way. Strain and then continue to reduce to a medium syrup.For the rhubarb syrup:Place the ingredients into a large pot, cover with water and bring to a boil.  Boil until reduced about 3/4.  Strain and then continue to reduce to a heavy syrup. For the rhubarb butter:Place ingredients into a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle and cream until homogenous. This can alternately be done with a hand mixer.For the sauteed strawberries:Saute strawberries in a small amount of rhubarb butter until slightly soft. Add vanilla sugar. Deglaze with raspberry vinegar. Spread on sheet pan to cool.  Fill crepes with some of the strawberry mixture and a little more rhubarb butter.  Fold into quarters and place on sizzle platter, 3 at a time, dotted with a small amount of rhubarb butter.For service:Lay 1 crepe browned side down and smear with a bit of rhubarb butter. Spoon some of the sauteed strawberries down the center and fold the crepe over so it overlaps slightly. Sprinkle with some of the vanilla sugar and brown with a torch. Drizzle some of the Zinfandel syrup over, and sprinkle with pink peppercorns and strawberries. Serve with ice cream, if desired.'

S"Heat the cream in a small saucepan over low heat.Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over high heat and cook, without stirring, until amber brown, about 8 minutes. Slowly whisk in the warm cream, blackberry puree and liqueur and cook until smooth and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract.  Let come to room temperature.French Toast:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Put a baking sheet in the oven.Whisk together the eggs, sugar and salt in a large baking dish until smooth.  Add the pumpkin puree, ground spices, milk, 1/4 cup of the heavy cream, vanilla and rum and whisk until smooth.Put 4 slices of the bread in the custard mixture and let sit for 2 minutes.  Carefully turn over the slices and let sit until the bread is completely soaked through, about 2 more minutes.While the bread is soaking, heat 3 tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat until the mixture begins to sizzle. Cook the 4 slices of the bread until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip over and continue cooking until the bottom is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer.  Remove to the baking sheet in the oven to keep warm.  Wipe out the pan with paper towels and repeat the process with the butter, oil and remaining 4 pieces of bread.Combine the mascarpone and remaining 1/4 cup of heavy cream in a bowl and using a stand mixer or hand-held mixer, beat until fluffy and smooth.  Scrape the mixture into a bowl and fold in a few tablespoons of the blackberry-caramel sauce.   Put the sauce into a small saucepan over low heat and heat or put it in the microwave for a minute or so to just warm through.Remove the French toast from the oven and arrange them on a serving platter. Top 4 slices of the toast with a large dollop of the blackberry-caramel mascarpone and some of the blackberries. Cover with the remaining 4 pieces of toast and drizzle each with some of the warm blackberry caramel sauce. Sprinkle with confectioners\\' sugar, garnish with fresh mint sprig and serve."

S'Cut the pineapple in small dice and place in colander. Set aside and let the juice drain, reserving the juice. Julienne the orange zest and place in a small pot and cover with water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Strain and reserve the zest and the orange flavored water. Using the same small pot, combine the reserved pineapple juice, 1 tablespoon sugar, and orange zest. Scrape the vanilla bean seeds into it the pot as well. Bring to a simmer. Place the pineapple in a bowl and pour over the juice. Let it sit for 2 hours or overnight.Combine the lime zest, 3 tablespoons sugar, cream cheese, and rum in a medium bowl and whip until smooth. Reserve. This can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance.To build the sandwiches, cut each brioche slice in 1/2 and brush with butter on one side. Sprinkle with some of the remaining 1/4-cup sugar and turn over so the non-buttered side is faced up. Spread a 1/4-inch layer of the cream cheese spread on all slices. Put a layer of bananas on 1/2 the slices and place the other slice of brioche on top, forming a sandwich.Lightly butter and sugar the aluminum sheets and place a sandwich on each. Fold up and reserve.  Place the sandwiches over a medium low heated grill and cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until the sandwich gets nicely toasted on both sides. Remove from grill. These can either be unwrapped and platted or the aluminum can be opened and the pineapple salsa spooned right on top.'

S"For the crepes: Whisk together the sugar and eggs until pale, and then whisk in the milk until combined. Mix in the flour and salt until smooth. Whisk in the butter, cover and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.For the ricotta filling: Whisk together the ricotta, sugar and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.For the apple mixture: Combine the orange juice, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, allspice, cloves, apples and salt in a large saute pan over high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are softened and the juices have thickened. Remove and let cool slightly.For cooking crepes: Place a 6-inch nonstick pan over medium heat and spray with nonstick spray or brush with butter. Once the pan is sizzling, slowly pour in enough batter to thinly cover the entire bottom, using a ladle. Quickly tilt and rotate the pan and cook until the bottom of the crepe is lightly browned, 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds. Flip the crepe, using your fingers or a spatula, and cook 30 seconds longer. Slide the crepe onto a wax-paper-lined plate, and then repeat with the rest of the batter.For the orange sauce and brown butter: Heat the orange juice in a small saute pan over medium heat and let reduce to a syrupy consistency. Cook the butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat until it begins to turn a nutty brown color. Remove from the heat and whisk in the zest and salt. Reserve.Lay the crepes on a flat surface. Spoon some of the ricotta down the center of each crepe and roll. Plate 2 crepes each on large plates and top with some of the apple mixture, orange sauce and brown butter. Dust with confectioners\\' sugar and garnish with fresh mint leaves."

S'Build a fire and let it burn down to glowing embers.Meanwhile, crush the garlic, fennel and black pepper in a mortar to a rough paste. Chop the herbs finely and combine with the garlic and just enough olive oil to make a paste. With the tip of a knife prick a few holes in the surface of the steak and the fatty layer. Rub the marinade on the surface of the beef, pushing into the holes. Set aside to bring to room temperature. Simmer the potatoes in the water and chicken stock with the bouquet garni until cooked through and almost falling apart. Drain and reserve the liquid. Cook the steak over the coals 4 minutes per side for medium. About 2 minutes before the steak is finished cooking, place the herb branches on the coals. Remove steak from the heat and let rest for 2 minutes. Slice and serve with the salad. Be sure to pour any juices that were released from the steak while resting back over it. Bring the cheese to room temperature and crumble into the salad bowl. Add the olives, potatoes, a little of the potato liquid, vinegar, olive oil and dandelion. Season with salt and fresh pepper and toss gently to combine.'

Add the chorizo and cook until lightly golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon and pour out all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat. (The amount of fat will vary depending on the chorizo that is used. If your chorizo does not render at least 2 tablespoons fat, add some olive oil.)Add the garlic, carrot, celery and onion to the fat in the pan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until soft, 8 to 9 minutes. Add the kale and cook until slightly wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the stock, wine and 2 teaspoons salt; cover and bring to a boil.Add the cranberry beans and cooked chorizo to the saucepan; lower the heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the beans and kale are soft, about 1 1/2 hours.

Let it sit at room temperature to allow the flavors to meld.Meanwhile, prepare the turkey: Remove the neck and giblets, then rinse the bird inside and out with cold water and pat dry. Rub the entire surface of the bird with the butter and season well (including inside the cavity) with salt and pepper. Truss the turkey with kitchen twine and place it breast-side up on a rack in a large roasting pan. Roast until slightly golden brown, about 45 minutes.Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue roasting 1 more hour, basting with the chicken stock every 15 minutes. Brush the entire turkey with 1 cup of the pomegranate glaze and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 160 degrees F, about 15 more minutes.Remove the turkey from the oven and brush with the remaining glaze. Tent loosely with foil and let sit 15 minutes before carving.Photograph by Kana Okada'

S'Blending Hot Liquids: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid; that prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times, then process on high speed until smooth.'

S'To prepare the ketchup:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the tomatoes in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and place on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until soft.Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor and process until smooth. Strain the tomatoes, pressing against the solids with a wooden spoon to extract as much pulp and juice as possible.Heat the remaining olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat and saute the onions and garlic until translucent. Add the tomato puree and remaining ingredients and continue cooking, uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally until thick.To prepare the burgers:  Shape the meat firmly into 4 round uniform patties about 1 1/2-inches thick. Brush both sides of the burgers lightly with the remaining olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Cook the burgers until done to your preference, 5 to 6 minutes on each side for medium rare etc.'
