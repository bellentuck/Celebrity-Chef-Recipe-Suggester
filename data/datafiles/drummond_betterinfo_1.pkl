S'For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Using a hand or stand mixer, cream the butter and granulated sugar until combined. Add the egg yolks and mix until combined. Add the lemon and lime zest. Add the flour and mix until just combined. Next, add the citrus juice (your choice) and coconut extract and mix the dough until it comes together.Scoop out tablespoons of dough, roll into balls between your hands and place on a baking sheet. Bake until not quite starting to turn brown, 12 to 13 minutes. Remove from the oven but keep the cookies on the baking sheet for 3 to 4 minutes. Use a spatula to move them to a cooling rack to cool completely.For the icing: Add the powdered sugar, cream of coconut, lemon and lime zest, milk, coconut extract, salt, egg white and lemon and lime juice to a large bowl. Whisk thoroughly until combined, adding either more powdered sugar or more juice until it reaches a pourable but still thick consistency.Drizzle the icing across the cookies in several lines, and then repeat in the other direction. Sprinkle the cookies with extra zest before the icing sets.'

S"Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Pour 3 tablespoons of the oil in a skillet and heat to medium. Add the hash browns and leave them undisturbed for a few minutes. Make sure the skillet\\'s not too hot. Ideally you\\'ll turn them only once and then cook them on the other side--you want them crispy and golden. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.In another skillet, add about an inch of oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. Fry the potato wedges until golden brown and crisp. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. (You can also bake these in the oven if you prefer.) Drain the hash browns and potato wedges on a paper towel and keep warm.Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet until melted. Throw in the ham, jalapenos if using, onions and bell peppers and toss them around for several seconds. Turn off the heat and set the pan aside.In 8 individual skillets (or 1 very large one) layer: the hash browns, the veggie/ ham mixture and then the grated cheese. Bake for a minute or 2, until the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven with an oven mitt, as the skillets will be hot.Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a nonstick skillet and fry the first 4 eggs, then remove and set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and fry the remaining 4 eggs.Place the potato wedges over the top of the melted cheese, then top with 1 egg per skillet. Spoon the salsa over the top and serve immediately. Enjoy!"

S'Pour the contents of the giblet bags into a large saucepan. Cover with water and boil until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside. Remove the giblets from the pan, allow them to cool, and then chop up the gizzards and liver. Pick the meat from the neck. Discard the bones.Pour all the turkey drippings out of the roasting pan into a separate container. Allow grease to separate from the juices. Ladle out the fat into another bowl.Place the roasting pan over 2 burners over medium heat (there should be lots of yummy brown bits in the pan). Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of the fat back into the pan. Whisk it around to evenly distribute it throughout the pan. Sprinkle 5 to 6 tablespoons of flour over the grease and whisk to combine it with the fat, loosening the bits from the bottom of the pan a little in the process. Cook the roux until it becomes a deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.Pour in the chicken broth, whisking constantly. Add 2 to 4 cups, depending on your need. Cook the gravy, whisking gently, until the mixture begins to thicken. Pour in a little bit of the turkey drippings, but be aware that because the brine is so salty, these drippings are very salty. Keep cooking the gravy until thick, adding in chopped giblets, to taste, as well as plenty of black pepper. Use the giblet water from the saucepan to thin the gravy if it gets too thick.Serve when very thick and flavorful.'

Move them around in the skillet a bit to make sure they don\\'t burn. When they\\'re deep golden brown on the bottom, flip them to the other side and let them cook for another 2 minutes or so. Remove from the pan and cook the rest of the croissant halves.Serve a top and bottom piece together with butter, warm blackberry syrup and maple syrup, strawberries and whipped cream."

Grab a handful of onions, throw into the flour mixture, tap to shake off excess and plunge into the hot oil. Fry for a few minutes and remove to a paper-towel-lined plate as soon as they are golden brown. Repeat until onions are gone.Grill (or saute) the steak over medium-high heat until medium-rare, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the heat and allow to rest. Slice the steak against the grain in thin slices.For the salad: In a large bowl, add the lettuce mix, blue cheese and tomatoes. Add a little of the remaining dressing/marinade and toss to combine. Add more if needed.Heap the salad on a plate, making sure to get plenty of blue cheese and tomatoes on each plate.

Sprinkle on half of the Parmesan, toss, sprinkle on more and toss again. Bake, tossing again halfway through, until crisp and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.For the salad: Throw the green leaf and romaine lettuce into a bowl. Add some dressing, and give it a good initial toss, just so you can evaluate how much more dressing you need. Add more dressing to taste. Add the cooled croutons. Toss gently and serve.'

Bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly, and cook until the strawberries are very soft, a good 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and use a potato masher to completely smush them to smithereens. Pour the mixture into a fine-mesh strainer placed over a bowl. Use a spoon to stir the fruit so the liquid is forced through. Continue until almost all of the liquid is in the bowl. Set the pulp aside.Skim as much foam off the sauce as you can. Pour the skimmed sauce back into the same saucepan, add 1/4 cup of the pulp back in and boil again for 3 minutes over medium-high heat. Skim off any more foam that has formed on the surface, then allow the sauce to cool slightly before pouring it into a pitcher or jar. Refrigerate it to thicken and serve it cold.'

Scoop out 1-tablespoon portions and roll them into balls with your hands. Place the meatballs onto parchment-lined baking sheets and put the baking sheets in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes for the meatballs to firm up.To brown the meatballs, heat the olive oil in a heavy pot or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook, turning the meatballs to make sure they brown all over, 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.Freezer instructions: Put the cooked meatballs in a single layer on baking sheets and put into the freezer. When frozen, divide them into freezer bags, 25 per bag, and return them to the freezer. Yield: 125 meatballs.'

Put the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until fork-tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.Slice the baked potatoes in half lengthwise, then scrape out the inner flesh with a cookie scoop or spoon, leaving a small margin of potato in the skins. Brush both sides of the potato skins with vegetable oil. Salt both sides liberally. Place the skins cut-side down on the baking sheet and return to the oven. Bake for 7 minutes, then flip the skins to the other side. Bake until the skins are crispy, about 7 minutes more.Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a skillet until crisp, then remove to a paper towel-lined plate to cool.When ready to serve, chop the bacon into bits and transfer to a small bowl. Put the cheese, ham, salsa, sour cream, ranch and chives in separate bowls. Lay out the fixings, put the skins on a platter and have everyone help themselves at the skins bar.'

S"Place the chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl with the vegetable shortening. Throw it in the microwave until the shortening is melted and hot, 30 to 45 seconds. Stir with a fork to combine thoroughly.Next, pour the melted chocolate over the underside of a clean cookie sheet. Then, with an offset spatula or a knife, spread the chocolate in a thin layer. Keep going until it\\'s very, very thin. Then...and this is the key...stick it in the freezer for a few minutes.After a few minutes, check that the chocolate is ready by pressing it with your finger tip; it should leave the slightest mark, but not an actual depression.Next, get a somewhat sharp-edged spatula and begin to scrape the chocolate from the bottom of the pan. When the chocolate is just the right temperature, it\\'ll curl instead of break. If it gets too soft, stick it back in the freezer for a minute.Pretty soon you\\'ll have a bunch of fun little chocolate curls.Important: As soon as possible, transfer the curls to a cold pan or plate, and then stick them in the freezer to harden. Store in the freezer in a zip-top bag until you need them. Use them to adorn pies, cakes or platters of fruit. You\\'ll feel instantly fancy!"

S'Propane Gas Torch Safety: Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat, open flame, and prolonged exposure to sunlight. They should only be used in well-ventilated areas. When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you. Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve. Light the gas jet, and blow out the match. Always turn off the burner valve to "finger tight" when finished using the torch. Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision.'

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners.Place the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt into a sifter or fine-mesh strainer, then sift the mixture into a large bowl until it\\'s all combined. Throw the butter pieces into the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients.Measure the cream in a spouted measuring cup and crack in an egg. Zest one of the lemons and add the zest to the cream. Add half of the rosemary to the mixture. Whisk together, then drizzle it into the flour-butter mixture, stirring gently with a fork until combined and a dough forms.Turn the dough onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle. Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. The final rectangle should be about 18 inches by about 10 inches.Use a knife to trim the dough into a symmetrical rectangle, then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical square/rectangular pieces. Next, cut each piece in half diagonally to form smaller triangles. Transfer the triangles to the prepared baking sheets. Bake until just barely golden brown, about 18 minutes, then allow to cool completely.While the scones are cooling, make the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar and milk in a large bowl. Add the juice of the lemon you zested and whisk the mixture together. Zest the second lemon and add the zest to the bowl. Add the rest of the rosemary and whisk it until it\\'s all combined. Add a little extra milk if it needs thinning.Position a cooling rack over a baking sheet. When the scones are completely cooled, drop them one by one into the glaze. Flip them over to coat. Transfer them to the cooling rack to allow the excess glaze to drip off. Allow the glaze to set completely before serving.The scones will last for several days in an airtight container."

Add the milk and mix.Sift the flour, baking powder and salt, and then blend into the sugar mixture.Divide the dough in half, slightly flatten between two sheets of waxed paper and refrigerate, about 1 hour (or freeze for 20 minutes).For the egg yolk glaze: While dough is chilling, separate the eggs, reserving the whites and placing each yolk into an individual small bowl. Add 4 teaspoons water and different food coloring to each yolk and combine to make the egg yolk glaze.Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. Carefully cut around hands using a dull knife.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Transfer the hand cookies to a lightly greased cookie sheet and paint the cookies (with a soft brush) with the egg yolk glazes. Bake the cookies, about 6 minutes. Do not allow the cookies to brown. Transfer the cookies from the oven to a wire rack to cool.While the cookies are cooling, make the frosting: Simply combine the powdered sugar, butter, heavy cream and vanilla in a food mixer until light and fluffy. If you like you can put the frosting in disposable piping bags to make decorating easier. Decorate the cookies with the frosting and any edible decorations, jewels, disco dust, sanding sugar you like.'

S"Move the oven rack to the bottom and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F, then start with the seasoning: Grab the peppercorns and throw them in a big plastic bag and pound them with a rolling pin to break them open. Pull the leaves off the rosemary and thyme sprigs. Throw the crushed peppercorns into a bowl with the salt and herb leaves and add the minced garlic. Use your fingers to toss it all together, then set it aside.Place the beef, fat-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Drizzle the olive oil all over the surface and rub it in with your hands. Sprinkle the peppercorn-herb-salt mixture all over the surface of the beef, pressing it lightly with your hands.Roast the beef 45 minutes for the first stage. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and insert a meat thermometer sideways into the roast. Roast the beef an additional 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the thermometer registers 120 degrees F to 135 degrees F in the center for medium rare. (The meat will continue to cook for a bit after you remove it from the oven.)Remove the beef from the rack and let it rest about 15 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. When you\\'re ready to serve, carve it into slices of your preferred width.Serve with Yorkshire puddingPhotograph by Con Poulos"

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt.Cut the cold butter into small pieces. Cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles crumbs.Now finely chop the pecans and stir them into the flour mixture. Mix the egg and cream together. Add the mixture to the bowl and stir until just combined.Turn the mixture onto a cutting board. The dough will be very crumbly, but do not let your heart be troubled. With your hands, push the mixture together into a large ball. Do not knead or press too much; you want to leave that gluten alone!With a rolling pin, very gently roll out the dough into a 10-inch round, about 3/4 inch thick. With a sharp knife, cut the round into 8 equal-size wedges.Transfer the wedges to a baking sheet lined with a Silpat baking mat. (Or just spray the pan with cooking spray; either one will work!) Bake the scones for 22 to 26 minutes, until they\\'re just barely starting to brown. Do not allow the edges to become dark or the Red Coats will come and get you. Allow the scones to cool completely before icing.In a medium mixing bowl, stir the icing ingredients until smooth. Pour generously over the scones and sprinkle with pecans. Allow the icing to set before serving.Photograph by Coral Von Zumwalt"

Add the eggs and beat until light and fluffy. Add the milk and mix. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Blend the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture. Divide the dough in half, flatten into discs and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour or freeze for 20 minutes.Roll out the 2 pieces of dough and put each one on a baking sheet. Bake until the cookie dough is cooked and golden brown but not overly crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool completely.For the topping: Using a mixer with a whisk attachment, whip together the cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and lemon zest in a medium bowl until light and fluffy.For the apple jelly glaze: Mix the apple jelly and 3 tablespoons water together in a bowl.For the grilled fruit: Heat a grill pan to medium-high heat and oil with the coconut oil. Thread the strawberries, kiwi, peaches and pineapple slices separately onto skewers (there should be about 2 skewers per type of fruit) and lay them onto a plate. Brush with the apple jelly glaze. Turn the skewers over and brush the other side with more glaze.Grill the fruit, turning once, until grill marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the fruit from the skewers, placing each type of fruit into individual bowls.Serve the cooled crusts with the cream cheese topping, bowls of grilled fruit and the remaining apple jelly glaze. Let everyone build their own pizza by spreading the cream mixture on the crust and decorating with as much fruit as desired, finishing with a final brushing of the apple jelly mixture for gloss!'

S"To make the meatballs, add the ground beef, grated Parmesan, 3 tablespoons of the parsley, the lemon juice, ground oregano, garlic, egg, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper to a bowl and mix together well. Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls.In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs in batches, turning to brown all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. No need to cook them all the way as they\\'ll go back into the soup later. Remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside.Now, grab some beef stock and pour it into a pot. Add some salt and pepper. Stir in the tomato paste--it adds so much yummy richness. Make a bouquet garni by adding the peppercorns, bay leaves and remaining 1/4 cup parsley to a piece of cheesecloth and tying it into a bundle using kitchen twine; drop it right into the soup. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 30 minutes.Remove the bouquet garni, which now resembles a jellyfish with jaundice. Go ahead and discard it; it\\'s lived a full life. Add the diced potatoes, carrots, celery and onions and the sliced cabbage. Finally, in go the browned meatballs. Let the soup simmer long enough for the vegetables to get slightly tender and the meatballs to cook all the way through, another 20 minutes or so.You can sprinkle the soup with some freshly grated Parmesan if you\\'d like one last dose of decadence. Serve with crusty bread."

Remove from the heat and set aside.Grill the tomato slices on a grill pan or simply sear them in a hot skillet. Remove and set aside.Bring a medium saucepan of water to a gentle boil. Add the vinegar. Use a wooden spoon to carefully stir the water into a circular "whirlpool." Crack the eggs into the water and allow them to swirl around in the water until they begin to set. Let them stay in the water for 1 minute, then remove them with a slotted spoon and set on a plate. If the eggs need to be cooked longer, just add them back to the water for 30 seconds at a time.Spoon the vegetables on a plate or in a bowl and set the eggs on top. Lay the tomato slices on the side. Place the cheese slice on the side. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper and serve!'

Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.For the spice mixture: Heat the oil in a skillet, then add the oregano, cumin, coriander and chile powder and fry until the color deepens (do not let it brown), 30 seconds to a minute. Divide the spice mixture between the pots of beans, along with the salt (3 tablespoons salt in each pot) and stir together. Cover and continue simmering until the liquid level is to your liking, about another hour. Taste for seasoning and add more of what it needs.'

Bring to a simmer and when the mixture is hot (but not boiling), turn off the heat and allow to cool to warmer than lukewarm, 30 to 45 minutes.Stage 2: Sprinkle in the yeast and add 8 cups of flour. Stir to combine, then cover and allow to rise for 1 hour.Stage 3: After 1 hour, add the salt, baking powder, baking soda and remaining 1 cup flour and stir to combine. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes, then form into a ball, cover with a towel and allow to rise in a warm place for 30 to 45 minutes.Stage 4: Melt 2 sticks butter in a saucepan.Roll out the dough to 1/2 inch thick. Cut circles with a 2 1/2-inch cutter. Dunk each circle in the melted butter, then immediately fold in half and place on a baking sheet. Press lightly to encourage sealing. Cover with a towel and allow the rolls to rise 30 to 45 minutes.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Stage 5: To parbake the rolls before freezing, bake until the rolls are risen and set but not brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Freeze the rolls separately, then store them in batches in freezer bags. (If you\\'re not freezing the rolls and want to serve them right away, bake at 400 degrees F until risen, set and golden brown, about 15 minutes total.)When ready to cook and serve the frozen rolls, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the remaining stick of butter in a saucepan.Place the frozen rolls on baking sheets and brush them with the melted butter. Bake until golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes. Brush them with additional melted butter if you like and let them sit for 1 minute. Serve while still warm."

S"To make the dough, combine the milk and canola oil in a large pot. Add the sugar and stir. Scald the mixture by heating it almost to a boil. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool until it\\'s warm but not too warm.Add 8 cups of the flour along with the yeast and stir it around until combined--it will be super sticky! Cover the mixture with the lid of the pot or a dishtowel, and let it sit for an hour or so until it has risen.Sprinkle in the remaining cup of flour, the baking power, baking soda and salt and stir gently to combine. It takes a while to get it stirred together.To make the rolls, drizzle a small amount of butter into 36 muffins cups (3 trays). Pinch off a small amount of the dough and roll into a neat ball. As you roll, place in groups of 3 in each muffin cup. Continue with the rest of the dough.Set the pans in a draft-free, slightly warm place, cover with a lightweight dish towel and allow the rolls to rise until light and puffy, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Bake until deep golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Serve piping hot."

S"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and butter a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.Place the prunes in a small saucepan. Cover them with water. Bring to a low boil and cook until soft and mashable, about 8 minutes.Drain the water and mash the prunes on a plate. It\\'s okay to leave little chunks behind. Set the prunes aside and make the cake.Sift together the flour, baking soda, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Mmmm... smells like the holidays.In a separate bowl, mix together the oil, sugar, vanilla and eggs.Combine the wet and dry ingredients and splash in the buttermilk. Stir until just combined. The mixture will be slightly lumpy.Now throw in the mashed prunes. And if your honey walks in as you\\'re completing this step, shield the bowl with your body and stir quickly. What he doesn\\'t know won\\'t hurt him.Pour into the prepared baking pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Grandma Iny was adamant: do not over bake the cake. You want it to be nice and moist.When the cake has about 5 minutes left to bake, make the icing: Combine the sugar, buttermilk, butter, corn syrup, baking soda and vanilla in a medium saucepan. Stir to combine. Bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat. No need to stir. Continue boiling until the icing turns a light caramel color, 5 to 7 minutes. Important: The icing should be the color of caramel, but not yet firm and sticky. It needs to be pourable.Pull the cake out of the oven. Try not to faint, as it smells absolutely divine.While the cake is very warm, pour the icing evenly over the top. Work fast, as it will quickly start to soak into the cake.Spread the coat evenly... then please, do yourself a favor: lick the spatula. It\\'ll make you smile. Serve immediately, or feel free to let the cake sit on the counter for a while before serving. It only gets better with age.Helpful hint: serve without revealing the fact that the cake contains prunes."

S'The day before making the stuffing, bake the cornbread: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Melt 2 tablespoons shortening in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Meanwhile, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, milk and egg until combined. Slowly incorporate the wet ingredients into the dry, stirring until combined. Melt the remaining 1/4 cup shortening in the microwave and add to the batter, stirring constantly. Pour the batter into the hot skillet, smoothing the surface with a rubber spatula. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the cornbread cool in the skillet, then cut into 1-inch cubes.Spread the cornbread and French bread cubes on 2 baking sheets and let dry at room temperature, uncovered, until totally crisp, about 24 hours. Transfer to a large bowl and toss to mix them up a bit.Make the stuffing: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the celery, carrots and onion and cook until the onion is almost translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and add the rosemary, thyme, sage and turmeric. Gradually ladle the broth mixture into the bowl with the bread, tossing gently. Taste as you go and add salt carefully. If the mixture is not moist enough, add a bit more chicken broth. Stir in the parsley.Transfer the mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.Photograph by Linda Pugliese'

Cook over low heat until the blackberries are broken down and syrupy, about 20 minutes.Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, using a whisk or spoon to force as much of the deep purple liquid through as you can; set aside to cool. Discard the blackberry pulp and seeds.Heat the half-and-half and the remaining 1 cup sugar in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks in a bowl until pale yellow and thick. Temper the egg yolks by splashing in a very small amount of the warm half-and-half mixture while whisking constantly. Slowly pour the tempered yolks into the saucepan with the half-and-half and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.Stir the heavy cream into the bowl with the berry mixture, then pour in the egg mixture and stir to combine.

S'For the pumpkin gingersnap cheesecake: In a food processor or blender, grind the gingersnaps until fine. Pour into a bowl and stir in the pecans, melted butter, brown sugar and salt. Press into the bottom and sides of a 10-inch springform pan and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To make the filling, beat the cream cheese in a stand mixer until soft, scraping the sides once. Mix in the pumpkin, scraping the sides once or twice. Add the eggs 1 at a time, allowing them to mix in, then add the sour cream and mix. With the mixer on low, add the granulated sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg. Thoroughly scrape the bowl and mix to ensure everything is smooth and mixed in.Pour the filling into the pan, smoothing the top. Set the pan on a baking sheet and bake until the filling is no longer soupy but still slightly jiggly, about 50 minutes. Turn off the oven, open the door just a hair and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for 15 more minutes. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool for 30 minutes, then cover it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge to chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.For the salted caramel sauce: Mix the brown sugar, heavy cream, butter, vanilla and salt in a medium saucepan over medium-low to medium heat. Cook, while whisking gently, until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool, then refrigerate until needed. Serve warm or at room temperature.Slice the cheesecake and top with the salted caramel sauce, whipped cream and chopped pecans.'

S'Prepare a grill for medium heat.Split the yellow squash and zucchini lengthwise down the middle. Brush them and the corn with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and grill until the veggies are somewhat soft and have nice grill marks.

S'For the vegetables: Warm the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until starting to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the squash and zucchini, sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.Grill the tomato slices on a grill pan or simply sear them in a hot skillet. Remove and set aside.For the hollandaise sauce: In a small saucepan, melt the butter until sizzling.Put the egg yolks in a blender. Turn the blender on low to allow the yolks to combine, and then begin pouring the very hot butter in a thin stream into the blender. The blender should remain on the whole time, and you should be careful to pour in the butter very slowly. Keep pouring the butter until it\\\'s all gone, then immediately begin pouring the lemon juice into the blender. Check the blender to make sure the sauce is still liquid and moving easily through the blades; if it\\\'s not, add a little more juice and give it a stir, then blend again. Add a generous shake of cayenne pepper. If the sauce is too thick, continue to blend while adding more lemon juice.For the poached eggs: Bring a medium saucepan of water to a gentle boil. Add the vinegar. Use a wooden spoon to carefully stir the water into a circular "whirlpool." Crack the eggs into the water and allow them to swirl around in the water until they begin to set. Let them stay in the water for 1 minute, then remove them with a slotted spoon and set on a plate. If the eggs need to be cooked longer, just add them back to the water for 30 seconds at a time.Spoon the vegetables on plates or in bowls and set the eggs on top. Lay the tomato slices on the side. Place the cheese slices on the side. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper and serve with the hollandaise sauce poured over the top.'

Add the butter to the bowl and use a fork or pastry blender to cut it into the flour mixture. The mixture should resemble a moist, coarse meal. Add the slivered almonds and combine thoroughly.Place the still-frozen cherries in a bowl, add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, cornstarch and almond extract and gently stir the cherries to combine.Divide the cherries between 8 ramekins (about 1/2 cup each). Top with the crumb mixture, evening out the surface.Bake until the topping is crisp and golden brown, about 45 minutes. If the topping appears underdone, continue baking in 10 minute increments until it\\'s done.To serve: Add the heavy cream and granulated sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip. Keep in the fridge until ready to serve.Serve the individual crisps warm or at room temperature with a dollop of freshly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.Note: To ensure the best results, this recipe has been altered and differs from what appears in the episode."

S'Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.For the seasoning: Combine the garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, salt and cayenne.For the surf and turf: Rub 1 tablespoon of the butter over the tenderloin then sprinkle lightly with the Cajun seasoning. Place in the oven for approximately 25 to 30 minutes.After about 25 minutes check the tenderloin; you want a temperature of 120 to 125 degrees F on a meat thermometer for medium rare to rare. Remove the tenderloin from the oven and rest it for 10 to 15 minutes.In another skillet, add 3 tablespoons of the butter and heat to melt. Throw in the onions, green peppers and red peppers, then cook until golden brown and colored, but still somewhat crisp, a couple of minutes. Add the garlic and cook around for 30 to 45 seconds. Remove the veggies to a plate.Heat the same skillet over high heat, and then pour in the wine and chicken broth. Cook on high for 3 to 5 minutes, scraping the bottom of the skillet to deglaze. Reduce the heat to medium-low heat and pour in the cream, stirring or whisking constantly. Cook the sauce until the cream starts to thicken the mixture, a few minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.Add the cooked vegetables to the sauce, making sure to include all the juices that have drained onto the plate. Stir and cook until the mixture is bubbly and hot, 1 to 2 minutes.Next add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to a skillet and melt the butter over high heat. Throw the shrimp into the skillet and sprinkle them lightly with some of the remaining Cajun seasoning. Cook the shrimp until opaque and deep golden brown with some dark brown parts. Remove from the skillet and set aside.Serve the veggies and shrimp in their skillets and the tenderloin on a platter.'

S'For the cookies: Cream the butter with the powdered sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to combine. Add the flour, cocoa powder and salt, and mix together until the dough comes together. Place plastic wrap on the surface of the dough and refrigerate for 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line baking sheets with baking mats or parchment.Roll out the cookie dough and cut out the cookies using a rectangular cookie cutter, re-rolling the scraps in order to use as much of the dough as possible. Place the cookies onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes, in batches if necessary, being careful not to burn. Cookies will remain the same general size and shape after they bake.Remove from the oven and place the cookies on a cooling rack. Allow them to cool completely.Melt the almond barks in separate bowls in the microwave. Dip half of each cookie into the white almond bark and half into the chocolate bark. Immediately sprinkle or press toppings from the Dipping Bar over both sides of the cookies. Gently set on parchment paper or another nonstick surface and allow to cool before serving.'

Next, pour in yeast/water mixture and mix until just combined and the dough comes together in a very sticky mass.Form the dough into a ball, drizzle over olive oil and toss to coat the dough. Then cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set it aside for 1 to 2 hours, or store in the fridge until you need it.To make focaccia, remove half the dough from the bowl (leave the rest for another time) and place on a lightly floured surface. Place the chopped rosemary on top of the dough, then very gently knead it into the dough. (Don\\'t over knead!) Roll into a large, thin oval. Place on a sheet pan drizzled with olive oil. Drizzle more olive oil on top of the dough, then cover with plastic wrap. Put in a draft-free/warm place for 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Remove the plastic wrap (the dough will be puffy) and use your fingertips to press dimples all over the surface of the dough. Drizzle the surface with more olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt. Bake until the focaccia is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.Cut into pieces with a pizza wheel or sharp knife. Serve immediately."

Set aside.To assemble the sandwiches, spread a generous amount of mustard on half of the bread slices. Spread a generous amount of ranch dressing on the other half. (Definitely be generous; when the sandwiches cook, these will turn into more of a "sauce.")On the ranch-covered slices of bread, place a slice of cheese, a piece of chicken, 2 slices of bacon and a second slice of cheese. Top each with the mustard-covered slice of bread. Butter the outsides of the bread generously with the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, then grill in a panini maker. (If you do not have a panini maker, you can grill the sandwiches in a skillet, laying a heavy skillet on top of the sandwiches to press them together. Turn to grill the other side in the same way.)Slice the sandwiches in half and gobble them down immediately.'

S"For the berry butters: In separate batches, whip 2 sticks butter on high in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment. Switch to the paddle attachment. Add the blackberries. Turn the mixer to low for only about 5 seconds, just long enough for the berries to begin to mix in and break up, but not so long that it turns into a mess. Clean the mixer bowl and attachments and repeat with the remaining 2 sticks butter and the raspberries.With each batch, turn the berry butter out onto a long sheet of plastic wrap set over a long sheet of foil. First seal the plastic wrap around the cylinder, and then secure the foil around it. Twist the ends, gradually applying more pressure as you twist in order to make the cylinder taut. Once it\\'s a nice, neat cylinder of foil, place into the freezer for 30 minutes in order to quickly solidify it. Then transfer to the fridge until you\\'re ready to use. The butter should be very firm.For the French toast: Cut the bread into slices 1/2-inch thick. In a dish, whisk the egg yolks with the half-and-half, sugar, vanilla and lemon zest. Dip the bread slices in the egg mixture, coating both sides. Then remove from the dish and set aside. Repeat until all the bread is coated.Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Sizzle some butter in the skillet when hot. Cook the French toast on both sides until golden brown, being careful not to burn. Remove the berry butters from the fridge. Unwrap one end and cut some slices. Lay one slice onto each serving of French toast. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired, and then drizzle with maple syrup."

S'Special equipment: twelve 8-ounce mason jarsFor the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease (with cooking spray) and flour a 12-cup muffin pan.Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl.Beat the egg yolks with 3/4 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on high until the yolks are pale yellow. Stir in the milk and vanilla. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir very gently until combined.Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl with the mixer on high until soft peaks form. With the mixer on, pour in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Fold the egg white mixture into the batter very gently until just combined. Spoon the batter into the cups of the muffin pan using a 1/3-cup measure.Bake the cakes until risen and lightly golden, 13 to 14 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan.For the tres leches mixture: Combine the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, heavy cream, cream of coconut and rum if using in a small pitcher.For the whipped cream: Whip the cream with the sugar until soft peaks form.To assemble: Use a serrated knife to slice each cake in half across the middle. Place a cake half in the bottom of each 8-ounce mason jar. Spoon over 2 tablespoons of the tres leches mixture and 2 tablespoons crushed pineapple. Put the other half of each cake on top, and spoon over 2 to 3 more tablespoons of the tres leches mixture. Top each cake with lots of whipped cream and toasted coconut.Refrigerate until ready to serve. Several hours is fine. The cooler the cakes, the better.'

S"Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Drizzle the mushrooms with olive oil, and then sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside. Try not to eat them before the macaroni\\'s done. Turn down the heat to 350 degrees F.Next, fry the thick slices of bacon until chewy, but not yet crisp. Chop up the bacon into bite-size bits. Set aside. Try not to eat them before the macaroni\\'s done.In a large skillet over medium-low heat, saute the onions in 1 tablespoon of the butter, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside. Try not to... oh, never mind.Cook the macaroni until just undercooked. Set aside.To make the sauce, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour, whisking to combine. Let the roux cook for a minute or so, whisking constantly. Then pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Cook the white sauce until thick and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Next, add the half-and-half, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.Spoon some of the hot white sauce into the beaten eggs to temper them, stirring with a fork to incorporate the mixture without cooking the eggs. Pour the tempered eggs into the white sauce, stirring constantly as you add them. Add the fontina, gruyere, Parmesan and goat cheeses. Stir until the cheese all melts. Add the cooked macaroni and stir to coat. Splash in a little milk or hot water if needed for thinning.Butter a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Lay on half the onions, half the macaroni, half the mushrooms, half the gorgonzola and half the bacon. Repeat the layers, ending with the bacon. Bake until bubbly and hot, 20 to 25 minutes.This is the stuff that dreams - and love handles - are made of."

S"First, make the marinade for the chicken: Combine the olive oil, lime juice, cumin, salt, pepper, chipotle peppers and garlic in a blender and mix until totally pureed. Pour into a large resealable plastic bag with the chicken breasts. Seal the bag, smush it around to coat the chicken and place it in the fridge to marinate for at least 4 hours (overnight if possible).After the chicken has marinated, roast the poblano chiles one-by-one over the flame of your stovetop, using metal tongs to hold them, until the skin is totally charred. (If you don\\'t have a gas stove, you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven\\'s broiler.) When the skin is totally blackened, place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow the chiles to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Remove the chiles and use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds and membranes. Lay out the chile halves so they\\'ll be ready for the next step.Preheat a grill pan to medium-high heat (or use a skillet). Grill the chicken (or saute in the skillet) for 4 minutes on the first side. Turn the chicken over and lay 2 chile halves and a nice slice of cheese on the cooked side of each piece. Turn the heat to medium low and allow the chicken to finish cooking until it\\'s totally done in the center, 4 to 5 minutes. The cheese should melt on its own; if it needs a little help, invert an iron skillet over it (or put the lid on the skillet, if using). Serve!"

S"In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg, and whisk them together. Set the mixture aside for a minute.In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the brown sugar and softened butter until fluffy. Drizzle in the molasses, mixing well and scraping the sides halfway through if necessary. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the maple extract and mix well. Add the flour mixture in 3 batches, beating until just combined after each addition. The dough will be pretty dense and slightly dry to the touch. That\\'s the way you want it! Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours.When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.Roll the dough out 1/3 inch thick (rolling between 2 sheets of plastic wrap will keep the rolling pin from sticking). Cut using any cutters you like, and transfer onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cookies are baked through but still soft, 16 to 18 minutes."

Mix together the milk, vanilla and eggs in a separate bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring very gently until just combined. Melt the butter and add it to the batter, stirring gently to combine. Stir in more milk if needed for thinning; the batter should not be overly thick.Set a griddle over medium-low heat and butter the surface when it\\'s hot. Use a 1/4-cup measure to drop the batter onto the griddle in batches. Fry the pancakes on both sides until golden, about 2 minutes per side.Serve with an assortment of your favorite pancake toppings, such as mini chocolate chips, fresh blueberries, flavored yogurt, sliced bananas and extra pats of butter."

S"Peel and rinse the potatoes. Then cut them into sticks by cutting the potato in 4 or 5 vertical pieces, and then cutting each piece into sticks.Place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Allow them to soak, 2 to 3 hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak overnight.)When you\\'re ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay the potatoes on 2 baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot with paper towels to dry them.Heat a few inches of oil in a heavy pot to 300 degrees F. In 3 or 4 batches, cook the potatoes until soft, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. They should not be brown at this point! You just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain on new/dry paper towels.Once all the potatoes have been fried at 300 degrees F, turn up the heat until the oil reaches 400 degrees F. When the oil\\'s hot, start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until the fries are golden and crisp. Remove the potatoes from the oil and drain on paper towels.Sprinkle with sea salt and dive in!"

S"Special equipment: a deep-fry thermometerFor the fried chicken: Thoroughly rinse the chicken, then cover all the pieces with 1 3/4 cups of buttermilk. Soak in the fridge overnight or up to 24 hours.When you\\'re ready to fry the chicken, remove the bowl from the fridge and let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes to take off the chill.In the meantime, preheat the oven to 360 degrees F and mix the breading. Put the flour, seasoned salt, paprika, pepper, thyme and cayenne (extra cayenne if you like heat) in a very large bowl and stir together well.In a small bowl, combine the milk and remaining 1/4 cup buttermilk. Pour into the flour mixture and, with a fork, gradually mix until there are little lumps throughout. This will adhere to the chicken and make for a crispier breading. If necessary, add a little more flour or milk to the bowl in order to make it slightly lumpy.Heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 365 degrees F. Lower the heat slightly, if necessary, to keep the oil from getting hotter.Working in batches, thoroughly coat each chicken piece with the breading, pressing extra breading onto the chicken if necessary. Place the breaded pieces on a plate.Add the chicken to the oil 3 or 4 pieces at a time. Make sure they aren\\'t sticking together, then cover the skillet and fry for 5 to 7 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the chicken isn\\'t getting too brown. Turn the pieces over, cover again and cook 3 to 5 minutes more. All the while, monitor the temperature of the oil to make sure the chicken doesn\\'t burn. Transfer the fried chicken pieces to a baking sheet (they will not be completely cooked through) and continue frying the rest of the chicken.Bake the thighs for 15 minutes to finish the cooking process. Sometimes I\\'ll cut into the thicker part of one of the larger pieces, just to make sure the chicken is cooked through. (If any pink juice or meat is visible, the chicken needs to continue cooking in the oven.) Cover and keep warm.For the waffles: Preheat the waffle iron to the regular setting. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl.In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, vanilla and 2 egg yolks. Pour over the dry ingredients and very gently stir until halfway combined. Pour in the melted butter and chopped jalapenos and continue mixing very gently until combined.In a separate bowl (or using a mixer), beat the 4 egg whites with a whisk until stiff. Slowly fold them into the batter, stopping short of mixing them all the way through.Scoop the batter into your waffle iron in batches and cook according to the manufacturer\\'s directions (lean toward being a little deep golden and crisp!). Keep warm.For the sauce: Pour the pancake syrup and bourbon in a small pot and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and whisk in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, then the cayenne.To serve: Place 2 chicken thighs on top of a waffle. Pour the warm sauce over everything and serve immediately."

S"Dice up equal quantities of tomatoes and onions. Roughly chop the cilantro.Now, slice 1 or 2 jalapenos in half. With a spoon, scrape out the seeds. (If you like things spicy, leave in some of the white membranes.) Dice the jalapenos very finely; you want a hint of heat and jalapeno flavor, but you don\\'t want to cause any fires. Now dump the four ingredients into a bowl.Slice the lime in half and squeeze the juice from half the lime into the bowl. Sprinkle with salt, and stir together until combined. Be sure to taste the pico de gallo and adjust the seasonings, adding salt or more diced jalapeno if needed."

Combine the buttermilk, milk and egg in a small bowl and stir together with a fork. Add the baking soda and stir. Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and stir with a fork until just combined. Do not overmix.In a small bowl, melt 1/4 cup shortening in the microwave in 30-second intervals. Add the melted shortening to the batter, stirring constantly, until combined. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons shortening in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat. Pour the batter into the hot skillet and spread to even out the surface. Cook 1 minute on the stovetop, then transfer to the oven and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the cornbread is golden brown with crispy edges. Let cool 15 minutes in the skillet, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.Photograph by Dave Malosh'

(It helps to use a pan with a light-colored bottom so you can keep track of the color.) Swirl the pan occasionally to be sure the butter is cooking evenly. As the butter melts, it will begin to foam. The color will progress from lemony-yellow to golden-tan to, finally, a toasty-brown.Once you smell that nutty aroma, add the green beans and saute for 3 to 4 minutes.

S"Special equipment: a pastry cutterFor the perfect spiced pie crust: Mix the flour, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a bowl. Add the butter and vegetable shortening. Work the butter into the flour using a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. Add the white vinegar, egg and 5 tablespoons cold water and stir until just combined.Form 2 equal-sized balls. Place each in a large plastic bag (do not seal) and slightly flatten with a rolling pin; this makes it much easier to roll out the crust later. After flattening, seal the bag tightly. Place in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to chill.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Remove 1 bag of dough from the freezer (save the other dough for another use), remove the dough from the bag and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough starting at the center and working outward. Be gentle and patient; it\\'ll take a little time to get the dough completely rolled out. If you think the bottom is really sticking to the surface below while rolling, use a metal spatula to loosen it. When fully rolled out, loosen again with a spatula and lift the pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan (or you can roll the pastry over the rolling pin, lift it onto the pie pan and unroll it). Gently press the dough against the corner of the pan and tear off any excess dough. Then tuck under the edges and go around the pie pan pinching the dough to crimp the edge.For the pie filling: In a bowl, mix the apples, lemon juice, granulated sugar, flour and salt. Set aside.For the crumb topping: Cut the butter into the flour with a pastry cutter, then add in the brown sugar, oats and salt.Add the apples to the prepared pie shell and top with the crumb topping. Bake for 1 hour, covering the edge of the crust with foil if it starts to brown too quickly. After an hour, sprinkle the chopped pecans over the pie, then bake for a further 5 minutes.Remove the pie from the oven and pour 1/2 jar (or more, if you\\'re feeling dangerous and naughty) of caramel topping over the top. Allow to cool slightly before serving \\u2014 or don\\'t if you can\\'t wait!"

S"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Begin by grating the zest from the oranges. (If you don\\'t have a Microplane zester, please rush out to the nearest cooking-supply store and purchase one. Thank you.)Cream the butter and granulated sugar in a bowl with a mixer. Crack in the eggs and mix until well combined, about 4 minutes.Sift the flour onto a sheet of wax paper. Add it to the bowl. Gently stir with the mixer using as few strokes as possible so the muffins aren\\'t tough.In a small measuring cup or bowl, combine the buttermilk and baking soda. Add the buttermilk mixture to the batter and mix until just combined. Add the orange zest and mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.Grease 36 mini-muffin cups and fill each two-thirds full with batter. I like to use a small cookie scoop to put the muffin batter in the tins. Bake for 12 to 17 minutes, until light brown. Watch to make sure they don\\'t get too brown.Now, while the muffins are baking, prepare the glaze: Juice the 2 oranges whose zest you just stole. Add the orange juice and brown sugar to a medium bowl and stir together until just combined, but don\\'t worry about dissolving the brown sugar completely. You want the glaze to be grainy and textured.As soon as the muffins are done, drizzle the glaze all over the top. Be sure to thoroughly coat each muffin. Don\\'t worry if the glaze drips all over the pan; that means more for you to lick up later. Serve the muffins warm on a beautiful platter. Watch your guests\\' eyes roll back in their heads as they savor each bite.Photograph by Coral Von Zumwalt"

Remove the giblets and neck, set aside and keep the water in the saucepan.In the turkey roasting pan (which should not have been cleaned!), add back 1/4 cup turkey fat. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk it into the fat to form a paste. If the paste is too thick or clumpy, add a little more fat. If it\\'s too greasy, sprinkle in more flour. Whisk and cook the roux over medium-low heat until deep golden brown.Turn off the heat and add the whiskey, then turn the heat back on and whisk it in. Pour in the chicken broth, whisking the whole time, then add the maple syrup. Allow it to cook and thicken for several minutes, whisking occasionally. If the gravy gets too thick or if it\\'s too salty, thin it with a little of the giblet water. If the gravy is too thin, just keep cooking until it thickens up. Taste, then add salt and plenty of black pepper. Chop the giblets and add them to the gravy. Remove as much of the neck meat as you can and add it to the gravy too. Serve immediately!"

S'Special equipment: a deep-fry thermometerFor the sauce: In the bowl of a food processor, add the tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, chipotle and adobo sauce and salt and pepper to taste and process until smooth. If it is too thick, add some water a couple tablespoons at a time until it is the consistency of heavy cream. Scrape into a bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.For the falafel: Using the same processor bowl, add the chickpeas and process until coarsely ground. Add the flour, parsley, cilantro, baking powder, cumin, cayenne, scallion, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and process until well mixed but not totally smooth. Check the consistency to make sure it will hold together. If it is too dry, add some water a little at a time. Taste and adjust the seasoning.Add about 2 inches of vegetable oil to a deep skillet and heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325 degrees F.Using a small scoop or a tablespoon, scoop out small balls of the falafel mixture and gently drop them into the hot oil. Cook in batches, turning them over from time to time, until golden brown and cooked through, for between 30 and 60 seconds. Drain on paper towels while you cook the rest.To serve: Cut the top off each pita and form a pocket. Drizzle some sauce into each pita and add 4 or 5 falafel pieces. Top with the greens, carrots, scallions and plenty more sauce. Alternatively, build a salad with the vegetables, then top with falafel and sauce.'

S'Cook the wild rice according to the package instructions. (Do not add salt or cook it in broth; just cook in plain water.) Set aside.Mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Mix together the milk, vanilla and eggs in a separate bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring very gently until just combined. Add more milk if the batter seems too thick. It should definitely be thick but easily pourable. Add the melted butter to the batter, stirring gently to combine. Gently stir in the cooked wild rice. (Add half at first and see how you like the looks of the batter. Then slowly add in as much as you want.)Heat a skillet over medium-low heat and add some butter. Pour large spoonfuls of the batter onto the skillet and cook until the pancakes are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining batter.Cook the sausage links according to the package instructions.Serve the pancakes with an obscene amount of butter and warm syrup, along with some strawberries, melon chunks and blueberries.'

S'For the potatoes: Generously butter two 4-quart baking dishes.Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and add the potatoes. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, 20 to 25 minutes.For the shallots: Meanwhile, add the oil to a large skillet set over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the shallots in batches and fry until golden brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute per batch. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Drain the potatoes in a large colander. Put them back in the dry pot and put the pot back on the stove. Mash the potatoes over low heat, allowing all the steam to escape before adding the other ingredients. Turn off the heat and add 3 sticks butter, the cream cheese, heavy cream, salt and pepper. Mash to combine.Spread the shallots in the bottom of one of the buttered dishes, reserving a few for decorating the top. Scoop half the potatoes on top of the shallots and spread out. Arrange the reserved shallots on top. Scoop the rest of the potatoes into the second dish. (If you are making these ahead, cover and refrigerate the dishes at this stage.)To cook, throw pats of the remaining 1 stick butter over the top of the potatoes and bake until the butter is melted and the potatoes are warmed through, 20 to 30 minutes. (It will need 1 hour if coming from the fridge.)'

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S"Special equipment: a large brining bag, optional and a probe thermometerFor the maple-whiskey brine: Combine the whiskey, maple syrup, salt, peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic, rosemary, orange peel, apple peel and 8 cups (2 quarts) water in a large pot. Bring to a boil uncovered, stirring to dissolve the salt, then turn off the heat and cover. Allow to cool completely, then place in the fridge to chill.For the turkey: Remove the turkey from its packaging and remove the bags inside that hold the neck and giblets. Rinse the neck and giblets and put them in a plastic bag in the fridge; you\\'ll need them for the Maple-Whiskey Gravy. Rinse the turkey thoroughly with cold water. Place the turkey in a large brining bag or pot. Pour in the maple-whiskey brine, cover with cold water and place in the fridge for 16 to 24 hours so the brine can work its magic.When ready for roasting, preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse it thoroughly again inside and out. Soak the turkey in cold water for 15 to 20 minutes, then rinse again and pat dry. Tuck the wings underneath the turkey, then tie the legs together with kitchen string. Place the turkey breast-side up on a rack in a large, shallow roasting pan. Cover the pan with heavy-duty foil so that it\\'s well sealed. Roast for about 10 minutes per pound (about 2 1/2 hours for a 15-pound turkey and about 3 hours 20 minutes for a 20-pound turkey).Remove the turkey from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Remove the foil and set aside. (Put stuffing in the bird if you wish at this point.) Rub the butter all over the skin of the turkey, getting in the crevices. Insert a probe thermometer into the thigh, near the hip joint. Place the turkey, uncovered, back in the oven. Continue roasting, basting or brushing with the juices in the pan every 30 minutes, until the thermometer registers 165 degrees F and the juices are no longer pink. This could take another 2 to 2 1/2 hours, depending on the size of the bird.Remove the turkey from the oven and cover lightly with foil until you are ready to carve it. Pour the pan drippings into a fat separator and set aside for the Whiskey-Maple Gravy."

S"For the onions: Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add the red onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until soft and deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside and let cool slightly.For the hummus: Meanwhile, combine the chickpeas, tahini, cumin, garlic, lemon juice and some salt in a blender. Pulse until the mixture becomes somewhat smooth and combined, but do not over-mix. Add 1/2 to 1 cup cold water as needed to facilitate blending and reach the desired consistency. Add the olive oil and pulse a few more times just to incorporate. Taste and add more cumin, salt or garlic if needed. Pour the hummus into a bowl and stir to ensure it\\'s combined. Serve immediately, or refrigerate for up to 3 days.For the balsamic vinaigrette: Shake together the oil, vinegar and some salt and pepper in a Mason jar. This makes more than you\\'ll need for 1 wrap; store the rest in the fridge and use for another salad.For the wrap: Grill the tortilla on a grill pan over medium heat just until it has grill marks on the outside, 1 minute. (If you don\\'t have a grill pan, just use a skillet.) The tortilla should still be soft and pliable, with just a little bit of color! Let the tortilla cool slightly.To assemble the wrap, spread about 1/4 cup of the hummus down the middle third of the tortilla. Arrange the cooked onions and roasted red peppers all over the hummus. Add the artichoke heart halves. Toss the salad greens in 1 tablespoon of the balsamic vinaigrette, then lay them on the wrap. Finally, sprinkle the crumbled feta all over the greens. Carefully wrap up the tortilla, tucking in the ends. Slice the wrap down the middle, share with a friend and chow down!"

S'Contains Raw Eggs: The Food Network Kitchen suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the slight risk of salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S'Place the chocolate chips in a blender. Crack in the eggs, and then add the orange liqueur and salt. Pulse until the chocolate chips are partially pulverized, 5 to 7 times.With the blender running, carefully pour in the coffee in a steady stream through the small opening in the lid. The coffee will melt the chocolate and turn it into a smooth mixture. Turn off the blender when the mixture is very smooth. Pour the mixture into small mason jars, pretty wine glasses or demitasse cups.Place the jars on a tray and refrigerate them until firm, at least 2 or 3 hours. Yum!Whip the cream with the sugar and generously plop it onto the top of each glass. Cut a strip of orange peel, cut into strips and decorate with the orange peel twists.'

S"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the sweet potatoes on the oven rack and bake until fork-tender, about 45 minutes. When the potatoes are finished cooking, let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Slice them open lengthwise and scrape out the flesh with a fork into a large bowl. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F.Add the granulated sugar, milk, eggs, vanilla and salt to the bowl with the sweet potatoes. Mash the mixture with a potato masher until combined and slightly lumpy-you don\\'t want it to be perfectly smooth.Now, in a separate bowl, mash the brown sugar, pecans, flour and butter with a pastry cutter or fork until thoroughly combined. The mixture should resemble a crumble.Spread the sweet potato mixture in a 14-cup oval-shaped baking dish and sprinkle the crumb mixture all over the top. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes.Photographs by Kang Kim"

S'On the day before cooking, cut the cornbread, French bread and ciabatta into 1-inch cubes. Spread them out on 2 baking sheets and let them dry for approximately 24 hours.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Drizzle the Brussels sprouts and butternut squash with olive oil in a roasting pan and roast for 30 to 35 minutes.Meanwhile, warm up a large skillet over medium heat and add the butter and bacon pieces. When the bacon is cooked, add the celery, carrots and onions and cook until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, then add the parsley, rosemary, basil, thyme, and some salt and pepper and stir until combined. Cook for a couple of minutes.Get the cooked sprouts and squash out of the oven and reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F.Place the dried bread cubes into a large bowl and mix them up a bit. Add the roasted Brussels sprouts, squash, pecans and dried cherries and mix.Gradually ladle the broth mixture into the bread, tossing lightly as you go. Add a little more salt and pepper, then toss around and taste to check the seasoning. If you like it more moist, splash in more broth until it reaches the consistency that you like.Pile the dressing into a large casserole dish and bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes.'

Sprinkle in the flour and whisk into the fat until it\\'s all worked together into a paste. If paste is too thick/clumpy, add in a little more grease. If it\\'s too greasy, sprinkle in more flour. Whisk and cook the roux over medium-low heat until deep golden brown.Pour in the chicken broth, whisking the whole time. Allow to cook and thicken for several minutes, whisking occasionally. If the gravy gets too thick, or if it\\'s too salty, thin it with a little of the giblet water. If the gravy is too thin, just keep cooking it until it thickens up.Add plenty of black pepper. Chop the giblets and add them in. Remove as much of the neck meat as you can and add it to the gravy. Serve immediately!"

S"Special equipment: an ice cream makerFor the custard base and vanilla ice cream layer: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the half-and-half and sugar. Stir it around to combine.Using a small paring knife, split the vanilla bean down the middle. Scrape out the caviar inside and add it to the pan along with the bean. Stir the mixture around and heat it up until it\\'s hot but not boiling.Add the egg yolks to a medium bowl and whisk them vigorously until the yolks are slightly lighter in color, about 2 minutes.Remove the vanilla bean from the saucepan. Grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and drizzle it very slowly into the yolks, whisking constantly. This will temper the egg yolks so that they don\\'t scramble when they\\'re added to the saucepan. Add another ladle of the hot liquid, and when it\\'s mixed in, pour the egg mixture slowly into the half-and-half mixture, stirring with a spoon until the mixture is thick and coating the spoon, 2 minutes or so.Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean glass bowl and strain the custard. Don\\'t worry if it looks a little lumpy! That just means you\\'re perfectly imperfect. Add the heavy cream to the bowl and stir to combine. Divide the mixture into three pitchers; set aside one pitcher to work with for the chocolate ice cream layer, and chill the other two.For the chocolate ice cream layer: Melt the dark chocolate chips with the heavy cream over a double boiler. When the chocolate and cream mixture is smooth and melted, add 1 cup of the reserved custard and combine. Return this mixture back to the pitcher. (This step is to ease the mixing process to make it easier to pour back into the custard and could therefore be omitted.) Whisk the cocoa into the pitcher. Pour into an ice cream maker and churn as per the manufacturer\\'s instructions. (This will take approximately 1 hour.)Line two 6-cup loaf pans with plastic wrap. Scoop half of the chocolate ice cream into each. Smooth them over and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour.To make the vanilla ice-cream layer, add the second pitcher of custard to the ice cream maker and churn according to the instructions. (Again, approximately 1 hour.)Remove the loaf pans from the freezer and spread half of the vanilla ice cream in each. Smooth and return to the freezer for at least 1 hour.For the strawberry ice cream layer: Combine the strawberries, sugar and red food coloring in a blender and puree until smooth (or you can stop just short of smooth if you want a little texture). Pour the pureed strawberries into the final third of the chilled custard mixtures and stir. Pour into the ice cream maker and churn.Remove the two pans from the freezer and scoop half of the strawberry ice cream into each, making the final layer. Smooth and return to the freezer for at least an hour.To serve: Remove the loaf pans from the freezer, turn them upside down onto a serving plate and remove the plastic wrap. Slice neatly with a knife that has been dipped in very hot water."

Using a pastry cutter, cut the butter bits and shortening into the dry mixture until blended thoroughly. Mix in the cheese, then fold in the buttermilk until the dough comes together.On a lightly floured surface, turn out the dough and press into a circle 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut out circles with a biscuit cutter or a glass. Place the biscuits in cast-iron skillets, then brush the tops with the melted butter. Bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, then set aside to cool a little.For the sandwiches: Next, add the sausage patties to a skillet over medium heat and fry until cooked through. Set aside and keep warm. In the same skillet, fry the eggs, turning them over to cook the yolks through.Now make a sandwich by cutting a biscuit in half. Put a sausage patty on the bottom half. Top with an egg, some hot sauce and a slice of cheese. Cover with the top and eat, or wrap in foil to keep warm.'

S"Special equipment: 12 lollipop sticks (sold in craft stores) Melt the chocolate or white (or both) almond bark in a double boiler (melt them separately if using both). Next melt the blue and orange candy melting wafers separately in double boilers. Stir them all until they are nice and smooth. These will be your marshmallow coatings.One by one, dip the very tip of each lollipop stick into one of the coatings. Then stick that end of the stick into a marshmallow until it\\'s not quite all the way through. Repeat with the rest of the marshmallows, standing them up as you go.Next, roll each marshmallow in the coating of your choice, and then tap the stick gently on the side of the double boiler to get rid of the excess. Using your fingers, sprinkle the topping of your choice all over the coating. For a rocky road version, dip in the chocolate and roll in the chopped pecans. For a s\\'more version, dip in the chocolate and roll in the graham cracker crumbs. For a cookies and cream version, dip in the white chocolate and roll in the crushed chocolate sandwich cookies.Set the pops stick-side up on a piece of waxed paper, or stick them into florist foam that makes flowers stand up."

S'For the dough: Sprinkle the yeast over 3 cups warm (not lukewarm) water. Let stand for a few minutes.In a mixer, combine the flour and salt. With the mixer running on low speed (with a paddle attachment), drizzle in the olive oil until combined with the flour. Next, pour in the yeast/water mixture and mix until just combined and the dough comes together. (The dough will be sticky.) Form the dough into a ball.Coat a separate mixing bowl with a light drizzle of olive oil and toss the dough in the olive oil to coat. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set it aside for 1 hour to rise. Then put it in the fridge to chill for 2 hours or longer. (The dough is much easier to work with when very cold.)For the mushroom version: Add the olive oil to a pan with the heat on medium and saute the garlic and onions for about a minute. Add the mushrooms and thyme and saute for 3 minutes. Add the white wine and reduce for a couple of minutes until most of the liquid is gone. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool to room temperature.For the meat version: Crumble the Italian sausage into a skillet with some olive oil and brown until cooked through, 5 minutes. Let cool.When you are ready to make the pizza pockets, take half the dough and roll it out into a large rectangle. Cut into 18 rectangles with a rectangular cutter. Put 9 of the rectangles onto a baking sheet and top them with the fillings for the meat version: some marinara sauce, mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni and Canadian bacon. Lay the other 9 rectangles on top and crimp the edges with a fork. Brush with the beaten egg. Put into the freezer to flash-freeze for 30 minutes.Repeat with the other half of the dough and the fillings for the mushroom version: some mozzarella, goat cheese and the sauteed mushrooms.When the pockets have been flash-frozen, transfer to ziptop bags and store in the freezer.When ready to cook, place on a baking sheet and bake at 450 degrees F for 10 to 12 minutes.'

S'First, whip up the pie crust: Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the butter and shortening. Work the butter into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles.Add the egg with, 5 tablespoons cold water and the vinegar. Stir the mixture until just combined. Divide the dough in half and chill until needed. Once chilled, sprinkle the cutting board or counter liberally with flour. Roll half of the dough into a large circle and place in a standard pie pan. Crimp the edges according to desired look. Reserve the other half of dough for another use.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Next, make the filling: Mix the white sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, butter, vanilla and eggs together in a bowl. Pour the pecans in the bottom of the unbaked pie shell.Pour syrup mixture over the top. Cover top and crust lightly/gently with foil. Bake the pie for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, and then continue baking for 20 minutes, being careful not to burn the crust or pecans.The pie should not be overly jiggly when you remove it from the oven (though it will jiggle a bit). If it shakes a lot, cover with foil and bake until set, an additional 20 minutes. Required baking time seems to vary widely with this recipe. Sometimes it takes 50 minutes, sometimes it takes 75!Allow to cool for several hours or overnight. Serve in thin slivers.'

Minimum 1 hour but overnight is fine.Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.To make the butter, put the pasilla chile peppers on a baking sheet and bake them until very brittle, about 15 minutes. When they are done, remove and cool them. Remove the seeds and crumble the chiles into a food processor. Add the butter and process until combined.Lay out a sheet of plastic wrap on top of a sheet of foil. Turn the butter out onto the wrap and roll it into a cylinder. First wrap the plastic wrap around the cylinder and then secure the foil around it. Twist the ends, gradually applying more pressure as you twist, in order to make the cylinder taught. Alternatively, pile the butter into ramekins and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate it until firm.Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the corn from the water and shake or pat them dry. Grill the corn on the cob for 10 minutes, turning it every couple of minutes. Remove the corn cobs from the grill and pull the husks back on each one. Lay slices of the chilled pasilla butter on and let it melt. The corn will have beautiful flecks of chile. Or serve the ramekins on the dinner table for everyone to help themselves."

Cook over the simmering water, and use a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl. Cook until thick. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool.Place the mascarpone cheese in a bowl and stir until smooth. In another mixing bowl, combine the whipping cream and remaining 4 tablespoons sugar and whip until not quite stiff. To the bowl of whipped cream, add the softened mascarpone cheese and the chilled egg yolk mixture. Fold the mixture gently. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.Add the remaining 1/4 cup marsala and vanilla to the espresso. Arrange the ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9- by 13-inch pan. Spoon a small amount of the espresso mixture over each ladyfinger (keep it under 1 tablespoon per cookie and you\\'ll be fine). Plop one-third of the cold mascarpone mixture on top and spread it into a layer. Scatter with raspberries and grate over a thin layer of semisweet chocolate. Repeat the process two more times.Cover and refrigerate for a few hours before serving. This allows for more moisture to soften the cookies and the whole mixture to meld together.To serve, spoon out helpings onto individual plates.Cook\\'s Note: Tiramisu does not last beyond 24 to 36 hours, as everything eventually starts to break down and become soupy."

S'Make the batter before removing the prime rib from the oven: Combine the eggs and half-and-half in a bowl and whisk until they\\\'re totally combined. Throw the flour and 2 teaspoons salt into a sifter and sift them straight into the bowl. Whisk until it\\\'s nice and smooth, then refrigerate until the prime rib is ready.After the beef is removed from the pan, increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Use a slotted spoon to remove the peppercorns, herbs and excess salt from the drippings. Pour the remaining drippings into a separate container. They should be speckled and lovely!Pour a small amount (about 1/2 teaspoon or so) of the drippings into each cup of a standard muffin pan and place the pan in the hot oven for a couple of minutes, or until just before the drippings begin to smoke.Carefully remove the pan from the oven and immediately fill the muffin cups about 1/2 to 2/3 full. Bake 13 to 14 minutes, or until they\\\'ve "popped" about as much as they can pop. Serve them in a basket with a pretty napkin right next to the prime rib.Photograph by Con Poulos'

Layer half the bread, half the kale, half the mushrooms, half the sausage and half the cheese in the prepared pan. Repeat with the other half of the same ingredients, ending with the cheese. Slowly pour the egg mixture all over the top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.Twenty to thirty minutes before baking, remove the lasagna pan from the fridge. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Replace the plastic wrap on top of the strata with aluminum foil.

S"For the cinnamon ice cream: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the half-and-half and sugar. Stir it around to combine and allow to warm. Next, add the vanilla extract and cinnamon sticks. Stir the mixture around and heat it up until it\\'s hot but not boiling.Add the egg yolks to a medium bowl and whisk them vigorously until slightly lighter in color, about 2 minutes.Remove the cinnamon sticks from the half-and-half mixture and discard. Grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and drizzle it very slowly into the yolks, whisking constantly. This will temper the egg yolks so that they don\\'t scramble when they\\'re added to the pan. Add another ladle of the hot liquid, and when it\\'s mixed in, pour the egg mixture slowly into the pan with the half-and-half mixture, stirring with a spoon. Stir and cook it until the mixture is thick and coating the spoon, for 2 minutes or so.Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean glass bowl and strain the custard. Don\\'t worry if it looks a little lumpy. Add the heavy cream to the bowl and stir to combine. Finally, whisk in the ground cinnamon, and then cover the bowl and refrigerate until completely cool.Pour the cooled mixture into an ice cream maker and process according to your machine\\'s instructions. When it\\'s finished churning, it will still be in the soft-serve stage. Transfer the mixture to a freezer container and place in the freezer until it\\'s frozen firm, for several hours.For the cinnamon crisps: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Place the tortillas on a baking sheet and brush both sides with the butter. Sprinkle both sides of the tortillas generously with the cinnamon-sugar mixture.Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes, and then allow them to cool to room temperature. Break into large pieces and set aside.Serve the ice cream with the cinnamon crisps."

S"For the cookies: Cream the shortening, granulated sugar, orange zest and vanilla thoroughly in a stand mixer for 2 minutes. Add in the egg and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 more minute. Add in the milk and mix.Sift the dry ingredients together, then blend into the cream mixture. Divide the dough in half (thirds if you double your recipe), slightly flatten between two sheets of waxed paper and refrigerate for one hour (or freeze for 20 minutes).Roll out the dough 1/4-inch thick on a lightly floured surface and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter. Transfer the shapes to lightly greased cookie sheets and chill until firm, about 30 minutes.For the egg yolk glaze: While the dough is chilling, combine the egg yolk, 1 teaspoons water and food coloring. Paint the cookies with a soft brush with the glaze.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.After brushing with the glaze, bake for 6 to 7 minutes. The cookies will be slightly puffed and the glaze will look crackled. Do not allow the cookies to brown. Bake in batches, two sheets total if you don\\'t reroll the scraps.For the decorative icing: While cookies are baking, mix the confectioners\\' sugar, milk and egg whites. When making the white decorative icing, make sure that it is thick and somewhat retains its shape.Remove cookies from oven to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Then, using a pastry bag or zip-top bag, pipe with white icing to decorate."

(If you don\\'t have a gas stove, you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven\\'s broiler.) When the skin is totally blackened, place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow the chiles to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Remove the chiles and use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds and membranes.Divide the ingredients into 3 batches so they will fit into a 12-cup processorCombine whole tomatoes, roast chiles, cilantro, onions, garlic, jalapeno, cumin, salt, sugar and lime juice in a blender or food processor.Pulse until you get the salsa to the consistency you\\'d like.

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Take the potatoes out of the freezer while you are preparing the rest of the ingredients.Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, then melt 6 tablespoons of the butter in it. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and stir to incorporate. Cook for a minute or 2 to cook out the raw flour, but do not let it color. Whisk in the milk, making sure to get out all the lumps. Add the broth and whisk again if there are still lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and allow it to thicken, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat and stir in the Monterey Jack, sour cream and Cheddar. Add the hash brown potatoes and mix everything together. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish.Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a small pan. Put the potato chips and Parmesan in a bowl and crush the potato chips. Pour in the melted butter and toss to coat. Sprinkle the crumbs over the top of the potatoes.Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until golden brown on top and bubbling around the edges, about 15 minutes more.

S"Allow the cubed bread to sit out on cookie sheets for several hours or overnight, until completely dried out.Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.Wash the mushrooms thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. Toss in a bowl with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. The mushrooms will be very coated, but that\\'s good! Divide the mushrooms between 2 cookie sheets and roast in the upper half of the oven for at least 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through roasting. Remove from the oven when the mushrooms are deep brown. Set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F.In a large skillet, crumble and brown the sausage over medium-high heat. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set aside. Pour off any excess grease and, without cleaning the skillet, add in the diced onions and brown for 5 minutes. Increase the heat to high and add the diced apples, brown sugar and some salt. Cook until deep golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Decrease the heat to medium and pour in the wine (be careful if you\\'re using an open flame). Stir and cook to reduce the liquid by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the apple/onion mixture into a bowl and set aside.Return the skillet to medium heat (again, without washing) and add the chicken broth, rosemary, sage, thyme, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Heat for a few minutes, and then set aside.Add the bread to a large bowl, and then add the browned sausage, mushrooms and apple/onion mixture (and any juice that might have accumulated). Next, add the broth mixture gradually as you toss the ingredients, being prepared to not use all of the liquid according to your taste.Check the seasonings at the end and add in minced parsley. Pour into a large baking dish (I used an iron skillet) and bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes. (Or you can stuff the turkey if you\\'re into that kind of thing.)Delicious!"

Continue washing the potatoes until the water runs clear. Cover with water again and allow them to soak for 2 or 3 hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak for up to 3 days.)When you\\'re ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay the potatoes sticks on baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot them with more paper towels to dry them.Heat a few inches of oil in a heavy pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 300 degrees F.

Remove each batch and drain them on new/dry paper towels.When all the potatoes have been fried once, turn up the heat until the oil reaches 400 degrees F. Start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until the fries are golden and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.Sprinkle the fries with sea salt and dive in!"

S"Allow the cornbread, French bread and crusty bread to sit out on cookie sheets for several hours or overnight, until completely dried out.Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.Wash the mushrooms thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. Toss in a bowl with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Mushrooms will be very coated, but that\\'s good! Divide the mushrooms between two sheet pans and roast in the upper half of the oven for at least 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through roasting. Remove from the oven when the mushrooms are deep brown. Set aside.Turn the oven down to 375 degrees F.In a large skillet, crumble and the brown sausage over medium-high heat. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set aside. Pour off any excess grease, and without cleaning the skillet, add in the onions and brown for 5 minutes. Increase the heat to high and add the diced apples, brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until deep golden brown.Decrease the heat to medium and pour in the wine (be careful if you\\'re using an open flame). Stir and cook to reduce the liquid by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the apple/onion mixture into a bowl and set aside.Return the skillet to medium heat (again, without washing) and add the chicken broth, rosemary, sage, thyme, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Heat for a few minutes, then set aside.Add the bread to a large bowl, then add the browned sausage, mushrooms and apple/onion mixture (and any juice that might have accumulated). Next, add the broth mixture gradually as you toss the ingredients, being prepared not to use all of the liquid according to your taste.Check the seasonings at the end and add in minced parsley. Pour into a large baking dish (I used an iron skillet) and bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes. (Or you can stuff the turkey if you\\'re into that kind of thing.)Delicious!"

S'Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Peel and core the apples, then cut them into quarters.Spread the butter on the bottom of a 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet. Mix the sugar, salt and vanilla together to evenly distribute the caviar. Sprinkle the sugar mixture evenly over the butter. Squeeze over the lemon juice.Place the apple quarters cut-side up on top. Remember, the bottom will become the top so make it look pretty. Put the pan over medium heat and cook until the sugar melts, caramelizes and begins to thicken. The apples will release their juices during this process, so it could take 10 to 15 minutes. If the juices start getting too dark, lower the heat a little.While the apples are cooking, take the puff pastry out of the fridge. Use a knife to cut a circle just big enough to fit over the top of the apples in the skillet. Keep chilled.When the sugar has caramelized, place the pastry circle over the apples, gently tucking in the sides. Transfer to the oven and bake until the pastry is risen and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes.Carefully turn the tarte tatin out onto a serving plate. Serve with whipped cream.'

Blanch the broccoli by throwing the florets into the boiling water until bright green and still slightly crisp, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Immediately drain the broccoli and plunge it into the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove it from the ice water and set it aside.In a skillet over medium heat, add 1/4 inch of vegetable oil. Add the onions and fry until browned and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm.In another skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for a minute or 2, but do not let the flour brown. Whisk in the milk and cook until it thickens. Turn the heat to low, stir in the Cheddar and pepper Jack and cook until they are melted. Add the broccoli and cook, stirring, until the broccoli is warmed through.Make a slit down the length of each potato using a fork. Push in the ends to open up the potatoes and break up some of the potato inside. Pour a ladle of the cheese sauce over each potato. Garnish with the crispy onions and serve while hot.'

S"Mash the beans.Using a fork, mash the beans in a medium bowl until they are mushy but still have some whole bean pieces throughout.Make the burger mixture.Mix the breadcrumbs, grated onion, chili powder, egg and some salt and pepper into the beans. Add a splash of water if the mixture looks dry. Set aside for 5 minutes. Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add a few tablespoons of canola oil.Form the patties.Divide the bean mixture into 4 equal balls and form into 4 nice, neat patties. Black bean burgers don\\'t shrink when they cook, so whatever size you make them when they go into the skillet will be the size they are when they come out.Cook the burgers.Cook the burgers until browned, 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Add a slice of Swiss cheese to the top of each burger. Invert a second skillet on top of the first skillet and continue cooking, 2 minutes, until the cheese is melted.Top the burgers.Combine the mayonnaise and some hot sauce in a small bowl. Serve the burgers on toasted buns with the spicy mayonnaise, lettuce and sliced tomatoes.Photograph by David Malosh"

S"Remove the thawed phyllo from the fridge 1 hour before using. When working with the phyllo dough, only remove the sheets you immediately need, keeping the other sheets covered in plastic wrap, then a damp cloth.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) of the butter in a small saucepan.Toss together the chopped pecans and cinnamon in a bowl. Set aside.Thoroughly butter a rectangular baking pan with the melted butter. Make sure the sheets of phyllo will generally fit in the pan. (If they\\'re a little bigger, that\\'s okay; if they\\'re much bigger, just trim them with a sharp knife.)Butter the top sheet of phyllo with melted butter, then grab it and the unbuttered sheet below it. Flip the sheets over and set them in the pan buttered-side down. Press them lightly into the pan. Repeat this twice more, so that you have 6 sheets of phyllo in the pan, 3 of the sheets buttered.Sprinkle on enough pecans to make a single layer. Butter 2 sheets of phyllo and place them on top of the pecans buttered-sides down. Add more pecans, then 2 more buttered phyllo sheets. Repeat this a couple more times, or until you\\'re out of pecans. Top with 4 more buttered phyllo sheets, buttered-sides down. Butter the top of the final sheet.Cut a diagonal diamond pattern in the baklava using a very sharp knife. Bake until very golden brown, about 45 minutes.While the baklava is baking, combine the honey, sugar, vanilla, 1/2 cup water and the remaining 1 stick butter in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.When you remove the baklava from the oven, drizzle half of the honey mixture evenly all over the top. Allow it to sit and absorb for a minute, then drizzle on a little more until you think it\\'s thoroughly moistened. You\\'ll likely have some of the honey mixture leftover, which you can drink with a straw. Just kidding.Allow the baklava to cool, uncovered, for several hours. Once cool and sticky and divine, carefully remove from the pan and serve with coffee (or give as gifts!)."

Add the rye flour and mix on medium until smooth. Slowly beat in the all-purpose flour.

Divide it in 2, knead each piece a couple of times and form them into rounds. Put the rounds on an oiled baking sheet, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Bake until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool.For the honey butter: While the bread is baking, put the butter, honey and just a dash of salt and pepper in a bowl and whisk it together. Scrape out into a ramekin and refrigerate. Remove from the refrigerator about a half hour before using.'

Sear the scallops, then the shrimp, until they\\'re nice and black/brown.Meanwhile, grab 2 large sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil and overlap them in a platter with a little depth. It should be large enough to hold the entire pasta dish.Mix the drained pasta with the sauce and tip it onto the foil. Then arrange the sauteed seafood on top. Tightly wrap the foil into a package.Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and keep warm until serving.To serve: Open the foil package right before serving. Drizzle warm cream over the top and sprinkle with torn basil and parsley."

It should fit snugly around the cracker, but not be pulled too taut. Place the bacon-wrapped crackers onto the rack. Place the baking sheet in the oven for about 2 hours.

S'For the butternut squash and kale: Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter and the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the squash and sprinkle with the salt, chile powder and pepper. Cook for several minutes, turning gently with a spatula, until the squash is deep golden brown and tender (but not falling apart). Remove to a plate and set aside.In the same skillet, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat and add in the kale. Toss it around with tongs and cook it for 3 to 4 minutes. Add in the cooked squash and gently toss together. Remove to a plate and set aside.For the risotto: Heat the broth in a saucepan over low heat. Keep warm.Add the butter to the same skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir, cooking for 1 minute.Reduce the heat to low. In 1-cup increments, begin adding the broth to the skillet, stirring to combine and gently stirring as the broth is absorbed. As soon as the liquid disappears, add in another cup to cup-and-a-half of broth. Continue this process, stirring gently as the broth incorporates and the rice starts to become tender. Add salt and pepper along the way.Taste the rice after about 5 cups of broth have been absorbed and see what the consistency is. Add another 1 to 2 cups of broth as needed to get the rice to the right consistency; it should be tender with just a little bit of "bite."When the rice is tender, add in the cooked squash and kale plus the turmeric and stir gently. Add the Parmesan shavings and cream and stir until it\\\'s just combined. Taste and add more salt and pepper as needed.Sprinkle the minced parsley over the top and serve immediately with extra Parmesan shavings!'

Cut 1 1/2 sticks of the butter into cubes, then cut the butter cubes into the flour mixture using a pastry cutter or 2 knives. Stir in the pecans and the reserved orange zest.Spread the topping over the fruit. Cut the remaining 1/2 stick butter into cubes and dot the top of the crisp with it. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking until the top is browned and the fruit is bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool a bit before serving.For the whipped cream: Mix the cream and granulated sugar in a bowl and whip to the desired consistency.Plate the crisp into individual bowls and top with the whipped cream.'

S"Slice the pound cake (frozen is fine) into 1- to 1 1/2-inch slices. Next, with a biscuit cutter or cookie cutter that fits the bottom of the flower pot, cut the slices into rounds. (You can put the scraps in a zip-top freezer bag and use them at a later date.)Into each of your (washed and dried) flower pots, drop a round of pound cake, lightly pressing to make sure they are all the way down. Hold a straw up against the side of a flowerpot and snip it so it\\'s 1/2 to 1 inch shorter than the top. Then, just use that as a guide to cut the rest of the straws. Stick each straw into the center of each pot, anchoring it into the cake.Now, grab whatever flavor ice cream you\\'d like to use, and either set it out on the counter to soften it OR nuke it for 20 seconds or so. It needs to be somewhat soft for this step. Just spoon it into the pots, working it around the straw, until it almost reaches the very tip top of the straw. Clean up the top edges of the pot with a damp paper towel. Now return the pots to the freezer until firm.In a food processor, pulse the cookies until they resemble nice, rich topsoil. (You can also crush them in a zip-top bag with a rolling pin.) When they are nice and firm, take the pots out of the freezer. Place a couple of gummy worms on top of the ice cream, then spoon the dirt (crushed cookies) over the top. Be generous here! Place a fresh flower into the straw and serve immediately."

S"Stir together the half-and-half and 2 cups of the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Split the vanilla bean, scrape out the caviar and add it to the mixture (or add the vanilla extract). Heat the mixture until it\\'s hot but not simmering or boiling.In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks vigorously with a whisk until they start to lighten in color, about 2 minutes.Next, grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and very slowly drizzle it into the bowl with the egg yolks, whisking the whole time. (The purpose of this is to temper the egg yolks and bring them to a good temperature before adding them to the pan.) Repeat with a second ladle of hot half-and-half mixture, making sure to whisk the whole time.Pour the tempered yolks into the saucepan with the rest of the half-and-half mixture and stir gently with a wooden spoon, cooking it slowly, until it\\'s thick enough to coat the spoon, 2 to 4 minutes.Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean bowl. Pour the thick half-and-half liquid through the strainer into the bowl. Add the heavy cream and stir gently to combine. Refrigerate this mixture until chilled, about 2 hours.Meanwhile, combine the strawberries and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a blender. Puree until smooth (or you can stop just short of smooth if you want a little texture). Pour the pureed strawberries into the chilled custard mixture and stir.Now pour this mixture into your ice cream maker and freeze it according to the manufacturer\\'s directions. Depending on the size of your machine, you may need to do this in 2 batches. Transfer to a freezer-safe container and place in the freezer until frozen firm, at least 4 hours."

S"Fry the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and pour off the excess grease.Return the skillet to the stove over high heat. Add a couple tablespoons of butter. When it\\'s melted and the skillet is hot, add the onions, bell peppers and jalapenos. Stir the veggies around and cook until starting to soften and turn golden brown.Meanwhile, mix together the half-and-half, eggs and some salt and pepper in a bowl. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet with the veggies. Scoot the eggs around the skillet with a spatula, cooking slowly, until the eggs are done. Turn off the heat and set aside.To assemble the quesadillas, set a griddle or skillet over medium-low heat and add some butter. Toss together the grated Cheddar and Monterey Jack in a bowl. Put a tortilla on the griddle and add a layer of cheese, a layer of the cooked eggs and veggies, a layer of bacon slices, a layer of avocado if using and another layer of cheese. Top with a second tortilla. Cook on both sides, flipping carefully, until the cheeses are totally melted and the filling is hot. Repeat with the other tortillas and ingredients.Slice the 3 quesadillas into 4 wedges each. Serve on a plate with sour cream and pico de gallo or salsa (or grab them and head out the door!)."

Pour in the milk and egg yolks and whisk together. Add the vanilla. Stir over medium heat until the mixture just barely comes to a boil and becomes thick, 6 to 8 minutes (maybe less, maybe more; just watch it!). The second it starts to bubble and thicken (note: it should be thick like pudding!), remove it from the heat. Add the white chocolate and butter and stir until everything is beautifully combined.Pour the pudding into the glasses on top of the crumb base. Serve warm or chill in the fridge for 2 hours.

S'Generously butter a 4-quart baking dish. Peel the potatoes and cut into chunks. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and add the potatoes. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, 20 to 25 minutes.Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, fry the shallots until they are slightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.Drain the potatoes in a large colander. Place them back in the dry pot and put the pot on the stove. Mash the potatoes over low heat, allowing all the steam to escape before adding in the other ingredients. Turn off the heat and add 1 1/2 sticks butter, the cream cheese, heavy cream, seasoned salt, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Mash to combine.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread three-quarters of the shallots in the bottom of the baking dish. Scoop the mashed potatoes on top and spread them over the shallots. Sprinkle the remaining shallots on top of the potatoes.Cut the remaining 1/2 stick butter into pieces and sprinkle over the potatoes. Bake until the butter is melted and the potatoes are warmed through, 25 to 30 minutes.The potatoes can be made a day ahead through the end of step 4; cover and refrigerate. Before serving, dot with butter and bake for an hour. Photograph by Dave Malosh'

S'For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch round cake pan. Line the bottom with parchment paper and butter again. Dust with flour/cocoa.In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in the cocoa. Add the boiling water and allow the mixture to boil for 30 seconds, then turn off the heat. Add the flour mixture and stir lightly to cool.In a measuring cup, whisk together the buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla and egg. Stir the buttermilk mixture into the butter/chocolate mixture. Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove the cake from the pan and let cool.For the pudding: While the cake is baking, make the pudding. In a medium pot over medium heat, add 1/2 cup sugar. Melt the sugar, swirling the pot occasionally. When the sugar gets to a medium amber color, remove from the heat. (Keep your eye on this as it can go to burnt very quickly.)Whisk together the cornstarch, salt, 1 cup milk and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Slowly and carefully stir this mixture into the hot sugar. Return the pot to medium-low heat and stir until the caramel is all melted and smooth. Whisk together the egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup milk in a small bowl and stir that into the pot. Cook until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Strain into a bowl to remove any lumps. Press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the pudding. Let cool, then refrigerate.To finish: Cut the cake in half and put the bottom piece onto a serving plate. Spread the pudding evenly over this layer. Sprinkle on a little salt and place the top piece over the pudding.For the glaze: In a small pot over medium heat, heat the cream but do not let it boil. Add the chocolate and stir until smooth. Stir in the vanilla.Pour the glaze over the top so that it drips down the sides of the cake. Let set a few minutes. Refrigerate until ready to serve.'

S"Begin by making the maple cream sauce. It needs to chill before serving.Pour the cream into a heavy saucepan. Add the maple syrup and corn syrup. Cook over a moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened and reduced by about a third, about 20 minutes. Chill for at least an hour before serving over the warm peach crisp.To prepare the peach crisp, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch square or 8- by 12-inch baking dish.Start with the crumb mixture. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.Cut the cold butter into pieces. Add the butter to the bowl and use a fork, pastry cutter or pastry blender to cut into the flour mixture. The mixture should resemble a moist, coarse meal.Place the peaches in a bowl, add the lemon zest to the peaches, mix in the lemon juice and maple syrup and gently stir the peaches to combine. Pour the peaches into the prepared baking dish. Top with the crumb mixture, evening out the surface with a fork.Cover tightly with foil and bake, about 15 minutes.Remove the foil and bake until the topping is crisp and golden brown, about 30 minutes more. If the topping appears underdone, continue baking in 10 minute increments until it\\'s done.Spoon the warm crisp onto a plate, and drizzle the chilled maple cream sauce over the top."

S'For the dough: In a large saucepan, combine the milk, vegetable oil and granulated sugar. Heat until hot but not boiling, then remove the pan from the stove and allow it to cool until the mixture is warm to the touch but not too hot. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the liquid and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. Stir in the pumpkin puree until combined.Combine 4 cups of the flour with the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Sprinkle it into the saucepan and stir until it just comes together. Cover the saucepan with a dish towel and set in a warm, draft-free place for 1 hour.After 1 hour, the mixture should be very puffy and at least doubled in size. Stir in the baking powder, baking soda, salt and remaining 1/2 cup flour until totally combined.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Drizzle butter into 3 pie pans (or a larger baking dish) and smear it all over the bottom of the pans.Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and press it into a rectangular shape. If it is overly sticky, sprinkle generously with flour until easier to handle. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a large rectangle about 18 inches by 24 inches.For the filling: Drizzle the melted butter over the dough and smear it all over the surface with your fingers. Mix together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Sprinkle this mixture all over the surface of the dough, covering all the melted butter. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup chopped pecans.Starting at the top, roll the dough toward you into a large log, moving back and forth down the line of dough (in a "typewriter" motion) and always rolling toward you. Roll it tightly as you go so the rolls with be nice and neat. When it\\\'s all rolled, pinch the seam closed and turn the roll over so that the seam is facing down. Slice into 1/2- to 3/4-inch slices and place the slices in the buttered pan(s). Allow to rise for 20 minutes.Bake until the rolls are nice and golden brown around the edges, 15 to 18 minutes.For the frosting: While the rolls are baking, make the frosting by combining the cream cheese, powdered sugar, milk, butter and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until fluffy, adding more milk if you\\\'d like a thinner frosting.Frost the rolls the second they come out of the oven. Sprinkle the extra pecans over the frosting, then allow them to sit for 15 minutes before serving.Delicious!'

S"Make the pizza dough: Mix the yeast with 1 1/2 cups warm water and set aside for 8 to 10 minutes. Mix together the flour, olive oil and salt in a bowl using an electric mixer. With the speed on low, drizzle in the yeast/water mixture and mix until totally combined. Cover the bowl with a towel and set in a warm, draft-free place. Allow to rise for 1 to 2 hours.Pour the black beans into a saucepan. Add the taco seasoning and heat up the beans over medium-low heat. Use a potato masher to mash the beans to the desired texture. Continue cooking/heating over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beans are no longer runny (they should be the texture of refried beans). Set aside.In a small skillet, heat the canola oil over medium heat. When hot enough to fry, drop in the tortilla strips in batches, frying them quickly and removing them from the oil with a fork when crisp--30 to 45 seconds per batch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.Position an oven rack in the bottom position in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Oil a baking sheet with some olive oil.Remove half of the pizza dough from the bowl. (Place the remaining half in a large plastic bag and refrigerate, saving it for another use.) With your hands, spread the dough out on the oiled baking sheet, making sure it\\'s relatively thin. Spread a layer of refried beans all over the pizza crust. Sprinkle the grated Cheddar and Monterey Jack over the top. Place the baking sheet on the bottom rack in the oven and bake for about 25 minutes, watching to make sure the crust doesn\\'t burn. Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle on the shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and cilantro leaves.Mix together the sour cream and hot sauce in a small bowl, adding enough hot sauce to make the mixture pourable. With a spoon (or you can put it in a pastry bag), drizzle the mixture over the finished pizza.Sprinkle with the tortilla strips. Cut into squares and serve immediately with good-quality salsa."

Scrape this into a blender and add the peanut butter, coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, hot chili oil, lime juice and a pinch of salt. Blend, adding the hot water a little at a time to thin it and make it smooth. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.To serve, put a bowl or ramekin of the peanut sauce in the center of a round serving plate. Arrange the skewers in a circular pattern around the bowl with the meat facing toward the center. Sprinkle with the cilantro.'
