S"For the meat: Rub the flank steak with oregano, cumin, salt and cracked pepper. Place the steak, beef stock, water, garlic, onion, bay leaves and peppercorns in a large pot, bring to a boil.  Simmer for 1 1/2 hours until meat is fork tender and comes easily apart with a fork. If you need to add some more liquid during the cooking process, go ahead.   Add more beef broth or water would be fine. Remove the pot off the burner and allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.When it\\'s cooled to room temperature, cover with lid and place into the refrigerator. Cool in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours.  After it\\'s cold, trim off any remaining fat, cut into 4 pieces across the grain and then shred using 2 forks.Place it back into the liquid until ready to serve. Before adding to the salad, drain off liquid and discard.For the vinaigrette: Whisk all the ingredients together, adding in the olive oil in a steady stream until incorporated.For the salad and assembly: Toss the lettuce and vegetables with the vinaigrette, and top with meat. Add freshly made corn tortilla chips around side of bowl."

S'For the brine: Combine the honey, salt, bay leaves, garlic, rosemary, thyme, red pepper flakes and 1 cup water in a large saucepot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and add the ice cubes. Place the turkey and brine into a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove from the brine and pat dry with paper towels.For the herb-roasted turkey breast: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Combine the garlic, parsley, rosemary, thyme, lemon zest, olive oil, salt and black pepper in a small mixing bowl and mix well. Rub the turkey all over with the herb-olive oil mixture to completely cover.Place the turkey in a large cast-iron skillet and roast for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees F and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F, 75 minutes to 90 minutes. Cover with foil if the turkey starts to get too dark. Let the turkey rest for 10 minutes. Reserve all the juices from the bottom of the skillet.Shred the turkey when cool enough to handle and reserve.For the grilled cremini mushrooms: Preheat a grill to high. Add the creminis, olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper to a medium mixing bowl and toss well to coat. Place the creminis on the grill and char on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Reserve the mushrooms.For the garlic butter: In a medium saucepan, combine the butter and garlic over medium heat and cook until the garlic becomes fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the parsley and mix well. Transfer to a small bowl and reserve.For the sandwiches: Increase the oven to 425 degrees F. In the same pan the turkey was roasted in, heat the flour and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat, whisking together to make a roux. Cook, whisking often, for 5 minutes. Stir in the wine, then add the cremini mushrooms and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the gravy is reduced by half, 12 to 15 minutes.Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and shredded turkey in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Let the turkey crisp in the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Lightly brush the rolls with the garlic butter and toast in the oven until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes.Spoon 1 tablespoon black truffle paste on a roll. Top with 2 ounces of the sliced truffle gouda laid from end to end, a quarter of the crisped turkey and some arugula. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the gravy over the roasted turkey. Make 3 more sandwiches with the remaining ingredients. Serve immediately with extra gravy on the side.'

S"For the puff pastry squares: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Carefully unfold the puff pastry and cut out twelve 3-by-3-inch squares. Line a half sheet tray with a nonstick silicon mat or spray with nonstick spray. Spread the squares out evenly on the half sheet tray, and lightly brush with the cream. Bake in the oven until golden and puffy, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the puffs to a wire rack to cool.For the orange sabayon: Combine the sugar and egg yolks in a large metal mixing bowl. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water (to create a double-boiler) and whisk until the yolks become pale yellow in color. Continue to whisk over low to medium heat until the mixture begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add the juices and zests and continue to whisk so the sauce thickens back up again. Add the liqueur and whisk until incorporated and the sabayon is light, fluffy and has good volume, 2 minutes longer.Assemble the raspberries and puff pastry together on a plate (if serving individual plates, allow 2 puffs per plate). Drizzle with the honey and pour the sabayon over and around the raspberries and puff pastry squares. Dust with the confectioners\\' sugar."

S'Preheat the grill to medium-high.Grill the corn until slightly charred black in some areas and has good color. Remove the corn from the grill to a cutting board and, using a serrated knife, cut the kernels off the cob. Set aside.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Add about 1/8-inch of bacon fat to a 10-inch cast iron skillet and put it in the oven to heat up. While this is going on, mix the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl add the cornmeal, reserving about 1/8 cup, the salt and the baking soda. When the oil is hot, remove the skillet from the oven and sprinkle the bottom with the reserved 1/8 cup of cornmeal. Stir it into the oil and return the skillet to the oven to brown the cornmeal. In a large bowl add the eggs, creme mexicana, corn, chiles, water, remaining bacon fat and the onions. When the cornmeal roux is nice and brown, remove the skillet from the oven and pour in half of the batter. It should sizzle a little in the hot bacon fat. Now sprinkle the goat cheese evenly across the top of the first layer of batter. Gently pour in the remaining batter, being careful not to upset the layers, and bake until the top is golden brown, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 minutes before serving'

Add 1 piece of meat, shake it around in the bag, remove it and repeat with the second piece of meat. Add the first piece back to the bag, seal and marinate as long as you can in the refrigerator -- 24 to 48 hours is recommended. But if you can\\'t wait, just go for it. It won\\'t be as over-the-top, but it will still be really good.Make the sour cream-horseradish sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, horseradish, garlic, sea salt, and pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.Twenty minutes before you plan on grilling, remove the meat from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature. Preheat a grill or a large grill pan to high.Grill the meat for 10 to 15 minutes (7 1/2 minutes per side), or until desired doneness. (It\\'s best at medium rare, about 140 degrees F or 145 degrees F.) Set the meat aside, cover and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.Slice the meat paper-thin with a knife or a countertop deli slicer. Divide the meat among 8 bread slices, spread some sour cream-horseradish sauce on each one, then add a few rings of onion slices and top with the rest of the bread.Photograph by Yunhee Kim"

S'Combine the cream, butter, sugar and vanilla extract in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Let the butter melt, then slowly simmer the cream until it reduces slightly, about 10 minutes. Be careful that the mixture doesnt boil over; if it does, reduce or remove from the heat.Break the bread up into 1-inch pieces. Day-old bread is best but any bread will work.  Place the bread in a large mixing bowl and set aside.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease an 8-inch-by-8-inch cake pan.Add the reduced heavy cream mixture to the bread pieces and mix until combined. Transfer to the prepared cake pan and sprinkle the kosher salt over the top. You want just a light sprinkle to give it that salty and sweet taste. Bake until firm in the middle, like brownies, about 20 minutes. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.This recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional and may have been scaled down from a bulk recipe.

S'For the seafood stuffing: Roughly chop the shrimp up into chunky pieces. Set a large saute pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and garlic. Once the garlic begins to sizzle, add the shrimp. Saute until just pink, about 2 minutes, and then add the crabmeat. Season with the cumin, paprika and some salt and pepper. Gently fold the mixture together, and then shut off the heat and add the lime juice. Allow to cool. Divide the mixture; you will use one half to stuff the tamales, and one half for the seafood sauce.For the tamales: Mix the masa, 1 1/4 cups water, butter and salt into a thick paste. To prepare the tamales, set a corn husk out on a flat surface (double up or shingle 2 husks if they are small or have tears). Add 5 tablespoons of the masa mix into the center of the corn husk. Push the mixture to 1 inch from the side of the husk. Add 2 tablespoons of seafood stuffing to the center. Fold one edge of the husk to the center, and then fold the other side to cover the entire tamale. Fold the ends over by 2 inches and tuck under to hold in place.Place a colander in large pot of boiling water, but do not let the colander touch the water. Place the tamales in the colander, cover and steam the tamales for 30 to 40 minutes.For the red seafood sauce: First, rehydrate the chile pepper. Place the dried chile in a cup of hot water and let sit for 10 minutes.Set a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and saute the fennel, onion and garlic until translucent and fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes. Deglaze with the white wine, and then simmer to evaporate some of the wine, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cumin, chile pepper, the water from the chile pepper and the can of tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Cook until the liquid reduces and the flavors come together, about 20 minutes. Blend until smooth with a stick blender, and then fold in the remaining half of the seafood stuffing. Taste and season once more if needed. Serve the red seafood sauce over the crab and shrimp tamales.'

S'For the sushi rice: In a large mixing bowl, rinse the rice by covering with cold water and straining. Repeat until the water runs clear, three times. Using a rice cooker on the highest setting or a medium saucepan over high heat, bring 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons water and the sushi rice to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Being careful not to disturb, turn off the heat and allow the rice to stand, covered, for an additional 15 minutes.For the sushi zu: Combine the sugar, vinegar and salt in a small saucepot. Heat just until dissolved.Remove the rice from the cooker or saucepan to a large glass or wooden bowl with a wooden paddle. Gently fold in the sushi zu. Bring the rice to room temperature and allow to rest for at least 1 hour covered with a towel.For the spicy tuna: Combine the Sriracha, mayo, sambal and sesame oil in a medium glass bowl with a whisk. Once incorporated, fold in the tuna and scallions. Mix thoroughly. Add in the chili powder, hot sesame oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready for use.For the vinaigrette: Whisk together the mustard, yuzu juice, wasabi, lemon zest and lime zest. Slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking to emulsify. Fold in the jalapeno. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve until ready for use.Form the sushi rice into nigiri patties, 2 tablespoons each. Bring the oil to 375 degrees F in large cast-iron or heavy-gauge pot over medium-high heat. Fry the tots until browned on all sides, crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oil and place on a towel-lined dish. Loosely cover to keep warm.To serve: Drizzle the serving plate with unagi sauce.  Place the fried nigiri tots on the plate, evenly spaced. Top each patty with 1 tablespoon spicy tuna salad. Garnish with a drizzle of yuzu vinaigrette.Warning: Consumption of raw or undercooked fish may substantially increase the risk of foodborne illness.'

Once cool enough to handle, finely chop.Heat the remaining teaspoon of canola oil in a saute pan over medium heat, add the onion and garlic and sweat until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook until lightened in color, 1 to 2 minutes.Combine the pepper mixture with the vinegar, lime juice, salt, paprika, and red pepper flakes in a food processor and pulse until combined. While the food processor is running, stream in the olive oil slowly to achieve a smooth puree, similar in to texture to ketchup. Set aside 1/3 of the sauce for serving.Place the steak and the remaining 2/3 of the sauce in a large re-sealable plastic bag; toss to coat and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, pat dry with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper. Grill the steak for 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let the steak rest for 10 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain. Serve with the reserved sauce on the side.'

S'For the chowchow: Combine the cider vinegar, sugar, celery seed, dry mustard, mustard seed, salt, turmeric and bay leaves in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then immediately lower to a simmer and cook for 5 to 10 minutes to extract all the flavors of the spices. Bring the liquid back to a boil and add the tomatillos, green tomatoes, garlic, jalapenos, red peppers, onions and cabbage. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are fully softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the chowchow to a bowl and let cool. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 1 month.For the pork chops: Set one pork chop in the center of a large cutting board. Cover the chop with a sheet of heavy plastic wrap. With a meat mallet, pound out the pork chop to an even 1/4-inch thickness, working from the middle out. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.Combine all of the panko in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. In another shallow dish combine the flour with the granulated garlic, onion powder, and some salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs with the half-and-half and add to a third shallow dish; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Take a pork chop and dip the meat (not the bone) into the flour, then into the egg, and finally into the panko, making sure the chop is well-breaded. Repeat for the remaining pork chops. Let the breaded pork chops rest for 5 to 10 minutes before cooking.Heat the canola oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add a pork chop to the hot oil and cook until golden brown on both sides, 4 minutes per side. Remove to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Repeat with the remaining pork chops, adding more oil as needed. Set the pork chops on plate and garnish with 3/4 cup of the chowchow, spooned over the center of each chop.'

S'1.\\tIn a meat grinder with a medium die, grind the chicken thighs to "chili grind," or have your butcher do it for you. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, 11/2 cups of the Ritz crackers, the black pepper, paprika, basil, cel-ery salt, cumin, white pepper, half the cayenne pepper, and 1 cup of the blue cheese. Mix well to incorporate. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.2.\\tPreheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Pour 2 inches of canola oil into a large, deep skillet and heat the oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Set a cooling rack over a baking sheet.3.\\tForm the chicken mixture into walnut-size balls and set them aside on a plate. Beat the egg in a shallow bowl and place the remaining 1 1/2 cups crackers in another bowl. Dip each ball in the egg and then roll it in the crackers, covering it thoroughly. Add the balls to the hot oil (in batches so as not to crowd them) and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. They cook very quickly, so working with a few at a time will help. As they finish cook-ing, place the balls on the rack over the baking sheet. When all the balls are fried, place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 10 minutes.1.\\tMeanwhile, in a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Add the garlic and jalapenos and cook  2 minutes. Stir in the hot sauce and keep warm over low heat.2.\\tTo serve, drizzle the hot sauce over the Buffalo balls or serve it as a dip on the side. Celery sticks and the remaining blue cheese make a cooling addition.'

S"Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.To make the pesto: Place all the ingredients in a food processor and process until mixture turns into a smooth paste. Set aside.To make the filling: In a saute pan over medium heat, add oil and then the sausage. Saute the sausage, breaking it up with a spoon, until it cooks through and it turns golden brown. Cool slightly and drain the fat. Set sausage aside in a bowl. Keep mozzarella and Asiago cheese on standby.To make the topping: Heat a large saute pan with oil, add the peppers, onion, granulated garlic and Italian seasoning. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and mushrooms and cook another 5 minutes. Don\\'t overcook the tomatoes. They should retain their shape. Set aside.To make the biscuit dough: In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the butter and with your fingertips or with a pastry blender blend together until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in milk, using a fork, until the dough comes together. Sprinkle flour on a clean work surface, remove the dough from the bowl and knead several times on the floured surface. Add small amounts of flour, as needed, so that dough will be easy to roll out. Roll the dough out to roughly 15-inches in diameter.To assemble: Sprinkle the top of the dough evenly with the sausage and top with the mozzarella and Asiago. Roll the dough into a log. Cut the ends off to create even edges then cut the log into 7 or 8 pieces, depending on the length of the roll. Place slices on a baking sheet and press the tops down.

S'Preheat a large saute pan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons butter and allow to melt. When the butter is melted and bubbling, add the chopped apple. Stir in the lemon juice and honey with a spatula to coat the apples. Continue to cook until the apples are golden, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes.  (If the apples get too brown, remove from the heat and set aside).In another large saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons butter and allow to melt. While the butter melts, mix together the flour, 2 teaspoons salt and the pepper in a large bowl. Dredge the chicken breasts in the flour mixture until thoroughly coated. Carefully place the dredged chicken into the heated pan and brown on each side, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken breasts to a baking sheet or oven-safe warming plate and cover with foil. Set aside.In the same saute pan, add the chicken stock and apple and cranberry juices to deglaze the pan. Add the cinnamon stick. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture, whisking to combine. Allow the sauce to reduce until it reaches a nice thick brown gravy consistency, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick.Add the cooked apples to the thickened sauce and whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the cooked chicken breasts to the apples and gravy, to reheat briefly (about 1 minute).  Plate the chicken breasts, top with the apples and sauce and sprinkle with the parsley.'

S'Mix 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F), the yeast and agave in a bowl. Set aside 5 minutes.In a food processor fitted with the dough blade, pulse the whole-wheat flour, 2 cups all-purpose flour and the sea salt. Add 1 egg and the yeast mixture and pulse in 10-second intervals until the dough comes together, about 3 pulses. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead 10 to 12 times, adding up to 3/4 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cut the dough into 4 equal portions; cover with a clean towel. On a floured board, roll out one piece of dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, with a shorter side facing you. Spread 2 1/2 tablespoons cream cheese across the middle of the dough; fold the bottom third of the dough over the cheese, then spread another 2 1/2 tablespoons cream cheese and 2 tablespoons pesto over the folded part. Fold the top third of the dough over the pesto. Reroll the dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle. Cut into seven 11-by-2-inch strips.One at a time, pinch the cut long edges of each strip together and roll into a 12-inch rope with your hands. Transfer the rope to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Grab the ends and bring them toward each other, forming a U shape, then cross the left end over the right end to make a pretzel shape. Cross the left end over the right again to make a twist in the middle. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough and the remaining cream cheese and pesto, spacing the pretzels 3 inches apart. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes; preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl. Brush the pretzels with the egg; sprinkle with coarse sea salt and dried basil. Bake until browned, 16 to 18 minutes, checking on the pretzels every 5 minutes to avoid overbaking.Photograph by Victor Schrager'

Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute more. Turn off heat, add in the corn and set aside. In a medium bowl, mash potatoes with a potato masher, and fold in the sour cream, cream cheese, pepper jack, salt and pepper.  Stir in 1/3 of the sliced green onions and combine gently with the corn mixture.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Keep warm. In a small saute pan, over medium heat, add the remaining olive oil. Add the remaining red bell peppers and saute briefly. Stir in 1/3 more of the green onions, then add the tomatillos.  Let simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, then puree with a stick blender. Keep warm.Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F and put a cooling rack on a sheet pan.  Heat the canola oil to 350 degrees F.  Have tortillas, dish of beans, potato mixture, sliced pasilla peppers, sliced avocado and toothpicks at hand, as well as a plate lined with paper towels for draining.Put a flour tortilla on dry work surface, lay about 3 tablespoons black beans along 1 side. Top with approximately 1/3 cup of the potato mixture, 2 strips of the pasilla pepper and avocado.Roll tightly, burrito style and seal with a toothpick. Set aside and repeat with remaining ingredients.When all are assembled, check the oil temperature and gently add them to the pan, maximum 4 at a time.  Do not crowd. Turn frequently and be careful, because they can brown quickly.  Drain briefly on paper towels, remove the toothpicks and keep warm in the oven on the cooling rack.Put 1/4 cup of tomatillo sauce on a plate; cut a flauta in half on the diagonal and lay 1 piece down, and 1 standing up, then sprinkle with Cotija cheese and cilantro. Garnish with the remaining green onions. Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients. For a main course, serve on large plate, double the sauce, add 4 cut pieces, all up, garnish and serve.'

S'In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until the fat has rendered and the bacon is crispy, 7 to 8 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon from the pan and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Reduce heat to medium, then add the flour to the fat in the pan and whisk until smooth. Cook, stirring often, until nutty and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.   Pour in the milk in a slow steady stream while whisking constantly. Whisk until smooth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 7 to 8 minutes.  Stir in the Brie, 1 teaspoon of the salt and the nutmeg, stirring until the Brie is melted. Add 3/4 of the bacon and stir to combine. Remove from the heat and keep warm while you prepare the cauliflower.Preheat a grill to medium high and wipe down the grates with a towel dipped in canola oil to clean and create a nonstick surface. Drizzle the cauliflower florets with olive oil and season with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Grill cauliflower until it is caramelized and charred on all sides, 7 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the grill and place on a large platter. While still hot, spoon the bacon and Brie mixture over the top. Garnish with the remaining crispy bacon and parsley.'

S'For the cioppino: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted towel to clean and create a nonstick surface.Squeeze the lemon halves (catching the seeds and discarding) into a large bowl, then add the lemon halves to the bowl as well. Add the wine, olive oil, capers, salt, chile flakes, peppers and garlic. Whisk to combine and set aside.Clean and cut the crabs: remove the hard shell, cut off the tail and discard the gills, then cut the halves into pieces so each piece has 2 to 3 legs. Place the crabs, scallops, shrimp and halibut in the marinade and gently toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, giving it a stir after 30 minutes.For the puree: Place the tomatoes, bell peppers, fennel and onions in a large gratin dish, and then drizzle with three tablespoons of the olive oil, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the fennel seeds and chile flakes and toss to coat everything evenly. Cut the top off of the bulb of garlic to expose the cloves. Place the garlic on a large piece of foil and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch each salt and pepper. Wrap up the foil into a tight pouch. Place the vegetables on the grill and the garlic pouch in the corner of the grill over indirect heat. Grill the vegetables on both sides until tender and charred around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Roast the garlic over direct heat until medium brown and paste-like, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the grill, cool enough to handle, then squeeze out the garlic paste from the bulb and set aside. Working in batches, add the vegetables and garlic paste to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until sauce-like in appearance and consistency. Transfer to a large saute pan set over medium heat. Stir and simmer until the sauce slightly thickens, 7 to 8 minutes. Add half of the basil and the ouzo, then remove from the heat and set aside.Grill the crab for 4 to 5 minutes, then flip and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Grill the shrimp for 3 to 4 minutes then flip and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Finally add the halibut and scallops to the grill; cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side then turn over and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove all the seafood from the grill to a platter.Serve the seafood family-style with the sauce generously ladled on top. Garnish with the remaining basil, the quartered lemons and the reserved fennel fronds.'

S"Prepare the roasted garlic: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cut the top 1/2 inch off the garlic heads and discard. Place the heads on a large piece of foil and drizzle with the olive oil. Wrap up foil tightly; place the package in a small baking dish. Roast until the garlic is soft and lightly browned, 1 hour.Meanwhile, prepare the tortilla cake: Combine the canola oil and onions in a large saute pan over medium heat. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring (don\\'t over brown). Add the butter and sugar; cook, stirring to caramelize. Remove from the heat and let cool.Once cooled, mix the onions with the parmesan, mayonnaise and cilantro in a bowl. Squeeze the roasted garlic out of their skins and stir into the onion mixture. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Set aside 1/3 of the onion mixture in the refrigerator for the dipping sauce. Spread 2 tablespoons of the remaining mixture on top of a tortilla and cover with another tortilla. Repeat, spreading and stacking the tortillas; finish with a tortilla with no mixture on top. Wrap the tortilla stack in plastic wrap and let set up for 12 to 24 hours in the refrigerator.After the stack has set up, cut into 16 wedges. Preheat a grill or grill pan; warm wedges over medium heat until both sides are marked. Combine the reserved onion mixture with the balsamic vinegar to make the dipping sauce.Photograph by James Baigrie"

S'Peel the sides of the potatoes, leaving the skin on both ends. Cut them into 3/8-inch slices, then stack the pieces and dice them into 3/8-inch squares. Put the potatoes in a bowl with the water and let them sit submerged for 30 minutes to 24 hours. This will help leach the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing.Heat the oil in a heavy stock pot to 275 to 300 degrees F. Use a candy thermometer to assure proper temperature. Drain the potatoes and pat them dry of excess water. Add about 2 handfuls of the potatoes to the hot oil. (Chefs Note: There should be at least 1-inch of oil covering the potatoes.)  Cook until they are partially cooked and lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove the potatoes, shake off any excess oil and let them cool on a rack.  Repeat with the remaining potatoes.After all of the potatoes have cooled, heat the oil to 350 degrees F.  Add 2 handfuls of the potatoes to the oil, and fry until they are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove them from the pot, shake off the excess oil, and season lightly in a bowl with the salt and pepper.  Repeat this method until all the potatoes are fried. Keep warm until ready to use.'

Add in the diced cold butter, 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/8 teaspoon ginger, and pulse at 3 to 4 second intervals for 6 to 10 times until the mixture resembles sand. Add in the butter milk and pulse until a dough ball forms. Remove from the food processor onto a lightly floured board. Roll the dough into an oval, approximately 16 by 14 inches. Rough edges are okay, but you can trim decoratively if desired. Transfer to a silicone or parchment lined baking sheet.In a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, and the remaining spices and mix well. Toss this flour mixture with the pears, gently coating. Pile the pear mix in the center of the tart dough, leaving a 3 to 4-inch border, and then fold the edges up and around the pears, leaving an opening in the center. Crimp any breaks in the dough.  Place the baking sheet with tart into the refrigerator for 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Brush with the melted butter and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar.

Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F.Lightly dredge each piece of the provolone in flour. Working in batches, dip the provolone rounds into the batter, then shake off any excess and place in the hot oil. Fry until lightly browned and puffy on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the provolone and season with some salt. Repeat for the remaining rounds of provolone.Cut the crispy provolone into wedges and place on a large serving platter. Garnish with the parsley and serve with the Italian salsa spooned over the top or on the side for dipping.'

Drain on a paper towel lined plate.Dust a flat surface with flour and roll out the pizza dough until it is 1/4 of an inch thick.Place the sliced potatoes on top of the pizza dough so that the entire surface is covered, drizzle olive oil over the top of the potatoes and place in the oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the potatoes start to brown.Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle with the cooked pancetta, red bell peppers, red pepper flakes and both cheeses. Place the pizza back in the oven and cook for about 7 more minutes until all of the cheese has melted and the top of the pizza begins to brown.Remove the pizza from the oven and garnish with cracked black pepper and chopped basil.Let the pizza sit for a couple of minutes before cutting, drizzle with lime juice and sprinkle with lime zest.

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and a cast-iron griddle to medium-high heat.For the Mornay sauce: In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, add the butter and sweat the onions until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the flour and toast for an additional minute without adding color. Bring the skillet to medium-high heat. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Stir to incorporate and simmer for 3 minutes. Add the milk and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer until the starch has cooked out and the sauce has thickened, an additional 3 minutes. Add the nutmeg to taste. Reduce the heat to low. Stir in the Cheddar and Parmesan. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Season with salt and pepper.For the sandwich: Melt the butter and mix with the garlic. Brush one side of the slices of the sourdough with the garlic butter. Griddle the toast on both sides until golden brown and toasted. Remove from the heat. Transfer to a baking sheet, garlic-butter-side up, and season with the flake salt.Top the toast slices with about 1 1/2 ounces of turkey and 2 slices of bacon. Shingle the tomato slices over the bacon and turkey. Spoon approximately 1 ounce of Mornay sauce over the top and sprinkle with Parmesan. Place in the oven and toast until the Parmesan bubbles, about 5 minutes (finish under the broiler if desired). Remove and garnish with the scallions. Serve open face, 2 per serving.'

S"For the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, stir together the panko and milk and set aside.Place the brisket and sirloin on a baking sheet and transfer to the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to firm up. (This will make grinding cleaner and easier.) Grind the meat in a food processor or bench top grinder, following manufacturer\\'s instructions. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate the ground beef until ready to use.Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, celery, poblano and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the onions turn translucent. Add the cumin, oregano and ancho powder and cook for another 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and set aside to cool to room temperature. When cool, add the ground beef, the chorizo, the milk-soaked panko, and the egg, black beans and corn. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix until just combined (don\\'t overwork the meat). Transfer the meatloaf mixture to a parchment-lined baking sheet and shape into a free-form loaf. Bake until the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 minutes to 1 hour.Meanwhile, make the pesto: In a food processor, combine the cilantro, parsley, pepitas, cumin, garlic and some salt and pepper. Pulse to a coarse paste; then slowly drizzle in the olive oil, while pulsing. Transfer the pesto to a bowl and fold in the cotija and Parmesan. Set aside.When the meatloaf is done, remove it from the oven and immediately spread some of the pesto over the top. Tent with foil and let rest for 10 minutes.For the tortilla strips: Fill a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven with 2 inches of oil, and heat the oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Working in batches, fry the tortilla strips until golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Season with salt.To serve: Cut the meatloaf into thick slices. Top with a dollop of cilantro pesto and some crispy tortilla strips. Serve."

S'To make the croquettes: In a large saucepan over low heat, add the milk and a large pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, add the cauliflower and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Remove the cauliflower from the pot, place in a bowl and pat dry with a towel. Toss the cauliflower with 2 tablespoons butter and put into a food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times. Let the mixture cool slightly and add 1 egg, Parmesan, parsley, nutmeg, salt and pepper, to taste, and pulse to combine. Remove to a large bowl, then add 1 cup of the bread crumbs and stir. There should be enough bread crumbs to hold the mixture together to form into balls. If the mixture is too wet add a little more panko. Heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven.Form the mixture into 2-inch round balls and set aside on a plate. Place the flour, 2 whisked eggs, and remaining panko into 3 separate bowls and season each with a little salt and pepper. Place each of the croquettes into the flour then the egg wash and then the panko.Place the croquettes into the oil, in batches if necessary, and fry until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the croquettes with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and place on a serving dish.To make the aioli: Place garlic, lemon juice, zest, and egg yolks in a blender or food processor. Blend until the ingredients are combined. With the machine running, remove the lid and slowly drizzle in the olive oil. When well combined, taste for seasoning, adjust if necessary, then add the peppadews and pulse until aioli is speckled with them, but not fully blended. Remove the aioli to a small serving bowl and serve with the Cauliflower Croquettes.*RAW EGG WARNINGFood Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggsDue to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.  To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell.'

Carefully add potatoes to oil making sure that aren\\'t stuck together. Cook potatoes, gently stirring with tongs or a strainer, until golden brown and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined sheet pan and immediately sprinkle with a pinch of the sea salt and pepper and 1 teaspoon Gruyere.

Place a 12-inch cast-iron skillet adjacent to the coals to heat up.Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, milk, egg, and melted butter. Make a well in the dry ingredients and slowly stir the wet ingredients into the dry, mixing gently until the lumps are dissolved. Fold in the cheese, poblanos, and corn.Remove the cast-iron skillet from the fire and put the 2 tablespoons butter in the hot pan so it sizzles. Roll the butter around the pan to coat it evenly, then pour the cornbread batter into the hot skillet. Top with a lid and place back in the spot adjacent to the coals. Using a metal shovel, place hot coals on top of the lid and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the bread is golden and firm. Rotate the pan every 7 to 8 minutes so the cornbread cooks evenly. Carefully remove the coals and lid and let the cornbread cool slightly in the pan, about 5 minutes. Slice and serve warm.Conventional Cooking method:Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, uncovered."

In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter, add onions, celery and peppers, when translucent and just starting to caramelize, add in garlic and saute briefly, add in rice and saute, stirring frequently to coat kernels with the oil for 2 minutes. Slowly start adding in the hot chicken stock 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly on medium-low heat. Continue this method until chicken stock remaining is about 1 cup and check for the consistency of the rice. It should be creamy with a tiny bit of resistance to the grain. Turn off heat, drain peas well, and slowly fold into risotto, adding the 2 tablespoons of remaining butter, Parmesan and salt and pepper, to taste. If risotto is too thick, gently stir in the remaining chicken stock to desired consistency. Heat reserved bacon fat in a saute pan, stir in greens, allowing them to wilt, when almost wilted, add in 4 tablespoons vinegar, when wilted, add in bacon, zest and salt and pepper to taste.Place risotto on serving plate(s) and top with the Southern Greens, dress with reserved tablespoon of vinegar and the extra-virgin olive oil. Garnish with a sprinkle of Parmesan.'

S'Prepare the brine: In a large soup pot, bring 8 cups water to a boil. Add the kosher salt, peppercorns and garlic; remove from heat. Let cool 30 minutes, then transfer to a large pot or ice chest lined with a large garbage bag. Add another 8 cups water, then add the wings and twist the bag closed. Refrigerate for 4 hours.  Mix all the rub ingredients in a resealable plastic bag. Drain the wings. Rinse under cool water, pat very dry and put in the bag with the rub. Mix to coat evenly. Seal the bag and refrigerate until ready to cook. (You can do this a day ahead.) Preheat the broiler. Remove the wings from the bag and place in a single layer on a lightly oiled foil-lined pan. Broil for 8 minutes, then turn and cook for an additional 5 to 8 minutes, or until crisp and golden.Meanwhile, combine all the ingredients for the salsa, except the olive oil, in a food processor, using salt to taste. Slowly add the oil and puree until smooth. Serve the wings with the salsa.'

S'Begin by charring the poblano chile peppers. Using tongs, place the peppers directly over an open flame on the stove top. Char all over, about 2 minutes per side, and then place in a bowl covered tightly with plastic wrap so they sweat. Leave to sit for 5 minutes, and then use a paper towel to remove the charred outer layer. Discard the stem and seeds, and then dice the peppers.Set a large Dutch oven over high heat and add the butter and olive oil. Add the turkey, onions and garlic and cook, breaking up into small pieces, until lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the flour and season with the cumin, onion powder, paprika and some salt and pepper. The flour will form a roux with the fat in the pan. Cook for 2 minutes while stirring, and then add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add the heavy cream and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and fold in diced chile peppers and corn. Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling, salted water until al dente, about 12 minutes.Fold the pasta into the turkey sauce and season with salt and pepper, stirring until thoroughly combined. Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.In a large mixing bowl, prepare the topping by combining the panko, Parmigiano-Reggiano, olive oil and garlic. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine everything well. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs evenly on top of the pasta. Place the whole dish on a sheet tray (to catch any spill over) and place in the oven to bake until the breadcrumbs are golden and the sauce is bubbly around the edges, about 35 minutes.For garnishes, stir the lime zest together with creme fraiche. Dice the tomatoes and roughly chop the parsley.'

S'In a stand mixer, fitted with the dough blade, add the butter and sugar and mix until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes.  Add in the yolks, 1 at a time, then add the vanilla and combine well.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and gently fold in the flour. Stir in the cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough just comes together.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.Lemon Curd:  In a double boiler over medium-high heat, add all of the custard ingredients and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and reaches 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove from heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl. Cover the bowl, pressing plastic wrap onto the top of the custard and refrigerate until cool, about 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it rest for 15 minutes (less if it is a hot day).  Roll out on a silicone mat to 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick.  Cut and press into the tart pans. Chefs Note: You can cut shapes out of the scraps to decorate or nibble on. Just brush the shapes with egg wash, sprinkle with a little tubinado sugar and bake until golden, about 10 minutes.Prick the bottom of the tarts with a fork and refrigerate for 15 minutes.Put the tarts on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cool before filling.If using, whip the heavy whipping cream in a large bowl until stiff peaks form.Fill the shells with about 3 tablespoons of the curd and arrange fruit as desired on top.  Garnish with a small dollop of the whipped cream and serve immediately.  Can be made 20 to 30 minutes in advance and kept in refrigerator.'

S"Camping sandwiches can be prepared ahead of time and made in either square or circular presses-both work fine. Depending on your make and model, adjust the filling amounts so the sandwiches are full but not too full (or they\\'ll ooze while being toasted). The fillings can vary, and it\\'s a good way to utilize leftover chili, mac-n- cheese, and other ingredients when camping.For circular sandwiches, punch out the bread into 4-inch circles or the size of your sandwich press.Prepare a campfire with wood and wait until the flames die down and the coals glow red with white ash. Place a grilling rack so that it sits just above the coals. Place the presses on the grill so they heat up.Assemble each sandwich with the desired fillings, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Remove the presses from the hot grill, open, and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place a sandwich in each press (it will sizzle-this preheating helps it form a nice crispy crust) and close tightly. Place on the grill and cook for 1 or 2 minutes per side. You can check the sandwich as it cooks by opening the press and checking the color-it should be golden brown and crispy on both sides when done. (Depending on how hot your coals are, you can also place the press directly on coals to make it cook faster-just keep an eye on it!)Be sure to use room temperature (versus cold) ingredients in the filling-otherwise lower the flame and toast the sandwich for a longer amount of time to sufficiently warm the filling."

S'For the tahini-yogurt sauce: In a bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, tahini, salt, lemon zest and juice and 1 tablespoon water. Cover and reserve in the refrigerator.For the pickled turnips: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 1/2 cups water with the cider vinegar, brown sugar, salt, bay leaves, garlic, beets and turnips. Bring to a quick boil to dissolve the sugar. Set aside to cool, then refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve the turnips only; discard the beets, bay leaves and pickling brine.For the garlic butter: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and garlic and cook until fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the parsley and mix well. Set aside in a small bowl.For the lamb kofta burger: Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat.In a medium mixing bowl, add the ground lamb, garlic, onion, parsley, allspice, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Mix all the ingredients together to evenly distribute the spices, being careful not to overmix. Divide into six equal portions and shape into a round, tight patties, about 4 inches wide.Place the patties on the grill, spaced 3 inches apart to prevent flare ups. Grill for 3 minutes on the first side to develop a crust. Flip, and cook on the second side until medium-well, 2 minutes. Set aside.Brush the cut sides of the brioche buns lightly with garlic butter and toast on the grill until golden and crisp, 5 to 10 seconds. Flip, and toast the outsides until lightly toasted, another 5 to 10 seconds.To assemble: Layer the bottom buns with a burger, some tahini sauce, pickled turnips, lettuce, tomato and onion.

S'Prepare the lollipops: With a knife or kitchen shears, cut the skin and tendons around the bottom (the narrow end) of each drummette. Use a paring knife to scrape the meat from to bottom toward the top of the bone to form a lollipop shape; make sure the bone is scraped completely clean.Make the brine: To a saucepan, add 1 1/2 cups water and the vinegar, honey, salt, soy sauce, peppercorns, pepper flakes, garlic, star anise, bay leaf and ginger. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Pour the brine into a large bowl and add 1 1/2 cups ice to cool it down quickly. Add the chicken lollipops to the brine, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Remove the chicken and pat dry.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Prepare the dry rub: In a large bowl, combine the five-spice powder, garlic, ginger, mustard, paprika, salt and cayenne. Mix well to blend. Set aside 1 tablespoon of the rub for later use in sauce, then add the chicken and coat thoroughly with the rub.Arrange the chicken on a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the skin begins to turn golden. (This helps render some of the fat, so the drummettes fry up nice and crispy.) Remove from oven and set aside.While the drummettes are cooking, prepare the sauce: To a medium saute pan, add the sweet soy sauce, vinegar, fish sauce, honey, pepper flakes and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook until the sauce has reduced by a third or so, about 10 minutes. Stir in the reserved tablespoon of the dry rub and keep warm while you fry the wings.Fill a large, heavy pot with 2 to 3 inches of oil, and heat to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Working in batches, fry the chicken wings in the oil until brown and crispy, 6 to 7 minutes. With a spider or slotted spoon, remove the fried chicken to a large mixing bowl. Add the sauce to the chicken and toss to coat.Transfer the chicken lollipops to a serving platter and garnish with the red pepper, scallions, cilantro and sesame seeds.'

If the puree is too thick, add a tablespoon or 2 of the chile soaking liquid to thin to desired consistency.Place the lamb in a roasting dish and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Pour the puree on top, cover and marinate in the fridge for 3 to 4 hours.Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Thaw the banana leaves (if frozen) by running them under warm water. Line a turkey roaster or braising dish with the banana leaves, slightly overlapping them on one another.Remove the lamb from the marinade and place on the banana leaves. Wrap up the lamb with the banana leaves, tucking in the edges so it is completely covered. Add 1 1/2 cups water to the baking dish, then cover the entire pan with aluminum foil.Bake until the meat is tender and falling apart, 4 hours. Remove the foil and open the banana leaves.

S'For the pineapple: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Begin by peeling the pineapple and cutting it into 1/2-inch-thick planks approximately 2 by 2 inches wide; discard the core. Arrange in a single layer in a roasting pan. Whisk together 1/2 cup water, the rum, sugar, vanilla and salt, and then pour over the pineapple. Sprinkle the top with a little extra sugar, if desired, then roast until caramelized, 17 to 18 minutes. When done, remove the pineapple from the pan and allow to cool slightly before dicing.For the pecans: Arrange the pecans in a baking sheet and toast until slightly darkened and fragrant, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before adding the butter to the baking sheet. Immediately toss the baking sheet to coat the pecans as the butter melts. Sprinkle evenly with the sugar and salt and toss once more. Set aside on a plate to cool.To assemble, place 2 to 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream in a bowl. Top with 2 to 3 spoonfuls of rum-roasted pineapple and garnish with sugared pecans.'

S'Preheat a clean, seasoned grill to high heat.Grill the chiles and bell peppers until charred all over, 3 to 4 minutes per side, then immediately them to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap to steam for 10 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel and discard the blackened skins and remove the stems and seeds. Finely dice the peppers and set aside.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Pour 4 1/2 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt in a heavy-bottomed pot set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. In a slow, steady stream, add the cornmeal while whisking vigorously to incorporate and smooth out lumps. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring continuously for the first 2 to 3 minutes. Cook the polenta until thick, and it begins to pull away from the sides of the pot, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the diced peppers, the Pecorino-Romano and butter.Grease a quarter-sheet tray with the oil. Pour the polenta on the prepared sheet tray and smooth out the top with a rubber spatula. Bake until golden brown and bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for 1 hour.Cut the polenta into squares, then brush the squares with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the polenta on both sides to create grill marks and heat through, 3 to 5 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve.'

S'1. For the crust: Combine the flour, margarine, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Work with your fingers gathering and crumbling until you have a crumbly mixture about the size of peas.2. In 2-tablespoon amounts (about 1/2 cup total), slowly add cold water, gently incorporating by hand. As soon as the dough comes together in a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.3. For the filling: Mix together the goat cheese, heavy cream, egg, brown sugar, flour, salt, and basil in a bowl. Add the blueberries and combine; the texture will be like a thick cake batter.4. For the topping: Mix together the almonds, sugar, and margarine in a bowl and set aside.5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to 18-inch thickness and place into a 10-inch pie pan. Trim and crimp the edges and prick the bottom of the crust with a fork. Par-bake the crust for 15 minutes, or until firm. Let cool slightly. Pour the filling into the crust and sprinkle the topping over the top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until slightly bubbling and the crust is browned, rotating the pie halfway through. Let the pie cool for 30 minutes on a wire rack before serving so the filling can firm up.'

S'For the vegetables: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Trim the stems off the beets and lightly scrub with a vegetable brush - this will remove the tough outer layer. Quarter the beets and set aside. Trim the carrots (leaving a little of the stem on), and then cut in half crosswise. Add all the vegetables and the potatoes to a roasting pan along with the garlic head halves. Drizzle with the olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until golden brown and tender, about 45 minutes (the tip of a paring knife should pierce a potato and go through with little resistance).For the spicy pepitas: In a large mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, chili powder, cumin and some salt and pepper. Add the pepitas and mix well so they are evenly coated. Toast in the oven until the pepitas are lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.For the horseradish creme fraiche: Stir together the creme fraiche and horseradish and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.To serve, place the roasted root vegetables on a large platter. Drizzle with the horseradish creme fraiche and garnish with spicy pepitas.'

Transfer to a mixing bowl and set aside.For the Venetian vinaigrette: Combine the vinegar, garlic, lemon zest and juice in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk in the oil slowly to emulsify. Once thickened, whisk in the parsley, cilantro, oregano and scallions. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate in an airtight container until ready for use (or up to 48 hours).For the court bouillon: Place 12 cups cold water, the celery, carrot, onion, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, chili, lemon and black peppercorns into a large stockpot fitted with a fine mesh colander attachment. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Poach by placing the calamari and the shrimp into the colander and simmering until the calamari is firm and the shrimp is pink, about 3 minutes. Remove to a mixing bowl and set aside. Poach the clams until the shells open, 4 to 6 minutes.Transfer the clams to the already poached shellfish, discarding any unopened shells. Add the sliced tomato to the shellfish. Toss with two-thirds of the vinaigrette, season and refrigerate until chilled, about 10 minutes.For the salad: Gently toss the arugula and fennel in a large mixing bowl with the remaining vinaigrette to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large serving dish. Arrange the marinated seafood atop the salad. Garnish with the diced tomatoes, scallions, lemon wedges and fennel fronds around the platter.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the chicken brine: Combine 1 cup water, the honey, salt, bay leaves, garlic and thyme in a large saucepot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once at a boil, turn off the heat and add the ice cubes. Place the chicken and brine into a large resealable gallon plastic bag. Refrigerate, brining the chicken, for 1 hour.For the honey glaze: In a small saucepot over medium-low heat, whisk the honey, vinegar and orange juice until just simmering. Remove from the heat and set aside at room temperature until ready to use.For the chicken: Once brined, remove the chicken quarters from the bag and pat dry. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and pepper and place skin-side down into a cast-iron pan. Place into the oven. Roast until the internal temperature reads 155 degrees F, about 50 minutes, flipping halfway through the baking time. Remove from the oven, brush the chicken with the honey glaze, and then return to the oven. Finish roasting the chicken until the skin is crispy and the internal temperature reads 165 degrees F, about 15 minutes. Remove the chicken and allow to rest about 10 minutes. Reserve the pan drippings.For the gravy: To the same cast-iron pan, over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. Add the mushrooms, garlic and shallots, and toss to combine. Allow to soften, being careful not to burn. Season with salt and pepper. Add the flour and whisk to incorporate with the fat. Continue cooking out the starch for about 2 minutes. Add the white wine and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Reduce for about 1 minute. Add the chicken stock and reduce by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and drizzle in some truffle oil. Swirl in the butter. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange the chicken pieces on a serving dish, finishing with the truffle gravy.'

S'Make the aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice, mustard and garlic in a food processor and process until combined. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate 1 hour before serving.Meanwhile, prepare the mushrooms: In a shallow pan, soak the mushroom strips in the buttermilk, about 1 hour.Make the batter: In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks, beer, flour, cornmeal, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and the cayenne. Fill a large deep pot with about 1 1/2 inches peanut oil; heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F.In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with a mixer until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter. One at a time, dip the mushroom strips in the batter, then carefully lower into the hot oil. (Do this in batches if necessary-do not crowd the pot.) Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, turning with tongs. Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with sea salt and serve with the garlic aioli.Photograph by Con Poulos'

S'Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Bring a large cast-iron grill pan to medium-high heat.Pat the steak dry and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil. Place the steak into the pan and sear until browned (without moving the steak), 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the steak over and cook a further 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. Remove the steak from the pan and add to a cast-iron pan. Put the steak into the oven for 5 minutes to finish cooking through. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest on a plate while you prepare the sauce.Place the cast-iron pan over medium heat and add the oil to heat. Once heated, add the shallots to the pan. Saute until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the thyme leaves, and then remove the pan from flame (for safety purposes) and add the brandy. Ignite the brandy by returning to the stove top and tilting the pan toward the open flame, or carefully lighting with a lighter or match. Once the flames subside, add the cream and swirl to incorporate. Add the peppercorns and simmer the sauce until it has reduced by two-thirds to a smooth, slightly thick consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Add any pan drippings to the sauce. Season with salt, if needed. To finish, remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the butter.To serve, slice the rested hanger steak into 1/2-inch strips, against the grain, and serve with a drizzle of brandied green peppercorn sauce over the top.'

S'In a large mixing bowl, combine the salt and pepper. Place the turkey legs in a large re-sealable bag and add the salt mixture. Shake around to coat the legs evenly and then seal bag and place in fridge overnight.Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, add 1/4 cup duck fat. Remove the turkey legs from the bag and brush off excess salt. Add the turkey legs to the pot and brown all over, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add the garlic and shallots and cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the thyme, cloves, rosemary, star anise, fennel seeds, cinnamon, lemon peel and orange peel and then pour over the remaining duck fat so the legs are completely covered.Bring to a gentle simmer (without boiling or frying), then remove from the heat, cover and place into the oven. Cook until the meat starts to fall off the bone, about 3 hours.Place the legs on a baking sheet. Shred the meat and serve. Reserve the fat and use it to cook gravy, French fries or roasted potatoes. If making ahead of time, remove the pot from the oven and set aside to allow the turkey to cool in the fat. Once cooled, place in the refrigerator overnight to completely chill. To serve, remove the turkey from the fat and crisp in a dry pan to heat through.'

S'Mix 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F), the yeast and agave in a bowl. Set aside 5 minutes.In a food processor fitted with the dough blade, pulse the whole-wheat flour, 2 cups all-purpose flour and the sea salt. Add 1 egg and the yeast mixture and pulse in 10-second intervals until the dough comes together, about 3 pulses. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead 10 to 12 times, adding up to 3/4 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cut the dough into 4 equal portions; cover with a clean towel. On a floured board, roll out one piece of dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, with a shorter side facing you.  Spread 1 tablespoon mustard across the middle of the dough. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Swiss cheese. Fold the bottom third of the dough over the cheese, then sprinkle another 1/4  cup Swiss cheese, 1/3 cup ham and 2 tablespoons chives over the folded part. Fold the top third of the dough over the cheese, ham and chives. Reroll the dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle. Cut into seven 11-by-2-inch strips.One at a time, pinch the cut long edges of each strip together and roll into a 12-inch rope with your hands. Transfer the rope to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Grab the ends and bring them toward each other, forming a U shape, then cross the left end over the right end to make a pretzel shape. Cross the left end over the right again to make a twist in the middle. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough and the remaining mustard, cheese, ham and chives, spacing the pretzels 3 inches apart. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes; preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl. Brush the pretzels with the egg; sprinkle with smoked sea salt. Bake until browned, 16 to 18 minutes, checking on the pretzels every 5 minutes to avoid overbaking.

S"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a 14-cup Bundt pan with nonstick spray.For the cake: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl regularly. With the mixer on low, add the eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Add the sour cream, orange zest and vanilla, and then mix until smooth.  Sift together the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder. Fold in half the sifted dry ingredients, and then half the milk. Mix together, and then add the remaining dry ingredients and milk.Scrape the batter into the greased Bundt pan and bake in the center of the oven for 1 hour. When done, a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake will come out clean. Cool in the cake pan for 10 minutes before inverting and carefully removing the cake from the pan.For the cherry sauce: Combine the cherries with 1/3 cup water, confectioners\\' sugar, rum, vanilla, lemon peel, lemon juice, orange juice and cinnamon stick in a medium saucepan. Simmer until the cherries are tender and the sauce is lightly syrupy (it will thicken further when cooled), 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, discard the lemon peel and cinnamon stick. Add the butter and stir to combine and melt. Serve with the sliced chocolate Bundt cake."

S'Begin by pounding out the veal chops. Place the chops between two pieces of plastic wrap and gently pound from the bone out until they each are an even 1/4 inch thick.In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, granulated garlic and pepper. Dredge the veal chops in the seasoned flour and shake to remove excess flour.Working with a large (12-inch) cast-iron pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the oil over medium-high heat. Cook the veal chops until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and set aside.Reduce the heat to low and deglaze the pan with the white wine. Scrape up any brown bits and simmer the wine until reduced by half. Add the chicken stock and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Add the capers and garlic to the pan and saute until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Add the reduced sauce back to the pan and bring back to a simmer.Just before serving, add the lemon juice and a touch of red wine vinegar and turn off the heat. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the parsley. Taste and season as needed.Serve the chops on a large rimmed plate covered with the sauce and garnished with the Parmesan.'

In a clean microwavable glass bowl, melt bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate together in the microwave at 50 percent power or in a double boiler. Set aside.In a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar on medium speed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, combining well. Add in the vanilla and rum. Stir the rhubarb into the chocolate mixture, then add to the batter. Mix until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix just until incorporated. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and gently fold in the semisweet chocolate and walnuts. Do not over mix. Spray an 8 by 8 by 2-inch clear glass baking dish with shortening spray. Line bottom with parchment paper, then spray parchment.  Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth out top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 to 40 minutes.

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.For the tapenade: In a food processor, combine the olives, red peppers, raisins, capers, parsley, orange zest, tarragon and black pepper. Pulse six or seven times, just until roughly chopped. Pour in the olive oil and pulse 2 or 3 times to incorporate; the mixture should have the consistency of a coarse puree. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.For the cauliflower steaks: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat.Remove the green outer leaves from the cauliflower heads, leaving the cores intact. Set the cauliflowers on their base and halve them vertically (a serrated knife works well for this). Then slice each half, vertically again, into 1-inch steaks; the core will hold them together. You should end up with four nice steaks; reserve the ends for another use.Generously coat the steaks on both sides with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the steaks for 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and well-marked. Remove to a foil-lined baking sheet.In a small bowl, mix together the Parmesan, panko, parsley, garlic and pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the breading on top of the cauliflower steaks and drizzle with some olive oil. Transfer to the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve the steaks topped with spoonfuls of the tapenade.'

Cut the chocolate babka into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Spread out evenly on a baking sheet and bake until browned around the edges, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.  Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 9 by 13-inch baking dish.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs and granulated sugar until combined.  Add the toasted babka and rum and cherries and mix well. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.  Place on a baking sheet (to catch any spillover) and bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes; the pudding is done when lightly browned around the edges and the mixture springs back when pressed gently in the center. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.In a medium bowl, combine the heavy cream, confectioners sugar, orange zest and vanilla. Beat until soft peaks form. Serve bread pudding warm with dollops of whipped cream on top and garnished with shaved chocolate.'

S'For the octopus: Place cleaned octopus and flakey salt into a stand mixer with the hook attachment. Beat the octopus on the lowest speed until the tentacles curl and can be separated, 15 to 20 minutes; this tenderizes the meat. Remove the octopus from the mixer, rinse under cold running water in a colander, drain and pat dry. Cover and refrigerate until ready for use.For the vinaigrette: Combine and whisk together the vinegar, garlic, Simple Preserved Lemons, Meyer lemon zest and juice in a medium glass mixing bowl. Slowly add and whisk in the oil until completely incorporated and smooth. Add the basil and gently whisk. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready for use.For the salad: Preheat the grill to high heat. Separate the tentacles and head of the octopus. Skewer each leg, weaving the legs through the skewers. Using tongs and an oil-blotted paper towel, wipe down the grill grates to clean and create a nonstick surface. Drizzle the octopus with a few tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper. Place the octopus onto the hot grill and sear. Allow to char around the edges then turn, 3 to 4 minutes per side. The octopus is done when just cooked through yet nicely charred around the edges. Do not overcook or it will be tough. Remove and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut the octopus tentacles and head into bite-size pieces, and then toss with about 3 tablespoons of the lemon vinaigrette. Set aside.Toss the arugula, white beans, chile, radishes and red onions with the remaining vinaigrette. Add the warm octopus and carefully toss to combine. Season with flakey sea salt and pepper. Serve immediately, garnishing with more preserved lemon, if desired, and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.'

Add the ribs in batches, so as not to crowd.  Brown them deeply on each side and when all have been seared, remove them from the pot and add 1/3 of the beer to deglaze. Turn off the heat and scrape the fond from the bottom of the pan.Sauce: Strain the fat from the Dutch oven, leaving the juices and return the pot to medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, cook for 2 minutes more, then add both cans of the drained cherries.  Bring to a simmer, add the chipotle paste and molasses and adjust seasonings, if needed.  Reduce the mixture for 10 minutes at a simmer.  At this point you can strain for a more elegant sauce, then add the butter, or just add the butter and leave rustic.Put the beef ribs back in the pot, stir to combine with the onions and shallots, and pout in the remaining beer and sherry. Cover and roast, turning the ribs every 40 minutes. After 3 hours, drizzle in the molasses, return the lid and roast for 1 hour more.Transfer the ribs and the sauce to a serving dish and serve.'

Bring to a boil, then maintain at a simmer while making the risotto.For the risotto: Add the olive oil to a large heavy-bottomed saucepan set over medium-high heat. When hot add the barley and saute until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the shallots, garlic, Vidalia onions and salt; cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the shallots become translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the shiitakes and thyme leaves and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Next, begin adding the vegetable stock, one ladleful at a time, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. Stir frequently throughout; this brings out the starch in the barley. When the barley is tender and all of the vegetable stock has been used, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the butter, Parmesan and pepper. Transfer to a serving platter and garnish with the parsley. Serve immediately.'

S'Mix 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F), the yeast and agave in a bowl. Set aside 5 minutes.In a food processor fitted with the dough blade, pulse the whole-wheat flour, 2 cups all-purpose flour and the sea salt. Add 1 egg and the yeast mixture and pulse in 10-second intervals until the dough comes together, about 3 pulses. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead 10 to 12 times, adding up to 3/4 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cut the dough into 4 equal portions; cover with a clean towel. On a floured board, roll out one piece of dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, with a shorter side facing you.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cheddar across the middle of the dough; fold the bottom third of the dough over the cheese, then sprinkle another 2 tablespoons cheddar over the folded part. Fold the top third of the dough over the cheese. Reroll the dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle. Cut into seven 11-by-2-inch strips.One at a time, pinch the cut long edges of each strip together and roll into a 12-inch rope with your hands. Transfer the rope to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Grab the ends and bring them toward each other, forming a U shape, then cross the left end over the right end to make a pretzel shape. Cross the left end over the right again to make a twist in the middle. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough and the remaining cheese, spacing the pretzels 3 inches apart. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes; preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl. Brush the pretzels with the egg; sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes and coarse salt. Bake until browned, 16 to 18 minutes, checking on the pretzels every 5 minutes to avoid overbaking.Photograph by Victor Schrager'

S'For the salsa verde: Heat a griddle, grill, or skillet over high heat and add the tomatillos, garlic, and jalapenos all at once. Eyeball them, but do about a minute or two on each side, turning with tongs, until everything is close to getting black but not black.Put the charred vegetables in the blender with the avocado, water, and salt and blend until smooth. Add the cilantro and blend again.For the steak: Combine the seasonings in a small bowl. Squeeze the limes over the meat evenly, using all their juices. Then rub the lime halves over the meat to get the pulp over it. Sprinkle the seasoning mix over both sides.Heat a grill to medium-high. Grill the steak to your liking; we like it medium-well. Remove, let rest 5 minutes, and then slice it across the grain in angled strips. Using 2 tortillas per taco, pile in some meat, onion, and cilantro and top with salsa verde.'

S"*Cook\\'s Note: Seeds-in for hot, seeds-out for medium-hot. If you cannot find a red chile, substitute 2 jalapenos. A red chile is a ripened jalapeno.In a small saucepan, over high heat, bring the water to a boil, then turn off the heat and add 1 teaspoon salt and the agave, stirring until dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool.In a glass bowl, add the vinegar, lime juice, lime slices, peppercorns, chile peppers, and whole and minced garlic. Stir in the cooled salt-agave water mixture.Wash and trim the green beans. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium heat. Stir in the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, then add the beans. Cook until the beans begin to turn bright green and are just tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and drain. Rinse immediately with cold water and put them in an ice bath for 10 minutes. Drain well.If you are canning, prepare the jar(s) according to processing directions, add the beans and then cover with the vinegar chile pepper mixture. Process in a canning pot for 3 minutes, remove and cool.You can also put them in sterilized jars and refrigerate instead of doing the canning process. Just keep under refrigeration and eat within 1 month. Whichever method suits you best, allow these to marinate for 48 hours before eating."

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Season the trotters with salt and pepper, place in a roasting pan and roast until the edges are slightly crispy, about 1 hour.Add the roasted trotters, wine, mushrooms, onion, turnip, garlic, lemongrass, kaffir leaves, ginger, star anise and 2 gallons of cold water to a stock pot. Bring to a decent simmer and cook on medium-low heat, skimming occasionally, until reduced by a third, about 2 hours. Strain the stock through a fine mesh strainer, discard the solids and stir in the sweet soy. You will want to drink this straight. Do not do this. Fight the urge. You just made pretty awesome pork stock.Preheat the oven again to 350 degrees F. Heat a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat.Season the pork cheeks with salt and pepper and sear until they begin to get color and crust, about 4 minutes per side.Place the cheeks in a single layer in a large oven-safe pan or a casserole dish. Cover the cheeks about 3/4 of the way with the pork stock and cover with foil. Cook in the oven until the meat just pulls apart with a fork, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Cooking time will differ depending on the size of the cheeks, so check them at the 1 1/2-hour mark. Reserve about a cup of the braising liquid. You just braised pork cheeks! Excellent work. We are close to the eating part.Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add a splash of canola oil and the carrots and saute until they begin to crisp on the outside, about 5 minutes. Add the bok choy and cook just until it wilts, about 4 minutes. Add the cheeks and a splash of the braising liquid, then gently heat through until the cheeks are hot to the touch. Add the cabbage.Serve the pork cheeks and vegetables over jasmine rice and garnish with cilantro and scallions. Eat the great food you just made. Share it with a friend, or don\\'t. Well done.This recipe was provided by a chef, restaurant or culinary professional and may have been scaled down from a bulk recipe.

S'To make the brine: In a large stockpot, over medium-high heat, heat oil and sweat the onions, peppers and garlic until just softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add water, sugar, salt, wine, honey and peppercorns and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, let cool 15 minutes then add ice to cool completely. Submerge chicken pieces into brine and refrigerate for 4 to 12 hours.Remove chicken from brine, rinse and pat dry. In a small bowl, combine the flour and spices. Divide mixture between 2 shallow bowls. Pour buttermilk in a separate bowl. Dredge chicken pieces in flour, then buttermilk, then dredge in second bowl of flour. Set pieces on a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack and let chicken rest 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet to 350 degrees F. Add the chicken carefully, cooking in batches, if necessary. Do not overcrowd pan. Cook chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes, turning pieces as they brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season with salt and serve.'

Place the pork butt in the baking dish and cover it with the liquid smoke.3. Rub the salt onto one side of the meat. Flip the meat over so the salted side is on the bottom(if the salt comes in contact with the foil while roasting, it will eat it through).4. Top the pork butt with the remaining banana leaf half. Add 1 cup water to the baking dishand cover it tightly with foil.5. Roast until the meat is easily shredded with your fingers or a fork, 8 to 12 hours, about 1 hourper pound.6. Remove the pork from the baking dish, reserving 1 cup of the roasting liquid. Discard thebanana leaf, foil, and remaining roasting liquid.7. Cool the pork slightly, then shred it with your fingers and a fork, removing any large fat deposits and sinewy meat. Toss with a small amount of the reserved baking liquid (it will be salty,so proceed with caution). When the pork is seasoned as you like it, set it aside to cool thoroughly.Makes 8 cups shredded pork.'

Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.Add the olive oil and fine salt to the yeast mixture. Then use the dough hook to mix in the flour. Mix until the dough comes together. Add more flour as needed and allow the machine to knead the dough until smooth, about 10 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat the surface. Cover the bowl with a towel and let stand in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.Turn out the dough onto a floured surface. Divide in 4 pieces. Form into 4 smooth, tight balls. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise again for 30 minutes or in the refrigerator overnight.Once risen, use immediately or wrap and freeze until ready for use, for up to 2 weeks.'

S'For the fruit relish: Preheat an oiled grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the pineapple and mango slices until grill-marked, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Set aside to cool, then slice into 1/4-inch cubes. In a large bowl, combine the fruit with the jalapeno, red chile, onion, olive oil, lemon juice and pickle relish. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Set aside in the fridge.For the hot dogs: Set a grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook the bacon for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, just to render some fat, not to cook through. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.With a sharp knife, make a small lengthwise slit down the center of each hot dog (do not cut all the way through). Cut the jalapeno slices so you can unroll them into long strips. Place 2 or 3 jalapeno strips into the slit of each hot dog. Wrap each dog with a strip of bacon and secure it in place with toothpicks. In the same grill pan used for the bacon, cook the hot dogs until the bacon is cooked through and crisp, rotating frequently, 5 to 6 minutes total.To serve, toast the buns for 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the toothpicks from the hot dogs and nestle the dogs in the buns. Top with fruit relish and serve with ketchup and mustard.'

Once combined, slowly add the water, a little at a time, and mix with your hands until a soft dough forms, (you may not need all of the water). Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until the dough is smooth and bounces back when poked with a finger, about 5 minutes.Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll out into 1/4-inch thick disks. Let rest while you make the orange honey syrup.Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oranges with the syrup and toss to coat with the butter. When the butter starts to brown just a bit, remove the pan from the heat and add the orange liqueur and the remaining cinnamon. Pour the honey over the oranges and heat just until the honey starts to foam, about 3 minutes.Heat 2 inches of oil in a large cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F. Add the dough disks to the hot oil, in batches, until they are golden and have puffed up, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel to drain.Cut the fry bread in quarters and arrange on a platter. Pour the orange mixture over the top and garnish with a generous amount of powdered sugar.'

S"Preheat oven to 300 degrees F or preheat a grill over high heat.   Rub the peppers with canola oil, put them on a baking sheet and roast them in the oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. They can also be grilled until blackened all over.  Remove the peppers to a bowl and cover the bowl. Let rest until cool enough to handle, then remove the skin and seeds and dice.  Do not rinse.Put a Dutch oven on the stove top over high heat, coat with some canola oil and add the capicola. Saute for 3 to 5 minutes. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and add them to the pot with 3 tablespoons of oil. Brown well on all sides, then remove them to a plate.  Add the onions and saute until they are starting to caramelize, then add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.  Stir in the capers and caper juice. Mix to combine and allow the mixture to caramelize a bit more. Deglaze with the white wine.  Stir in the agave, chicken stock and red wine vinegar.  Bring to a boil, then add the seared ribs along with the diced peppers.Cover and bake for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove the pork from the oven to a serving platter and serve with the sauce.Guy\\'s tip: you can uncover 3/4 of the way through to allow the sauce to reduce for serving.  Another alternative is to remove the Dutch oven from the oven, put the pork onto a serving platter and simmer the sauce over high heat to reduce for about 5 to 10 minutes before serving."

Add the marmalade, mustard, black pepper and chili powder and cook about 2 minutes, until fully combined. Reserve until ready to use.Preheat a grill to high. Grill the patties until nice markings are shown, about 5 minutes per side, then reduce the flame to medium and cook until well done, 12 more minutes, flipping after 5 minutes. At the same time, toast the buns on the grill.Serve the burgers on the buns; top with the glaze, lettuce, tomato and red onion. Serve with pickles.Photograph by Jennifer Causey'

S'Preheat the oil in a deep fryer (or a large, heavy-based pot) to 350 degrees F.Wipe the tops of the mushrooms with a damp cloth to clean, and then scrape the gills off from the underside with the back of a spoon. Trim the stem and slice into 1/4-inch strips.Place the flour into a rimmed dish, the beaten eggs in a second rimmed dish and sprinkle both with some salt and pepper. In a third dish add the panko, some Italian seasoning, the paprika, garlic powder, and some more salt and pepper. Mix well. Dredge the mushroom "fries" in the flour, followed by the egg mixture and finally in the seasoned panko.Working in batches of 5 to 6, fry the mushrooms in the hot oil until golden brown and crunchy, about 4 minutes. Drain on a wire rack over some paper towels and season once more with salt.'

S'For the spicy tartar: Combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, pickles, red pepper, onion, capers, lemon juice, tarragon, chives, hot sauce and cayenne in a mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Stir well, then cover and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes to allow flavors to come together.For the sardines: Preheat a grill to high.  Rinse the sardines in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Season the cavity of each sardine with salt and pepper, then place a sprig of thyme and oregano inside each along with a few slices of lemon and garlic.  Season outside with salt and pepper.  Carefully tie the sardines with butchers twine to help keep them closed during grilling. Wipe down the grill grates with a towel dipped in oil to clean and create a non-stick surface.  Carefully place sardines across grates and grill for 3 to 4 minutes, until skin blisters and chars around the edges.  Using a spatula, carefully turn the sardines and grill for a further 2 to 3 minutes to cook through.  When done, remove to a platter and keep warm until ready to serve.  Serve the sardines slathered with the Spicy Tartar.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.For the garlic butter: Place the garlic in a small saute pan and set over medium heat. Add the butter and warm through. Cook the garlic until fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Then place the garlic butter in the fridge to firm up again.For the blistered chile: Toss the poblano with olive oil to coat. Place the pepper under the broiler or char on the grill over a direct flame until the skin blisters. When done, remove the seeds, stem and roughly chop. Reserve.For the onions and peppers: Set a large saute pan over high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and saute the onions and bell peppers until wilted, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with the paprika and some salt and pepper.For the turkey burgers: In a large mixing bowl, combine the turkey, mustard, Worcestershire, cumin, white pepper and the reserved blistered chile. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Mix gently until well combined. Form into four 4-ounce burger patties. Wipe the grill down with oil-blotted towels, and then place the burgers on the hot grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the burgers, top with a slice of cheese and cook until cooked through and cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside and allow to rest.Smear the buns with the garlic butter. Grill the buns until golden and crispy, 20 to 30 seconds on each side.To build the burgers, place 1 grilled turkey burger on the bottom half of the bun. Then top with a good heaping of sauteed onions and peppers. Finish with the top half of the bun and skewer to hold all of it together. Serve with extra mustard on the side.'

S'For the salad: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Using a sharp knife, cut the squash halves into 1-inch cubes, leaving the skin intact. Add to a bowl and toss with 3 generous tablespoons of the olive oil, the thyme and season with salt and black pepper. Transfer to a large baking sheet. Roast the squash until fork tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool slightly.Add 3 cups water, the lentils, onions, garlic, lemon slices, bay leaf, red pepper flakes and some black pepper to a medium saucepot. Set over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with salt. Remove from the heat and drain. Discard the onions, lemons and bay leaf. Put the lentils in a large glass mixing bowl, toss with a scant tablespoon olive oil and set aside.For the caramelized onions: Meanwhile, place a large saute pan over high heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Once hot, add the sliced onions. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until starting to color, about 30 seconds. Reduce the heat to low. Caramelize, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes; the onions should be tacky and deep golden brown. Remove from the heat and keep warm.For the yogurt vinaigrette: In a large glass mixing bowl, whisk the white wine vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, mint, cilantro and scallions together until incorporated. Drizzle in the olive oil and whisk until smooth, about a minute. Add the yogurt and continue whisking until creamy, an additional minute. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate in an airtight container until ready for use, or up to 3 days.To serve: When the squash is cool enough to handle, transfer to bowl with the lentils. Drizzle in the yogurt vinaigrette and toss to coat completely. Spoon into a large serving dish and garnish with the caramelized onions.'

S'For the cake: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the 2 teaspoons flour and 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Brush an 8-inch round cake pan with olive oil and then dust with the flour-sugar mix.With a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs on high speed with the 1 1/3 cup sugar until they turn opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Switch to the paddle attachment and add the milk, the 1/2 cup olive oil, the cream and orange zest. Mix the 1 1/3 cup flour, the yeast and salt together and incorporate into the batter, scraping down the sides as needed. Combine well, 2 to 3 minutes. Allow the batter to rest in a warm place 10 to 15 minutes.Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake until toothpick inserted comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven allow to cool in the pan 10 minutes. Run a small knife around the edge of the pan, turn the pan over, tapping if necessary to release the cake, and place on a rack and allow to cool completely. Once cool, invert and place on a rimmed cake plate.For the syrup: Remove the zest from the orange using a peeler, avoiding the pith, and place in a medium saucepan with the orange juice and sugar. Cook over medium heat until a thick syrup forms, 45 minutes to 1 hour.Strain and discard the zest strips. Pour 1/2 the syrup over the cooled cake, and then pierce the surface with a fork to allow the syrup to soak into the cake. Return the remaining syrup to the stove and continue to reduce until very thick and syrupy, an additional 15 to 20 minutes.For the toppings: In a small skillet, lightly toast the pine nuts over medium heat until just starting to color, 3 to 4 minutes. Roughly chop the pine nuts.Arrange the segmented oranges around the outside edge of the cake and place a small fan of them in the center. Garnish with the pine nuts and drizzle with the reduced syrup. Cut into slices and serve with creme fraiche.'

S'In a medium saucepan, heat the oil to 325 degrees F. Line a plate with paper towels.In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs and milk thoroughly. In another shallow bowl, combine the panko and Italian breadcrumbs.Dredge 1 side of an egg roll wrapper in the egg wash. Place the wrapper egg wash-side up on a work surface and put 2 salami slices in the center of the wrapper, toward the edge closest to you. Place 1 cheese stick on top of the salami. Roll the wrapper edge closest to you over the filling. Tuck in the ends and continue to roll until you have an egg roll shape.Dredge the rolled wrapper in the egg wash again and thoroughly coat in the breadcrumb mixture. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. (The rolls can be frozen for future use at this point.)Add 1 or 2 rolls to the oil at a time and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown. Be careful not to overcook them or cook them on too high a temperature, as the wraps may explode. Transfer the fried cheese rolls to the paper towel-lined plate and serve immediately with marinara sauce. Garnish with parmesan and parsley, if desired.Photograph by Yunhee Kim'

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Rinse the chicken under cold water and pat dry. Slip your fingers under the breast skin and gently create a pocket the length of both breasts.  Season the inside of the cavity with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Set aside.Add the arugula and 5 cloves of the garlic to a food processor fitted a blade.  Pulse 3 to 4 times, then add 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper, squeeze in the juice of 1/2 lemon and pulse 3 to 4 more times. Add the cheese and pistachios, and with the processor running, drizzle in the olive oil. Scrape down sides and pulse a few more times. Adjust seasoning, if necessary.Gently work half of the pesto under the breast skin. Reserve the other half of the pesto. Put the other lemon half into the cavity along with the remaining 2 peeled garlic cloves. Rub the chicken all over with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Season the outside of the chicken with the remaining salt and pepper. Tuck the wing tips under the bird, and truss the chicken. Put the chicken, on its side, into a roasting pan and put in hot oven. Roast at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes, rotate chicken onto other side, and roast for 15 minutes more. Carefully turn chicken onto its back (breast side up), reduce heat to 350 degrees F and roast for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, begin basting it with the pan juices. Repeat until chicken is done and an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F.Remove the roasting pan from the oven, put the chicken on a carving board and tent it with foil. Remove the fat on the top of the pan juices. Put the roasting pan over a burner on medium heat and add 1/3 cup of the reserved pesto. Stir and incorporate it into the pan juices along with any bits that might be on the bottom of the pan.  Whisk the cornstarch and the half-and-half in a small bowl and slowly add it to the pan. Stir continually until the mixture starts to thicken. Adjust seasonings, if necessary, and pour it into a serving bowl.Carve the chicken, arrange it on a serving platter and serve with the sauce.'

Cover with a damp towel until ready to use.Once chicken is cool enough to handle, make a small slit in the leg and add about 1 to 2 teaspoons of the mustard. Working with 1 sheet of filo at a time, lightly brush with butter, top with another sheet, and lightly brush with butter again. Repeat so there are 3 to 4 layers of filo evenly stacked on top of one another. Roll 1 leg inside the stacked and brushed filo, leaving the bone end of the drumstick exposed.

S'For the filling: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.In a bowl, toss the poblano peppers with the canola oil. Place on the grill along with the scallions and corn and cook, turning occasionally, until the vegetables are nicely charred.Immediately place the peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 10 minutes to sweat and soften. Chop the charred scallions and put them into a large bowl. Cut the corn kernels off the ear and add to the bowl. Peel the skins off the peppers, finely chop and then add them to the corn and scallions. Stir in the goat cheese and Parmesan.Heat a large saute pan on the grill, add the chorizo and cook until the oils are released and the chorizo is slightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chorizo to the poblano-cheese mixture and gently fold together. Set aside until ready to use.For the arepas: Combine the masa flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in 2 1/2 cups hot water and, using a wooden spoon, stir to combine. Add in the melted butter, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.Divide the dough into 12 small balls. Place each ball in between two pieces of plastic wrap and flatten using a heavy-bottomed skillet or tortilla press to about 3 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick.Heat the canola oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Fry the arepas until lightly browned--they should have a nice crust on the outside but still be soft inside--about 5 minutes per side.Using a sharp knife, slice the arepas in half, similar to an English muffin. Stuff 1 to 2 teaspoons of the filling inside each. Garnish with some chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice.'

Add half the onion, the carrot and celery and cook, stirring, until softened. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring, about 2 minutes. Add the water, bay leaf, and peppercorns, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, about 30 minutes. Strain; you should have about 2 cups stock; if more, return stock to clean saucepan and reduce over medium heat. In a skillet, melt on medium heat the 4 tablespoons of butter, add the remaining onion, and cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, thyme, basil, red pepper, and paprika and cook another 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice. Carefully arrange shrimp in a pan large enough to hold them without overlapping. Pour seasoned butter over shrimp and mix well with shrimp. Bake until just cooked through, about 10 minutes. (Do not overcook or you will have rubbery shrimp.)Remove shrimp from pan and place pan back on stovetop over medium-high heat to make the sauce. Add beer and 1 cup shrimp stock to the seasoned butter, cook until reduced to 1/3 volume.Whisk in cold stick butter, 2-3 pats at a time, until sauce holds together. Remove from heat and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and hot sauce. Arrange shrimp on a platter and drizzle with sauce. Garnish with sliced green onion.'

S'1. In a large glass bowl, combine the water, yeast, agave nectar, and cornmeal. Let sit in a warm place for 10 to 15 minutes, until foamy. Stir in 4 cups of the flour, the sea salt, and the oil. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead just until all ingredients are well incorporated and dough is smooth. (Add more flour as needed if sticky). Lightly oil a large glass bowl and place the dough ball into it. Cover the bowl and set aside in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.2. In a medium skillet over medium- high heat, cook the bacon until just crisp. With a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a paper-towel- lined plate. Add the onion to the rendered fat and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until soft and deep brown.3. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, chili sauce, chipotle, and 1/4 cup cilantro and blend well. Refrigerate until needed.4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease and flour a 9-by-5- inch loaf pan.5. Turn the dough onto a floured surface, sprinkle it with flour, and knead gently until smooth, folding over several times. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a rectangle about 12 by 9 inches.6. Spread the dough generously with the chipotle mayonnaise. Cover with the brisket, then the onion, roasted pepper, and bacon. Sprinkle evenly with the Havarti, the remaining cilantro, and cracked pepper.7. From the short side, gently roll up the dough "jelly roll" style, tucking in the ends as you go. Place the dough roll in the prepared loaf pan, brush with the melted butter, and sprinkle the top with the dry Jack. Bake for 1 hour 25 minutes, until dark golden brown. You should hear a slightly hollow sound when you tap the bread.8. Cool for a full 30 minutes in the pan on a wire rack. Then remove from the loaf pan and slice into 1- inch thick slices. Enjoy immediately.'

If the dough seems crumbly, and not binding, drizzle in a few drops of the water, a little at a time, until it binds.Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead a few times.  Divide in half, cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Put a silicone baking mat on your work surface and roll the dough into a rectangle, about 6 by 9 inches and 1/4-inch thick.  Evenly trim the edges, adding back any trimmings to the second portion of dough.  Cut 2-inch strips with a knife, but leaving the dough in place.  Then cut diagonals to form triangular pieces, 2 inches on their long side.  Repeat, gently transferring them to a baking sheet fitted with a silicone baking mat, spacing them 1-inch apart.  Repeat with second half of dough.Bake for 9 to 12 minutes, checking carefully after 9 minutes.  Crackers will start to turn golden.Remove from oven and let cool.

S'To make the marinade for the pork: In a food processor, blend garlic and ginger by pulsing 3 times. Add in jalapeno and red bell pepper, pulse 3 times. Add in remaining ingredients except pork, pulse 3 to 5 times to blend well, but not liquefy. Season, to taste. Remove 1 1/2 cups of marinade and set aside. Place pork in a resealable plastic bag and pour marinade over. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 4 hours.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove pork from refrigerator while oven is preheating, drain off excess marinade and discard. Place pork in a roasting pan fitted with a rack and cook until the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F, on an instant-read thermometer, approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.Meanwhile, to make the greens: In a medium, non reactive bowl, whisk together reserved marinade, vinegar, lime juice, cilantro, red pepper flakes and slowly whisk in oil. Add half of the vinaigrette to a large bowl with the bok choy, cabbage and green onions and toss to combine. Cover and set aside. Reserve the other half of the vinaigrette.Cook pasta al dente according to directions, add in olive oil and soy, toss to combine.Remove pork from oven and let rest covered loosely for 10 minutes. Slice thin.For final assembly: Arrange pasta on a large platter and top with sliced pork and prepared vegetables. Drizzle entire dish with about 1/3 cup of the reserved vinaigrette.

S"Cook\\'s Note: Yucca is a potato-like starchy root vegetable native to South America. It can be found in the produce aisle of your local supermarket or online. Shishito peppers are a small, sweet Japanese pepper from the bell pepper family. They are available at Japanese specialty markets or online.Peel the yucca and cut into 1-inch cubes. Place in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Simmer and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool.Set a large skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil and fry the yucca until crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and season with salt. Add the peppers, garlic and onions to the pan and saute until well caramelized, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Fold the corn, peas and crispy fried yucca back into the pan and heat through. Season with salt, pepper and paprika. Toss to combine everything and serve hot."

S"Cook\\'s Note: Goat\\'s milk can be found at your local health food store or online.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease four 6-ounce ramekins with nonstick cooking spray.Set a small saucepan over high heat and add the granulated sugar to make caramel. Without stirring, let the sugar melt. As it melts, gently swirl the pan around to melt all the sugar evenly. When it turns dark amber, carefully divide evenly among the ramekins (take care as the caramel is extremely hot).Combine the milk and superfine sugar in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the egg yolks, whole eggs and vanilla to a large mixing bowl. Whisk together until foamy, then add a little of the hot milk to temper the eggs. Stir to combine, then gradually add the rest of the milk (adding it all at once, or too much, will cook and scramble the eggs). Once completely incorporated, stir well and then divide evenly among the four ramekins. Line a turkey roaster with a kitchen towel and carefully place the ramekins on top. Place the roasting dish in the oven, then fill with hot water so it comes 3/4 of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the custards are set, 35 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the oven and allow to cool. Chill in the fridge before inverting onto a plate to serve."

Set aside.Using a sharp knife, cut the tubular top portion away from the globe-shaped bottoms of both squash. Using the knife or a mandoline, shave the tops into chips. Submerge the chips in a deep container with ice water for 10 minutes (this removes any extra starch and makes the chips crispy). Strain the chips and pat dry.Meanwhile, using an instant-read thermometer, bring 3 inches of duck fat to 325 degrees F in a heavy gauge Dutch oven over medium heat. Working in batches, fry the chips until they are golden and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer with a fine mesh strainer to a paper-towel-lined dish. Season immediately with a sprinkle of spice mix. Repeat until all chips are fried. Transfer to a large bowl and serve.'

Cook until golden brown and crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. To the same saute pan, add the cream, butter and 1 tablespoon of the black pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by a third, about 5 minutes. Stir in the Parmigiano and the Pecorino until smooth; the sauce will be a little thick. Keep warm over low heat.With tongs, remove the linguine from the pot and add it directly to the sauce; toss along with 1 cup of the pasta cooking water to thin the sauce out. Transfer to a large serving platter and garnish with more Parmigiano and Pecorino, the remaining 1 tablespoon pepper, and the parsley. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Serve immediately.'

Place the prepared root vegetables in a large mixing bowl, and add olive oil, thyme, garlic, salt and pepper. Toss to mix everything together and coat the vegetables evenly. Remove the hot tray from the oven (this will ensure the vegetables don\\'t stick to the pan and get a nice initial sear on the bottoms) and pour the vegetables onto the tray. Spread the vegetables out evenly and roast until the vegetables are tender and nicely caramelized on the outside, 35 to 45 minutes. Allow the vegetables to cool slightly before mixing with the pasta.For the vinaigrette: Combine the vinegar, honey, mustard and garlic together in a small bowl. While whisking slowly, add the olive oil so it emulsifies. Fold in the parsley, scallions and thyme and season with salt and pepper.For assembly: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and toss together with the warm roasted root vegetables. Add the vinaigrette and mix together well.

Place the oranges in a bowl and add the turbinado sugar and orange liqueur; toss to coat. Arrange the oranges on the wire rack and transfer to the oven. Cook until the sugar has caramelized, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool, then sprinkle the oranges with the salt and pepper. Reserve to the side.Combine the heavy whipping cream and vanilla seeds in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk until soft peaks form. Fold in the mascarpone and set aside.To assemble: Spoon a dollop of mascarpone whipped cream into 4 to 6 footed parfait glasses. Top with a layer of caramelized oranges. Repeat four more times, so there are five layers of whipped cream and oranges in each glass. Refrigerate the parfaits for 20 minutes to set up.Garnish each parfait with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of cinnamon, if using. Serve immediately.'

S'Place the duck breasts skin-side down on a cutting board and trim any excess skin that hangs over the sides of the breasts. Flip the breasts over and score the skin with four parallel, diagonal cuts. Dust the breasts on both sides with the five-spice powder.Heat a cast-iron pan over medium-low heat. Place duck breasts in the pan, skin-side down, and cook until the fat has melted and the skin is golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Flip the breasts over and continue to cook for about 10 minutes for medium doneness.  Remove the duck to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes (this ensures the duck will be plump and juicy). To serve, cut the breasts into 1/4-inch-thick slices and spread out in a shingle pattern on a large platter.'

S'Mix 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F), the yeast and agave in a bowl. Set aside 5 minutes.In a food processor fitted with the dough blade, pulse the whole-wheat flour, 2 cups all-purpose flour and the sea salt. Add 1 egg and the yeast mixture and pulse in 10-second intervals until the dough comes together, about 3 pulses. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead 10 to 12 times, adding up to 3/4 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cut the dough into 4 equal portions; cover with a clean towel. On a floured board, roll out one piece of dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, with a shorter side facing you.  Spread  1/4 cup Nutella across the middle of the dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough over the Nutella, then sprinkle 1/2 cup coconut over the folded part. Fold the top third of the dough over the coconut. Reroll the dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle. Cut into seven 11-by-2-inch strips.One at a time, pinch the cut long edges of each strip together and roll into a 12-inch rope with your hands. Transfer the rope to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Grab the ends and bring them toward each other, forming a U shape, then cross the left end over the right end to make a pretzel shape. Cross the left end over the right again to make a twist in the middle. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough dough and the remaining Nutella and coconut, spacing the pretzels 3 inches apart. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes; preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl. Mix the sugar, chile powder, cinnamon, cloves and cayenne in another bowl. Brush the pretzels with the egg; sprinkle with the spice mixture. Bake until browned, 16 to 18 minutes, checking on the pretzels every 5 minutes to avoid overbaking.Photograph by Victor Schrager'

S'Make the soup: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut the tops off the garlic heads to expose the cloves and remove any excess papery skins. Place on a large sheet of foil; drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Close the foil around the garlic, leaving a space between the tops and the foil, and place on a baking sheet. Roast until soft and fragrant, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove from the foil, let cool and squeeze out the garlic into a bowl.In a large heavy soup pot (preferably enameled cast iron) over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the roasted garlic and cook, stirring, until slightly thick, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and cook until a dark golden roux forms, stirring frequently, 5 to 6 more minutes. Add 1 cup chicken stock and stir to incorporate, then repeat until all of the stock has been added. Add 2 cups water in 1-cup increments, stirring after each. Add the Italian seasoning, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, and stir to combine well. Bring to a simmer and cook 15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the crostini: Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the paprika and oregano and mix well. Place the bread on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush with the oil-spice mixture. Top each slice with about 1 teaspoon cheese and bake until the cheese is melted and the bread is starting to crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.Add the cream to the soup and cook at a very low simmer, stirring occasionally, 10 more minutes. Adjust the seasoning if needed. Ladle into small mugs or bowls; top with parsley and drizzle with olive oil. Serve with the crostini.Photograph by Con Poulos'

In a medium bowl, combine the walnuts, pecans, brown sugar and cloves. Gently fold in the egg whites and 3/4 cup of the syrup, until combined.To assemble: Remove the phyllo from the package, being careful to keep it covered and cool. Take out 1 sheet and put it on a work surface. Gently brush with butter and fold in half. Add approximately 1/4 cup filling, toward the bottom half of the pastry and fold over the long end. Roll up, tucking in the ends as you roll. Set on a parchment lined baking sheet and brush with butter. Repeat until all cigars are assembled. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes, keeping an eye on them so they don\\'t brown too quickly.Remove from oven, let cool for 2 minutes. On a clean work surface, cut the baklava in half on the diagonal and transfer to a serving tray or platter. Drizzle with remaining syrup, sprinkle with slivered almonds and dust with powdered sugar. Can be served warm or at room temperature."

S'For the bread pudding: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. and place a rack in the center of the oven. Lightly grease four 6-ounce heatproof ramekins with butter. Place the ramekins into a baking dish that is large enough to hold them without touching. Place the bread cubes, apples and raisins in the ramekins, dividing the ingredients evenly.Using a whisk, beat the eggs, half-and-half, brown sugar, butter, Calvados, vanilla, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of kosher salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Carefully pour the custard over the bread cubes, pressing the bread cubes down so they are covered with the custard. Set aside to allow the bread to absorb the custard, about 15 minutes.Prepare a water bath: Carefully pour enough hot water into the baking dish so that the water is halfway up the sides of the ramekins. (A water bath is used to provide temperature protection for the egg custard.)Bake until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Another way to judge whether the puddings are fully baked is to gently press down on the center of each. If any uncooked custard comes up to the top, the pudding needs to be baked a little longer. Remove the bread puddings from the water bath and cool slightly. The puddings can be served warm or slightly chilled.Meanwhile, make the vanilla bean whipped cream: Put the heavy cream and vanilla bean seeds in a large bowl. Whisk until soft peaks form. Serve immediately with the puddings or refrigerate until ready to use.'

S"Prepare the chicken: Put the mangoes, cilantro, chipotles, adobo sauce, vinegar, garlic, lemon juice, canola oil, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a food processor and puree until smooth. Adjust the seasoning to taste.Toss the chicken with half of the mango mixture in a resealable plastic bag and massage to coat the chicken with the sauce. Refrigerate at least 6 hours to marinate.Put the other half of the mango mixture in a small saucepan and simmer over low heat until thick, stirring often, about 15 minutes. Season with salt. Set some of the simmered mango sauce aside for serving and use the rest for basting.Preheat a grill to medium and brush with canola oil. Remove the chicken from the marinade, brushing off the excess marinade so it doesn\\'t burn, and put on the grill. Grill the chicken, turning, until cooked through, about 30 minutes, basting with the simmered mango sauce during the last 5 minutes.Meanwhile, make the chimichurri: Combine the cilantro, parsley, scallions, garlic, grapeseed oil, agave, lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste in a food processor and pulse to roughly chop. Continue processing until the sauce is finely chopped but not smooth (it shouldn\\'t be a puree). Set aside at least 15 minutes before serving.Transfer the chicken to a platter and serve with the chimichurri and the reserved mango sauce.Photograph by Kat Teutsch"

Segment, add the orange flesh to the pot, and squeeze in any remaining juices from the blood orange membrane.Cook\\'s Note: To segment an orange, remove the top and bottom from the orange over a small bowl (to catch the juices). Peel the orange with a small sharp knife, carefully removing all of the pith. Carefully slice between the segments, down each side, and allow to fall into the bowl as you proceed."

Cut the Brussels sprouts in half lengthwise, through the stem. Using a sharp knife or mandoline, finely slice the Brussels sprouts crosswise to give you fine ribbons. Remove the tough stems from the kale leaves and discard. Stack the leaves up on top of one another and cut across the stem so it yields a similar shape to the shaved Brussels sprouts. Cut the sides of the apple off and cut into thin slices.To make the vinaigrette, combine the olive oil, champagne vinegar, Dijon mustard and some salt and pepper in a bowl, whisking together until lightly emulsified. To serve, mix the Brussels sprouts, kale and apple together well in a large salad bowl. Lightly dress with the champagne vinaigrette, and then top with shaved Pecorino and chopped toasted hazelnuts.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the dry rub: Mix together the garlic, paprika, salt, pepper and cayenne in a small bowl.For the scallops: Trim the side muscle from the scallops, if not done already. Pat the scallops dry and sprinkle them on both sides with the dry rub. Wrap the scallops with the prosciutto so that only the top is showing. To do this, spread out a slice of prosciutto; set a scallop on its edge and roll it up in the prosciutto, tucking prosciutto under one side as you go and leaving the other side exposed.Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter and sear the scallops on the prosciutto side for 1 to 2 minutes without disturbing, to ensure a good crust. Flip the scallops and cook on the scallop side for 3 to 4 minutes, or until opaque. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter to the pan and baste the scallops with the melted butter. Transfer the cooked scallops to a platter. Deglaze the pan with the white wine, whisking vigorously to emulsify; stir in the chives and parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon some of the pan sauce over the scallops; serve any extra sauce on the side. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and serve.'

S'Submerge pork chops the saucepan with the brine for 20 minutes. Remove and pat dry with paper towels.Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.Season the chops on both sides with kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper. Arrange the chops on a baking sheet and put in the oven. Roast the chops until an instant-read thermometer registers 90 degrees F, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, while the chops are in the oven, in a medium-size saucepan, add the canned cherries, 3/4 of a cup of Madeira, the orange zest, ginger, agave and a pinch of salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to a strong simmer and reduce the sauce by half.Once the chops have reached 90 degrees F, remove them from the oven.Heat a large skillet over high heat, add the grapeseed oil and heat until shimmering. Add the chops, being careful not to crowd them, and cook for 4 minutes per side. They will be golden and have a hard crust. Transfer them to a serving platter and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. In the same skillet that the chops were cooked in, add the remaining 1/4 cup of Madeira and deglaze the pan over medium-high heat. Stir in the balsamic and cherry sauce and reduce by half. Turn off the heat, add the butter and stir to combine. Pour the cherry sauce over the chops and serve.'

S"For the veggie slaw: In a small bowl, combine the lemon zest and juice, olive oil, Aleppo pepper and salt. Whisk well, and set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, add the romaine, cherry tomatoes, parsley, mint, cucumber, red onion and red pepper. Mix together until well combined. Pour the lemon dressing over the slaw and toss to thoroughly coat, being careful not to bruise the lettuce.For the za\\'atar flatbread: Place a wok, dome-side up, over a burner and preheat over medium heat.Divide the pizza dough in half and roll into balls. Oil the dough and set aside at room temperature until it can be easily rolled out, about 30 minutes. Flatten the dough balls and, with a floured rolling pin, roll each into a 12- to 14-inch circle.In a small mixing bowl combine the za\\'atar and 4 tablespoons of the olive oil; reserve to the side. Season the pre-heated wok with 1 tablespoon of the remaining olive oil. Set the first flatbread over the domed wok surface; it will start to cook immediately. Brush with half of the olive oil-za\\'atar mixture, spreading it evenly to 1/4-inch from the edges. Cook the flatbread until just lightly brown on the bottom. Remove to a flat surface, and repeat for other flatbread.To serve, add some veggie slaw to each flatbread, garnish with the goat cheese and roll up like a burrito. Cut in half and serve.

S'Rinse the chicken and pat dry.  Season with 1 tablespoon salt and pepper.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil to a large stockpot over high heat.  Add the chicken pieces and lightly brown evenly, removing and adding as necessary.  Once all of the chicken is browned, add ingredients through smashed garlic. Brown the vegetables over high heat for 5 to 6 minutes, then add in the water, peppercorns, savory and bay leaf and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a strong simmer and after 20 minutes, check the chicken pieces, removing as they finish cooking.   Remove the chicken, to a cutting board and cool until you are able to handle, then the strip meat and put bones back into pot.Simmer the stock and bone mixture, uncovered, for 45 minutes.  Strain and adjust seasoning with additional salt, if needed.  Chop the meat, discarding any skin, ligament or fat as you go and set aside.In a separate saute pan over medium heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and diced vegetables.  Saute until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes, then add the garlic and red chili flakes and saute for 1 minute more.  Add the vegetables to the strained chicken stock, then in the same saute pan, add the butter. When melted, add the flour and stir constantly for 2 minutes.  Slowly ladle in some of the hot stock, whisking as you add, until approximately 2 cups of stock have been added.  Add the roux mixture back into the stock pot and combine well.  Add the cream and the chicken back into the stock pot and keep at a low simmer while you prepare the dumplins.Dumplins:In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients.  In a separate medium, nonreactive bowl, combine the wet ingredients, adding the melted butter last.Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and with a rubber spatula, very gently, fold together until just combined.Using 2 dinner spoons, shape the dough into golf ball-size, quenelle shaped biscuits and drop them into the hot soup.  Cover with a tight fitting lid and allow the dumplins to cook for 15 to 20 minutes over low heat.Ladle into soup bowls and serve hot.'

Set aside.Using a sharp knife, cut the tubular top portion away from the globe-shaped bottoms of both squash. Using the knife or a mandoline, shave the tops into chips. Submerge the chips in a deep container with ice water for 10 minutes (this removes any extra starch and makes the chips crispy). Strain the chips and pat dry.Meanwhile, using an instant-read thermometer, bring 3 inches of duck fat to 325 degrees F in a heavy gauge Dutch oven over medium heat. Working in batches, fry the chips until they are golden and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer with a fine mesh strainer to a paper-towel-lined dish. Season immediately with a sprinkle of spice mix. Repeat until all chips are fried. Transfer to a large bowl and serve.'

S'Use a vegetable peeler to remove 2 long strips of lemon peel, being careful not to take any of the white pith, which can be bitter. Juice the lemons; you should have 1 1/4 cups of juice.Put the lemon peel, sugar, 1 cup of the lemon juice and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool. Discard the lemon peel.Put the orange and lime slices in a large pitcher (or a clean stock pot if you are making an extra-large batch for family and friends). Using a wooden spoon or muddler, lightly bruise the citrus to release some of the juices and essential oils from the skins.Stir in the orange juice, coconut water, dark and light rum, grenadine, pineapple juice, the remaining 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1 cup of the lemon syrup. (The remaining syrup can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 1 week.)Thread an orange slice, a lime slice and a maraschino cherry onto each of 8 small skewers. Fill 8 glasses with ice. Pour the hurricanes over the ice and rest a fruit skewer on each glass. Serve with tall bendy straws.'

S'Add the julienned potatoes to a bowl filled with ice water while you heat the oil.Preheat the oil in a cast iron skillet or fryer to 325 degrees F. In a small bowl, add all the spices and combine well. Remove the potatoes from the ice water and pat dry with paper towels. Fry the potatoes, in batches, for 3 to 4 minutes to cook the inside. Remove the potatoes from the oil to a bowl and bring the oil up to 350 degrees F. Add the potatoes and fry again, in batches, this time to cook the outside until golden brown. (They will not achieve the texture of a French fry, but will have a nice color and be slightly crispy).Remove the potatoes from the oil to a paper towel lined plate. Transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl or platter. Sprinkle generously with the spice mix and sprinkle with malt vinegar. Serve immediately.'

Allow the excess chocolate to drip off and lay the shells out on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper or a wire rack so they don\\'t stick.Beat the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until it is light and pale yellow in color. Add the cream cheese and beat until well combined. Add the pumpkin puree, confectioners\\' sugar, spices and lemon juice. Mix until well combined.

Rub evenly with the olive oil and sprinkle evenly with the spice mixture. Place on a baking pan and bake until cooked through and the skin is crispy, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from oven, halve and, with a small spoon, scoop out the potato, leaving about 1/8-inch of flesh in the skin. Reserve the skins and chop the potato flesh.For the filling: In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the canola oil. When hot, add the chorizo and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Add the onions and saute for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the red bell peppers, olives and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Deglaze the pan with the tequila, cooking until the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro and reserved potato flesh to combine.Place the potato skins in a pie pan or similar baking dish, nesting them against each other. Fill each half with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the chorizo mixture, top with the cheese and return to the oven. Cook until cheese is starting to melt and they are heated through, 5 to 6 minutes. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot.'

Remove them from the oven and let cool. Once cooled, peel and cut them into julienne pieces.Saute the diced bacon in a small skillet over medium-high heat until just crisp. Remove the bacon from the skillet to a paper towel.In a clear glass bowl with slanted sides, layer your salad, starting with 1/3 of the iceberg, then the beets, 1/3 of the red leaf lettuce, then the avocado. Keep going with 1/3 of the iceberg, then the onions, 1/3 of the red leaf lettuce, then the tomatoes. Finish with the final portion of iceberg, then the eggs, the final layer of red leaf, then the cucumber.  Top the entire salad with the dressing and garnish with the bacon.

S'Put the chicken into a resealable gallon-size plastic bag and pound with the flat side of a meat tenderizer to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Add the rest of the ingredients, except the peanut oil, to a food processor, fitted with the bottom blade or a blender, and pulse 5 to 6 times for 2 seconds each or until well blended. Using a new resealable gallon-size plastic bag, add the chicken and the marinade, mix well and refrigerate for 1 hour.While the chicken is marinating, prepare the Asian Mayonnaise. Remove the chicken from the marinade and wipe off the excess with a paper towel. Heat a large saute pan over high heat and add 3 tablespoons peanut oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken, stirring frequently for 3 to 4 minutes. Once cooked through, remove the chicken to a plate and keep warm. To the same pan add the red onions, carrots, red bell peppers, and bok choy and saute for 2 minutes longer. Add in the mung bean sprouts, ginger and garlic and saute for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Spread all of the naan with the Asian Mayonnaise and top with the chicken satay saute. Roll and serve immediately.'

Place the peppers in a medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to steam for 10 minutes. Peel away the blackened skins from the peppers. Cut away the stems and then seed, core and coarsely chop the peppers. Place them in a food processor and puree until smooth; reserve to the side.In a heavy-bottom medium pot, bring 8 cups water, thesalt and the roasted red pepper puree to a boil. Add the stone-ground cornmeal in a gentle stream, whisking or stirring vigorously in the same direction as you pour it in. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring continuously for 2 to 3 minutes. Cook the polenta for 35 to 40 minutes, stirring every few minutes and scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent it from sticking. When the polenta is thick, glossy and pulling away from the side of the pan, add the Pecorino Romano and butter, stirring quickly to incorporate.

S"For the lentils: Set a large saucepan over high heat. Add the lentils and toast in the dry pan until they just turn in color a little (this will give the finished lentils a little texture), 20 to 30 seconds. Add 3 1/2 cups water, the cumin, red pepper flakes, bay leaf and some salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the lentils are tender and all the liquid has been absorbed, about 12 minutes. Pour the lentils out onto a flat platter in a thin layer so they cool faster and don\\'t get too soft. Cool in the refrigerator for 5 minutes.For the salad: Drain the giardiniera, reserving 1 tablespoon of the pickling juice, and roughly chop. Wash the arugula and dry well.For the vinaigrette: In a large mixing bowl, make a quick vinaigrette by combining the reserved pickling juice with the red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, and some salt and pepper. While whisking, add the olive oil to emulsify.Assemble the salad in a large bowl by folding the giardiniera in with the lentils. Dress lightly with the vinaigrette and serve immediately over the arugula."

S'In a large pot of salted boiling water, add shrimp and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until cooked through, but not tough. Set in an ice bath. Slice shrimp in half from tip to tip and set aside. In a small bowl, pour hot tap water over noodles and set aside to soften, about 10 to 15 minutes. While noodles are soaking, prepare vegetables and herbs. Drain the noodles and cut with kitchen shears into 4-inch lengths. Set aside. Prepare an area to work easily for assembly of rolls. Line all vegetables and herbs in front of you along with shrimp and noodles. Have a roll of clear plastic wrap handy. A silicone baking sheet works well as a nonstick surface to work on, but you can use a clean cutting board as well. Fill a shallow bowl (a pie dish works great) with warm tap water and submerge 1 rice paper round into water for 10 to 15 seconds to soften. Gently remove rice paper sheet from water, place on work surface. In the center of rice paper, place 3 shrimp halves (striped side down) on rice paper. Top with 1/4 cup noodles. Top with 2 sticks cucumber, 2 sticks carrots, 2 sticks jicama, 3 pieces green onion, 3 tablespoons napa cabbage, 4 tablespoons bean sprouts, and a pinch of basil and cilantro. Finish with 3 more pieces of shrimp, striped side up. Fold rice paper up tightly over filling, fold in ends, and continue rolling, finishing seam side down. Place in plastic wrap and roll so that the rolls can set up and not stick to each other. Repeat to create the rest of the rolls. Refrigerate rolls for 20 to 30 minutes, before serving.In a small bowl, vigorously whip peanut butter with a fork until easy to stir. Stir in hoisin sauce, pomegranate juice, soy sauce, mirin and sambal until combined well. Cover and let stand at room temperature until ready to serve.When ready to serve, evenly spread remaining napa cabbage on serving platter. Remove rolls from refrigerator. Remove plastic wrap and slice in half on the diagonal. Place half the rolls on their sides on the platter and the other half on their ends, standing up. Serve with peanut sauce.'

Brush the chicken with olive oil, then rub with the spices. Heat a grill pan to medium high; grill the chicken until cooked through, about 7 minutes per side. Grill the sausage, turning, until cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool, then dice the chicken and crumble the sausage.Stretch the pizza dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round. Put on a cornmeal-dusted pizza peel or upside-down baking sheet; slide the dough onto the hot pizza stone or baking sheet and cook 7 minutes.Slide the crust back onto the peel.

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Combine the flour, the chili powder and 1 teaspoon of the pepper in a shallow dish. Combine the beer and mustard in a separate shallow dish. Mix the panko, granulated garlic, paprika, salt and remaining pepper into a third shallow dish.Dredge the fish in the flour mixture and then the beer and mustard and lastly in the panko mixture. Arrange the fish on a sheet pan, lined with a cooling rack, and refrigerate until ready to cook.For the slaw: In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, lime zest and juice, chipotle, sugar, vinegar and salt and pepper, to taste. Fold in the cabbage, onion, bell peppers, scallions, and cilantro and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Refrigerate.Spread the butter on inside of rolls and arrange, crust side down, on a rack in the oven to toast while fish cooks.Heat 1 cup oil in a cast iron or heavy bottom skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully add the fish, cooking on both sides until the coating turns golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove to a cooling rack to drain. Keep warm in the oven, if necessary.Cook\\'s Note for an alternate method: Prepare fish as above, but arrange on a sheet pan lined with a baking rack. Put the fish into the hot oven and bake until cooked through, 15 to 18 minutes. Briefly broil both sides of fillets to get a good crisp coating.To make each sandwich, arrange a piece of fish on the bottom half of the rolls and top with the slaw. Cover with another piece of bread and serve."

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the Buffalo sauce: To a medium saute pan over medium heat, add the oil, butter, jalapeno and garlic. Allow the butter to melt, and lightly saute the garlic and jalapeno for about 2 minutes. Stir in the hot sauce, chicken broth, lime juice and vinegar and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm until ready to use.For the dry rub: Combine the smoked paprika, cayenne, celery salt, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Mix to blend.Combine the chicken and 1/4 cup of the Buffalo sauce in a bowl; toss to coat. Transfer the chicken to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and sprinkle with the dry rub. Bake until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, allow to cool a bit, then chop the chicken into bite-size pieces. Set aside. (Leave the oven at 350 degrees F for the nachos.)For the pita chips: While the chicken is baking, fill a deep, heavy pot with 4 inches of oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees F over moderate heat. In batches, fry the pita wedges until golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and immediately sprinkle with salt.For the blue cheese topping: To a small saucepan over medium heat, add the milk and 1/2 cup of the smoked blue cheese. Allow the cheese to melt into the milk, then transfer the mixture to a bowl along with the remaining blue cheese and the mayonnaise, sour cream and chives. Season with salt and pepper.To assemble: In a large roasting pan, spread out half of the pita chips in an even layer.  Top with half of the chopped chicken, half of the remaining Buffalo sauce, half of the blue cheese topping and 1/2 cup of the shredded mozzarella. Repeat, ending with a generous helping of the shredded mozzarella. Place the roasting pan on the center rack of the oven and bake until the cheese has melted and the pitas have crisped and soaked up some of the hot sauce, 5 to 10 minutes.Remove from oven and sprinkle the nachos with the celery, radish, jalapeno and Parmesan. Serve immediately.'

S'For the shrimp: In a large saucepan, combine 2 1/2 quarts water with the salt, red pepper flakes, black peppercorns, garlic, bay leaves, lime and parsley. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and allow the liquid to cool for a few minutes (dropping shrimp in hot, but not boiling, water yields more tender shrimp). Prepare and clean the shrimp by running a small, sharp knife down the length of the shrimps and removing the dark vein. Add the shrimp to the poaching liquid and allow them to sit and steep in the liquid, off the heat. (Cooking the shrimp in the shell yields more flavor.) Leave for about 5 minutes until they are cooked through and completely pink. Use a slotted spoon, or spider, and remove the shrimp and drain well. Refrigerate until cool, and then peel and discard the shells before serving with the salad.For the dressing: Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, basil, parsley, green onions, lemon juice, anchovy paste and garlic in a food processor and puree. Thin with water as required, using only 2 tablespoons at a time. Taste and season with salt and pepper.For the salad: Wash the lettuces and roughly chop the romaine hearts. Tear the Bibb lettuce leaves into bite-size pieces. Cut the cucumber lengthwise down the middle, and then slice in 1/4-inch slices on the bias. Toss the salad ingredients together with the shaved red onion, pepperoncinis, green onions, bell peppers and cucumber. Top with the shrimp. Dress lightly with the dressing.'

S'Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the potatoes and cook until just tender. Drain and turn out onto a cutting board. Smash the potatoes with the side of a large knife or spatula.Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. When the pan is very hot, but not smoking, add the cipollini onions, and cook until starting to caramelize, about 4 to 5 minutes Add in the drained artichokes and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes before turning them so that they will caramelize. Add the potatoes and cook until the potatoes are starting to brown, then stir in the garlic and the thyme. Slowly pour in the chicken stock, scraping up the bits from the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with the vinegar and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary. Transfer to a platter and garnish with chopped parsley.'

S'Brine the turkey: Combine the beer, mustard and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add the turkey, seal the bag and place in a large bowl; refrigerate 45 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the pesto: Roast the bell peppers on a grill, directly over the flame of a gas burner or under a preheated broiler, turning with tongs, until blackened. Seal the peppers in a plastic bag and let cool at least 10 minutes. Peel the peppers and discard the stems and seeds (do not rinse).Pulse the peppers, basil, garlic, parmesan, pine nuts, red pepper flakes, anchovy paste, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a food processor until combined.With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil through the feed tube. Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Refrigerate the pesto if not using immediately.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the brine (do not rinse) and place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 165 degrees F, about 1 hour. Transfer to a cutting board to cool.Assemble the sandwich: Remove the meat from the bone and slice on a diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Roughly chop the marinated vegetables and mix with 1/4 cup pesto in a bowl. Slice the bread in half horizontally to make a giant bun. Pull some of the bread out of the inside of the top half to hollow it out. Spread pesto on both halves. Layer the lettuce, provolone, turkey and vegetable-pesto mixture on the bottom half of the bread, then cover with the top half. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap to squeeze the sandwich together. Refrigerate 20 minutes, then slice into pieces.Photograph by Steve Giralt'

S'In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, combine the canola oil, peppers and onion; cook for 5 minutes. Add the beef and pork; cook thoroughly, breaking up the meat as it browns. Add the garlic. Depending on the amount of residual grease, you may need to drain some of the fat from the pan. Deglaze with the red wine, then add the remaining sloppy joe ingredients (except the rolls), seasoning with 1 tablespoon each salt and freshly ground pepper. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. If the sauce gets very thick as it simmers, add up to 1 cup water to adjust the consistency. Toast the rolls and set aside.Meanwhile, prepare the onion straws: In a medium sauce pot, heat the oil to 350degrees. Whisk the egg and milk in a medium bowl. Mix the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in another medium bowl. Cut the onion in half, then slice into -inch-thick pieces; separate into short straw-like strips. Add to the milk mixture to soak. Once the oil is hot enough, remove the onions from the milk mixture, shake off excess and dredge in the flour mixture, 4 or 5 pieces at a time. Add to the pot and fry until golden brown; place on paper towels to drain. Serve the sloppy joes on the rolls and top with onion straws.'

S'Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat.Toss the apples with some vegetable oil and add to the grill. Grill the apples on all sides, about 3 minutes. Once the apples are grilled, remove from the pan and roughly chop. Add the chopped apples to a saucepan and turn the heat to medium-low. Add the sugar, brandy, butter, vanilla extract and salt. Once the butter has melted, add the apple cider. Stir to combine the ingredients and continue to cook until the apples melt into a thickened sauce, thinning with apple cider as needed, about 10 minutes.Brush the brioche with some oil and sprinkle with sugar. Place onto the grill pan and toast on both sides. Remove from the grill and slice diagonally.Transfer to shallow serving bowls. Serve immediately with the apple caramel sauce and a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream.'
