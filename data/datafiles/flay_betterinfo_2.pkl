Whisk the eggs in a bowl until light and fluffy and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into the pan and let the eggs cook until the bottom starts to set, up to a minute. With a heat-resistant rubber spatula, gently push one edge of the egg into the center of the pan while tilting the pan to allow the liquid egg to flow in underneath. Repeat with the other edges, until there\\'s no liquid left. Place the greens down the center of the omelet and roll into a cylinder.

S'Make the ribs: Heat the canola oil in a large saucepan over high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 370 degrees F. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.Put the ribs in the boiling water and cook 10 minutes. Transfer to the paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain for a few seconds. Season both sides of the ribs with salt and pepper, then fry in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.Pour the hot chicken stock into a small roasting pan and whisk in a few tablespoons of the barbecue sauce. Add the ribs and brush them with more of the barbecue sauce. Transfer to the oven and cook until fall-off-the-bone tender, 30 to 40 minutes, brushing with more sauce every 5 minutes or so.Meanwhile, make the bison loin: Season both sides of the loin with salt and pepper and coat one side with the steak rub.Heat the canola oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Sear the loin, rub-side down, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook 1 more minute. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 130 degrees F for medium rare, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before slicing into 4 thick pieces.Ladle some of the green and red chile sauces side by side on a large dinner plate; top with 1 slice of the loin. Stack 2 ribs on the other side of the plate. Garnish the loin with cilantro, if desired.'

Transfer the meat to a rack set on a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm while you make the gravy.For the gravy: Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the skillet, leaving the crunchy pieces from the breading. Add the bacon and cook until golden brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.Return the skillet to the stove over medium heat. Whisk the flour into the skillet and let cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the warm milk and continue to cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened. Stir in the heavy cream and thyme and season with salt and lots of black pepper.Serve 1 steak piece per person ladled with some of the gravy and garnished with a few pieces of bacon. Garnish with thyme and parsley sprigs.'

S'For the topping: Grease a 12-cup standard muffin tin with butter, even if using a nonstick tin. Combine the blackberries, granulated sugar and lemon juice in a small bowl. Let this macerate at room temperature for 30 minutes.Mash with a fork, then strain the juice into a small bowl and discard the solids.Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the muscovado sugar and blackberry juice and cook until the mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.Divide the caramel mixture among the cups then divide the hazelnuts over the caramel.For the filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the tin on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.Lightly flour a flat surface. Unfold each sheet of puff pastry onto the floured surface and lightly roll out with a rolling pin to an even thickness. Brush both sheets with the butter leaving a 1-inch border on the puff pastry. Divide the blackberries over the butter.Combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle over the surface of each sheet.Starting with the end nearest you, roll the pastry up snugly like a jelly roll around the filling, finishing the roll with the seam-side down. Trim the ends of the roll about 1/2 inch and discard. Slice the roll in 6 equal pieces, each about 1 1/2-inches wide. Place each piece, spiral-side up, in 6 of the muffin cups. Repeat with the remaining pastry sheet.Bake until the sticky buns are golden to dark brown on top and firm to the touch, 30 minutes. Remove from the oven onto a baking rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Use a small offset spatula to remove the buns from the tins, and place upside down on a serving platter.'

S'Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.For the parsley pesto: Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano, pine nuts, basil, garlic, parsley and some salt and pepper to a food processor. With the motor running, slowly add about 1/2 cup olive oil and process until smooth. Pulse a few times to incorporate, adding more oil if the mixture is too thick. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.For the mushrooms: Heat the canola oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Add the mushrooms, garlic and shallots and saute until brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove to a plate and reserve.Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat.For the pizzas: Portion the dough into six golf-ball-size pieces. Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like). Brush the tops of each piece with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss on the grill, oil-side down. Cook until the bottoms are an even golden brown, about 3 minutes. (The tops will also start bubbling up with air pockets.) Flip over and grill until golden brown on the other side and just firm, about a minute or so. Remove to a baking sheet.Top the pizzas with the fontina, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano, dollops of goat cheese, crushed red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Bake in the oven until the cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Top with the parsley pesto and garnish with a few more torn basil leaves.'

Remove the skin from the eggplant and transfer the flesh to a food processor. Add the garlic paste, tahini, yogurt, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and the lemon zest, oregano and smoked paprika. Process until smooth and thick. Add salt to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and let sit for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Peel, seed and dice the bell pepper.Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over the dip. Top with the diced peppers and the chopped parsley. Serve with warm pita or lavash.'

S'For the Beef: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  Heat oil and butter in a large Dutch oven over high heat.  Season the ribs with salt and pepper and cook on both sides for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Add all of the wine to the pan and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom, add all of the remaining ingredients, except the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper.  Cover with the lid, braise on the stove top or place in the oven and let braise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until very tender.   Remove the meat to a plate and strain the cooking liquids into a bowl. Clean out the pan and add the strained liquid into the pan.  Add the mushrooms and cook over high heat until reduced by 1/3.  Return the meat to the pan and cook for 5 minutes to heat through.  For the Pasta Gratin: Place milk and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes, then remove the garlic. Melt butter in a small saucepan, whisk in the flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes over low heat.  Gradually whisk in the milk and cream and cook over medium-high heat until thickened, season with salt and pepper and nutmeg, remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place cooked pasta in a buttered medium baking dish, add the sauce and stir to combine. Sprinkle the Gruyere over the top of the pasta then sprinkle the Parmesan over the Gruyere.  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil, rotating the dish, until the cheese is golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Let stand for 5 minutes.  Garnish with chives.'

S'Make the crust: Combine the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times. Scatter the butter and lard over the flour and pulse until the mixture forms large crumbs. Add 1/3 cup ice water a few tablespoons at a time, pulsing, until the dough just comes together. (Pulse in up to 2 more tablespoons ice water if the dough is too crumbly.) Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and roll out into a 12-inch round. Fit the dough into a 10-inch deep-dish fluted tart pan with a removable bottom, gently pressing it into the sides; trim the excess dough. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, make the pesto: Preheat the broiler. Put the jalapenos on a baking sheet and broil, turning, until charred, about 5 minutes. Remove the stems and seeds. Pulse the jalapenos, cilantro, garlic, pine nuts and olive oil in a food processor until the mixture has a pesto-like consistency. Add the parmigiano, and salt and pepper to taste; pulse a few more times. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the tart pan on a baking sheet, line the dough with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the edge is lightly golden, about 20 minutes. Remove the weights and parchment and bake until golden, about 20 more minutes. Let cool slightly on a rack.Meanwhile, make the filling: Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Put the goat cheese in the freezer for 10 minutes (this makes it easier to slice). Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the chorizo and break it into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon; cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon and let cool slightly. Slice the frozen goat cheese into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.Scatter the fontina, cotija, scallions, chorizo and thyme over the crust. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl; add the milk and cream and whisk until smooth. Pour into the crust and arrange the goat cheese evenly on top. Bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the edge is set but the center still jiggles slightly, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool at least 20 minutes before serving. Cut into wedges and serve with the jalapeno pesto.Photograph by Johnny Miller'

S'Bring all the ingredients to a boil in a small saucepan and cook until the sugar has melted and the mixture thickens slightly. Remove from heat and infuse for 30 minutes. Remove ginger just before using.For the cupcakes:Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12-muffin tin cups with paper cupcake liners and spray the inside of each liner and the top of the pan with nonstick cooking spray.Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves into a medium bowl.Whisk together the melted butter, brown sugar, eggs, and molasses in a large bowl until blended. Add some of the water to batter then some of the dry ingredients to the batter.  Continue alternating with the water and flour until everything is added and smooth.Fill each paper liner with 1/3 cup of the batter, about 1/4-inch below the top of the liner. Place into preheated oven and bake just until the tops feel firm and a toothpick inserted into the center come out clean, about 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops liberally with some of the ginger syrup. Allow cupcakes to cool prior to frosting.For the caramelized mango buttercream:Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in large saute pan over high heat. Add the honey and the mangoes and cook until caramelized and soft. Transfer to a food processor and process until smooth. Pass mixture through a medium mesh strainer into a bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a wire whip attachment, beat the egg yolks at medium-high speed until creamy and pale yellow, about 5 minutes. In a nonstick saucepan, combine the sugar and corn syrup. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a full rolling boil without stirring and cook until it reaches soft-ball stage (238 to 242 degrees F) on a candy thermometer. Immediately pour the mixture into a buttered measuring cup to halt the cooking. Add a small amount of the syrup to the beaten egg yolks, turn on the mixer to high speed, and beat for about 5 seconds. Continue stopping the mixer, adding syrup, and beating in the same manner until all of the syrup is incorporated and the mixture is cooled completely. Add the butter, 1 piece at a time, and beat until incorporated before adding the next piece. When all of the butter has been blended in, add the vanilla and slowly add the mango puree. Continue beating until combined. Frost each gingerbread cupcake with the caramelized mango buttercream and sprinkle with the candied ginger.'

Refrigerate for 15 minutes.Slice a very thin piece off the bottom of each peach half so they have flat bottoms. Brush the bottom and sides of a 9- by 11-inch baking dish with some of the remaining 3 tablespoons of melted butter, and then brush the rest of the butter on the peaches. Place the peaches in the pan cut-side up and about an inch or so apart. Sprinkle a little bit of salt on the peaches. Top each peach with some of the streusel. Bake in the oven until the peaches are soft and the streusel is lightly golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes, depending on how ripe the peaches are.When the peaches are almost done, put the syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer on low heat, Keep warm. Serve the peaches drizzled with some of the syrup and topped with whipped cream, if using.'

S'Put the pancetta in a cast-iron skillet and cook over medium-high heat until crisp and the fat is rendered. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.While the pancetta cooks, combine the vinegar, shallots, peppercorns, basil, tomatoes and season with salt.Prepare the charcoal grill using a chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes. When the coals are red hot and begin to turn grey, add the soaked wood chips evenly over the top of the coals.Grip each oyster, flat-side up, in a folded kitchen towel. Find the small opening between the shells near the hinge and pry it open with an oyster knife. Try not to spill the delicious juices, known as the oyster liqueur, in the bottom shell. Cut the oyster meat loose from the top shell, and then loosen the oyster from the bottom shell by running the oyster knife carefully underneath the body. Discard the top, flatter shell, keeping the oyster and juices in the bottom, deeper shell.Brush the cooking grates clean. Grill the oysters over direct high heat until the juices start to bubble and the edges of the oyster curl, 2 to 4 minutes.Spread 1 1/2 cups kosher salt evenly over the bottom of a large platter. Carefully nestle the cooked oysters in the salt and top each oyster with some of the mignonette, a few cubes of pancetta and some parsley leaves. Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil.'

S"For the pastry cream: Bring the milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat. Whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, salt and eggs in a small bowl until pale. Slowly whisk in the hot milk, and then return the mixture to the pan and whisk constantly over medium heat until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add the liqueur and cook for 30 seconds longer. Remove from the heat, stir in the butter, vanilla and orange zest. Cover with plastic wrap and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Just before using, fold in the whipped cream until combined. Keep cold.For the bomboloni: Combine 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the flour, the water, honey and yeast in the bowl of an electric stand mixer and mix. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until foamy, about 1 hour.Return the bowl to the mixer, fitted with a dough hook. Add the remaining flour, along with the milk, granulated sugar, salt and egg yolks. Mix at low speed until blended, and then add the butter. Knead at medium speed until silky but sticky, about 5 minutes. Keep in mind that the dough will not pull away from the sides of the bowl. Scrape the dough into an oiled bowl using an oiled spatula and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. The dough will not rise.For the dipping sauce: Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan. Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Add the hot cream and let sit for 1 minute. Gently whisk until smooth; stir in the orange liqueur and vanilla extract. Keep warm.For frying: Heat the canola oil in a large saucepan to 360 degrees F. Line a wire rack with paper towels. Fill a shallow bowl with 1/2 inch granulated sugar. Roll out the dough on a lightly-floured surface to a scant 1/2-inch thick. Stamp out 32 rounds using a 1/2-inch-round biscuit cutter; do not re-roll the dough. Fry the rounds, 8 at a time, until they are browned, about 4 minutes. Be sure to keep the oil between 360 degrees F and 375 degrees F. Transfer the bomboloni to paper towels to drain the excess oil, then roll them in the granulated sugar. Continue frying and rolling the remaining bomboloni.Fit a pastry bag with a 1/4-inch plain tip and fill with the pastry cream. Gently push the tip three-fourths of the way into the bomboloni and squeeze in the cream, pulling the tip out slightly as you squeeze to fill them as much as possible. Serve warm. Dip into the chocolate-orange sauce and dust with confectioners\\' sugar."

S'Make the chile oil: Combine the chopped chiles, olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan over low heat and cook 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate up to 1 week. (You will have about 1 1/4 cups chile oil.)Cook the polenta: Bring 3 cups cold water, the milk, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Gradually whisk in the polenta; whisk constantly until the mixture is smooth and begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, stirring often, until tender and thickened but still creamy, about 30 minutes. Add more hot water as needed if the mixture seems too dry. Stir in the butter and cheese.Meanwhile, make the braised greens: Heat the olive oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the greens, season with salt and pepper and toss. Reduce the heat to medium, stir in 1 cup water, cover and cook until wilted and soft, about 20 minutes. Remove the lid during the last 5 minutes to cook off any additional liquid. Stir in the red wine vinegar just before serving.Poach the eggs: Heat 3 cups water with the white vinegar until simmering in a large high-sided frying pan. Break each egg into a cup, then gently add to the water. Poach until the yolks are nearly set, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the eggs from the pan with a slotted spoon to drain the liquid and place on a plate. Season with salt and pepper.To serve, spoon some of the polenta into bowls, top with some of the greens and a poached egg per bowl. Drizzle with the chile oil and garnish with the chopped parsley.Photograph by Con Poulos'

S'For the piquillo pepper pesto: Combine the piquillo peppers, Parmesan, pine nuts, garlic, honey and red chile flakes in a food processor and process. While processing, drizzle in enough oil to create an emulsified sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve.For the tapenade: Combine the olives, anchovies and garlic in a food processor and process. While processing, drizzle in enough oil to create an emulsified sauce.For the mashed potatoes: Put the potatoes in a pot, cover with cold salted water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until fork-tender, 5 to 7 minutes.In a separate saucepan heat up the milk.Drain the potatoes well to remove any excess water. Using a ricer, mash the potatoes into a mixing bowl while they are hot. Add the butter, mascarpone and a splash of the hot milk and fold into the potatoes until incorporated. Add just enough milk to achieve a velvety consistency. Season with salt and pepper. To keep warm until serving, place the bowl over a pot of simmering water.For the bison: Preheat the broiler on high.Place a large saute pan on high heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle both sides of the bison tenderloins well with salt and pepper and place on the smoking-hot pan to sear. Once a crust has formed on the bottom, remove the meat from the pan and slice it. Return the slices to the pan. Spread the slabs of butter on top of the meat. Season with a little more salt and pepper and place under the broiler until the butter is melted.Put the arugula in a bowl, drizzle with extra-virgin oil and toss together. Season with salt and pepper.To assemble: Barely fold 2 tablespoons of the tapenade into the potatoes. Place several pieces of the bison on each plate and top with a dollop of the piquillo pepper pesto. Spoon some of the pan butter sauce over the bison and garnish with some arugula. Put a scoop of the tapenade-marbled potatoes next to the bison and garnish with minced chives.'

S'For the crab cakes: Whisk together the mayonnaise, horseradish, mustard, lemon juice and chile de arbol in a bowl and season with salt and black pepper. Add the crab and green onions and gently fold to combine with a spatula. Add enough of the quick-mixing flour to just bind the mixture together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.For the griddle cakes: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the milk, honey and egg yolks together in another medium bowl until combined. Whisk the egg whites in another medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Gently fold in the egg whites, and then 2 tablespoons of the melted butter. Mix until the batter is just smooth and let rest for 10 minutes.Heat a large nonstick saute pan, cast-iron pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Brush the pan with some of the remaining melted butter. Spoon 2 heaping tablespoons of the batter onto the pan for each johnny griddle cake. Spread the batter slightly just to even out the top using a small offset spatula. Cook until lightly golden brown on each side, about 1 minute 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve.For the hollandaise: Meanwhile, stir together the bay leaves, celery salt, mustard, 1 teaspoon black pepper, paprika, cloves, nutmeg, white pepper, allspice, cardamom, ginger and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Combine the lemon juice and egg yolks in a medium stainless-steel bowl and set over a pot of simmering water. Whisk the yolks until pale yellow and fluffy. Slowly add the melted butter, a few tablespoons at a time, and whisk until thickened. Season the sauce with 2 teaspoons of the spice mixture and the salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Keep warm in the oven until ready to use. Keep the remaining spice mixture in an airtight container and keep in a cool, dark place.For frying the crab cakes: Put 2 cups quick-mixing flour in a shallow dish and season with salt and black pepper. Remove the crab mixture from the refrigerator and divide into 8 equal patties, each about 1/2-inch thick. Dredge the patties on both sides in the flour and place on a platter.Heat 1/4 cup canola oil in a large nonstick saute pan over high heat until the oil begins to ripple. Saute the cakes until golden brown on both sides and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.Serve the crab cakes on the griddle cakes with the "Old Bay" hollandaise. Garnish with parsley.'

S'Bring milk to a simmer in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, then remove from heat and stir in sugar and salt. Pour into a large bowl and let cool slightly. While milk is cooling, dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl, stirring. Let stand for 5 minutes.Stir the yeast mixture into the milk, along with 2 tablespoons oil, eggs, and zest. Stir in 2 1/2 cups flour with a wooden spoon to make a very soft dough. Spread 1 cup flour on work surface and put dough on top, scraping it from bowl with a rubber spatula. Knead dough, incorporating all of flour from work surface and adding just enough additional flour (if necessary), about 5 minutes; dough should be slightly sticky. Transfer dough to an oiled large bowl and sprinkle lightly with additional flour. Cover bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let dough rise in a warm draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.Turn out dough onto a floured surface and roll out with a floured rolling pin until 1-inch thick. Cut out rounds with a 2-inch cutter. Place on a sheet pan and cover doughnuts with another kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. While doughnuts rise, heat oil in a deep 4-quart pot until it registers 365 degrees F on a thermometer. Fry doughnuts 2 at a time, turning once or twice, until puffed and golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Place jam in a pastry bag fitted with a 1-inch plain tip and poke the tip into the center of each doughnut (entering from the side) and squeeze in some of the jam. Ice the top with some of the ganache and sprinkle with hazelnuts.'

S"Combine the milk, vanilla bean and vanilla seeds in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove the vanilla bean. Add the hot milk to the blender and carefully blend until frothy. Add the white chocolate to the blender and blend until the chocolate is melted. Divide between 2 mugs, top with a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkle with cocoa powder.Cook\\'s Note: When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth."

S'For the relish: Soak the hickory chips in water for at least 1 hour.Put a handful of hot coals in the bottom of a smoker. Scatter the hickory chips over the top. Put a try of ice on the bottom grate. Put the cooking grate above the ice tray. Once the temperature of the smoker reaches 100 degrees F, brush the tomatoes with canola oil, season with salt and pepper and put them on the top grate. Close the smoker and smoke the tomatoes for 10 to 20 minutes, depending how smoky you want them.Coarsely chop the tomatoes, place in a bowl and add the olive oil, olives, dill, lemon juice, parsley, vinegar, honey, onions and season with salt and pepper. Let the relish sit at room temperature until ready to use.For the seafood: Prepare a charcoal grill at least 30 minutes before cooking by lighting a chimney starter filled with hard wood and let burn until covered with gray ash.Toss the shrimp and calamari with the lemon juice, olive oil and garlic and let marinate for 15 minutes. Brush the cut side of each lemon half with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.Skewer the shrimp and kalamari tentacles onto different skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the shrimp for about 2 minutes per side and the calamari tentacles for about 30 seconds per side. Put the calamari bodies directly on the grill and cook for about 15 seconds per side. Grill the lemons, cut-side down, until slightly charred. Remove to a platter.Arrange the skewers and bodies on a large platter. Top with the relish. Drizzle a little more olive oil over the top and squeeze a grilled lemon half over all. Garnish the platter with the remaining grilled lemons.'

S'For the piquillo pepper sauce: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the piquillo peppers, season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes.Transfer the mixture to a blender, and with the blender running, add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and the vinegar and blend until smooth and silky. Add the creme fraiche and a touch of honey and pulse a few times just to incorporate; taste, pulse in a bit more honey if necessary. Transfer to a bowl.For the empanadas: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with nonstick spray.Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the ham and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes; remove to a plate lined with paper towels.Reduce the heat to low. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and melt. Add the 8 whisked eggs and cook, stirring until soft curds barely form, then transfer to a bowl and quickly and gently stir in the green onion, goat cheese, ham and a generous amount of  salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking sheet.Roll each empanada wrapper on a lightly floured surface into a 7-inch round. Divide the filling among the wrappers, mounding it in the centers. Brush the edges with some of the egg wash. Fold each wrapper over the filling to create half-moon shapes and seal by pressing the edges together firmly with a fork.Transfer the empanadas to the prepared baking sheet and brush with egg wash. Cut a few small slits in the top of each empanada to create steam vents. Bake until golden, about 10 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes and serve with the piquillo pepper sauce.'

The longer the refrigeration time, the better.For the spicy pomegranate-rioja red wine vinaigrette: Combine the pomegranate juice, wine, peppercorns, thyme and 1 tablespoon honey in a small saucepan. Cook over high heat until the syrup is reduced to 1 cup. Remove the syrup from the heat and cool. Remove the thyme and peppercorns with a spoon.Whisk the remaining 1 tablespoon honey, mustard and vinegar in a bowl. Whisk in 1/2 cup of the red wine syrup. Cover and refrigerate the remaining syrup to keep up to 1 month. Yield: about 1 cup.Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling.Preheat a charcoal grill for direct grilling. Remove the lamb from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper on both sides. Thread 2 or 3 pieces of the lamb onto each skewer, so the lamb lays flat.

Drizzle the lamb with some Spicy Pomegranate-Rioja Red Wine Vinaigrette and let sit for 5 minutes.For the mint-almond relish: Mix the almonds and mint and sprinkle with salt and pepper just before serving.Drizzle the remaining Spicy Pomegranate-Rioja Red Wine Vinaigrette over the lamb and sprinkle with the mint-almond relish.'

S'For the meatballs: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook until soft, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.Whisk together the Parmesan, parsley, oregano, eggs, 3 tablespoons cold water, the sauteed garlic and onions and some salt and pepper in a large bowl until combined. Add the chuck and pork and gently mix together until combined. Begin adding breadcrumbs a few tablespoons at a time until the mixture just holds together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. The longer you let the mixture sit, the more the flavor develops.For the fresh pasta: In a food processor, combine the flour and eggs. Pulse until it comes together as a dough. Remove and knead until smooth. Let rest for at least 30 minutes.For the tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Increase the heat to high, add the tomatoes and oregano and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning (adding a pinch of sugar if needed) and stir in the basil.Form the meatball mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Heat the remaining 1 cup of oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the meatballs and fry until golden brown on all sides.Add the meatballs to the sauce, reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking until the meatballs have cooked through and the sauce has thickened more, about 15 minutes longer.To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt.Roll out the dough in portions using a pasta roller. Cut out spaghetti using a pasta cutter and place the fresh pasta on a tray lined with parchment.Boil the pasta until al dente, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss the pasta with some of the warm sauce and a little bit of pasta water in a saute pan.Transfer the sauced pasta to a platter and top with the meatballs (using a slotted spoon). Ladle the remaining tomato sauce over the spaghetti and meatballs. Dollop ricotta on top and grate lots of Parmesan over the top. Garnish with fresh basil sprigs and parsley leaves.'

S'Combine the masa mix, salt and warm water in a large bowl and mix until a smooth dough forms. Pull off pieces of dough and roll them into balls about the size of a ping pong ball.Cut a quart size resealable plastic bag open down both sides, to form a rectangle. Use the bag to line the tortilla press as you shape the tortillas so they do not stick: Lay 1 side of the plastic over the bottom of the press. Place a ball of dough in the center, and fold the other side of the plastic over the dough. Shut the top of the tortilla and press firmly down on the dough to shape the tortilla.Meanwhile, pour 2 inches of vegetable oil into a large deep pot and heat to 350 degrees F.Drop a tortilla into the hot oil and, using a metal spatula, repeatedly douse the tortilla with the hot oil until it begins to puff up. Flip it over and, using the spatula, make an indentation in the center of the tortilla to form a taco shape. Transfer to paper towels to drain.Fill each taco with 2 tablespoons of shredded chicken, guacamole, beans and cheese or your favorite filling.Yield: 12 to 15 taco shells'

S"Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat, until smoking. Saute the garlic, bell pepper, chiles, and bread cubes until lightly browned, about 2 minutes each.  Stir in half of the walnuts. Remove each ingredient with a slotted spoon as it is done.  Deglaze the pan with the vinegar.  Place all sauteed ingredients and the deglazing liquid into a food processor and blend until smooth. Add the remaining walnuts, raisins and apricots and puree until smooth and thickened, season with salt and pepper.For the Grilled Pork Tenderloin: Preheat grill or oven to 400 degrees F.  Season both sides of the pork tenderloin with salt and pepper.  Spread a thin layer of the Walnut Remesco down the center, fold each side over the filling, and tie with butcher\\'s twine.  Brush each tenderloin with oil and grill for 4 to 5 minutes on each side or until just cooked through.  If using oven, heat oil in a large ovenproof saute pan over high heat.  Sear the meat on both sides, until golden brown, place in oven and roast for 10 minutes.   Let rest 10 minutes before slicing.For the Caramelized Date Sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and the sugar and cook until caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.   Increase the heat to medium-high.  Add both wines and reduce the mixture to 1/4 cup.  Add the dates, stock and molasses and continue cooking until reduced to 2 cups, and reaches the consistency of a slightly thick sauce, about 30 minutes, keep warm.To serve, slice tenderloin into 1-inch thick pieces and top with a little Remesco sauce and drizzle with date sauce."

S'For the crab cakes: Combine the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, stone-ground mustard and paprika in a large bowl. Add the crab, parsley and green onions and gently mix to combine. Begin adding the breadcrumbs 1/4 cup at a time until the mixture just holds together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.For the sour orange sauce: Combine the orange juice, lime juice, vinegar, chile powder, cumin and garlic in a medium saucepan, bring to a simmer over high heat and cook until reduced by half; season with salt and pepper. Strain into a bowl, add the honey, oregano and zest and let cool to room temperature before serving.For the mango-avocado relish: Combine the avocado, mango and red pepper in a medium bowl. Toss with the cilantro, canola oil, lime juice and salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.To finish the crab cakes, divide the crab mixture into 8 cakes and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops of the cakes with mayonnaise and place overlapping layers of sliced plantains on top. Season the tops with salt, pepper and chile de arbol.Heat 3 tablespoons of canola oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer. In batches, add the crab cakes plantain-side down and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until just heated through, about 5 minutes longer. Repeat with the remaining crab cakes, adding up to 3 tablespoons more oil if needed.To serve, spoon some of the sour orange sauce into the bottom of 4 shallow bowls. Top with 2 crab cakes followed by some mango-avocado relish. Garnish with cilantro leaves.'

S'Combine all ingredients in a bowl of a food processor and mix until combined; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove from refrigerator 15 minutes before using. For the salad:Heat the grill to high. Place the bulgur in a large bowl; add the boiling water, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, stir and let sit at room temperature until tender, about 25 minutes. If any water remains, place in a fine sieve and press down on it. Put the vegetables in a large bowl, toss with a few tablespoons of canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the vegetables on the grates of the grill in a single layer. Grill the peppers until charred on all sides, place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let steam for 10 minutes. Remove the skin, seeds and core and coarsely chop. Grill the zucchini for 3 to 4 minutes per side until slightly charred and just tender, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Grill the asparagus for 3 to 5 minutes per side or until just crisp tender. Remove from the grill and cut on the bias into 1/2-inch pieces. Grill the tomatoes until charred all over and just tender, about 5 minutes total.Place all of the vegetables, including the jalapeno and the parsley in the bowl with the cooked bulgur. Whisk together the zest, lemon juice, olive oil and salt and pepper in small bowl. Add the dressing to the salad and toss to combine. Let sit at room temperature until serving. For the Barbecue sauce:Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the wine, increase the heat to high and cook until reduced to about 1/2 cup. Add the ketchup and the remaining ingredients and cook until thickened and slightly reduced, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool slightly. For the salmon:Heat grill to high, cast iron grill pan over high heat, or large nonstick saute pan over high heat. Brush salmon on both sides with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill for about 4 minutes per side, brushing with some of the bbq sauce every 30 seconds. Remove from the grill, place on a platter and brush with more of the sauce. Serve on top of cracked wheat salad and place a tablespoon of the hazelnut butter on top of each salmon fillet. Garnish with parsley leaves and serve.'

S"For the pickled grilled green onions: Heat a charcoal or gas grill to high for direct grilling.Brush the green onions with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until charred and just wilted, turning once.Combine the vinegar, 3/4 cup water, the sugar, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, the coriander seeds, garlic and jalapeno in a medium nonreactive saucepan, bring to a boil and cook until the sugar has melted. Remove from the heat, transfer to a nonreactive bowl, add the green onions, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.For the duck sliders: Prepare the Caja China according to the manufacturer\\'s directions. Make some balls out of aluminum foil to prop up the Caja China rack that sits over the drip pan--the rack should be slightly elevated in the drip pan so that the ducks stay above the fat that will render into the pan during the cooking process. Put the rack on the foil in the pan.Brush the ducks on both sides with canola oil and sprinkle with the ancho powder and some salt and pepper. Put the ducks in breast side-down on the rack, put the cover on and put the hot coals on top. Add about a chimney full of cold coals to the hot--they will catch and cook as the hot coals burn. Add more cold coals as needed to keep the fire hot throughout the cooking process. Cook the ducks for 45 minutes.Remove the coals and lid, brush the backs of the ducks with some of the barbecue sauce, flip over, brush the tops with more of the sauce and continue cooking until golden brown and cooked through and the skin is crispy, about 45 minutes more.While the ducks cook, combine the remaining barbecue sauce, the apple juice concentrate, sugar, fennel, cinnamon, star anise and habanero in a medium saucepan and cook until heated through and slightly reduced, about 30 minutes; stir in the cilantro. Remove 1/4 cup of the sauce and set aside until cool enough to add to the creme fraiche.Remove the ducks to a cutting board, let rest for 15 minutes and shred into bite-sized pieces. Put the meat in a bowl and toss with the sauce.Whisk together the creme fraiche, cooled reserved sauce and the lime zest and juice in a medium bowl.To assemble, spread some of the creme fraiche mixture on the top and bottom buns. Mound some of the duck on the bottom of the buns, top with some of the pickled green onions, put the bun tops on top and enjoy."

S'Special equipment: Dough cutter, 9-by-13-inch baking dishFor the dough: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly butter the sides and bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.Using a dough cutter, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and buttermilk powder if using, in a large bowl. Cut in the butter using your fingers or a dough cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the buttermilk or 1 1/2 cups cold water if using buttermilk powder, and gently mix until the mixture just begins to come together.Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 16-by-12-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Position the dough so the short side is facing you.For the filling: Brush the surface of the dough with the softened butter. Combine the sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread the mixture evenly over the butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Spread the chopped pecans over the sugar mixture.Fold 1/4-inch of the short side in. Roll the dough up tightly into a log starting on the shorter side. Using your hands to apply pressure, roll the log back and forth a few times to seal the dough. Slice 1/4-inch of dough off each side to even the ends, then cut the log into 8 equal pieces.For the topping: Combine the butter and 1/4 cup water in a medium nonstick saucepan over high heat and cook until the butter is melted. Whisk in the brown sugar and cook until smooth and bubbly. Reduce the heat to low, whisk in the heavy cream and cook for 1 minute. Add the salt, then remove from the heat and keep warm.Pour the warm topping into the prepared baking dish. Scatter some additional chopped pecans evenly over the surface. Place the buns in the baking dish, cut-side down. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes.Remove from the oven and let cool on a baking rack for 5 minutes. Carefully invert onto a platter.'

S'Two hours before grilling, remove the provolone cheese from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature. Letting the cheese sit out in the air will allow the cheese to form a crust and make it easier to grill.Preheat the grill to medium-high direct heat, leaving some space for indirect cooking.Grill the chorizo, turning occasionally, until nicely charred and hot inside, about15 minutes. Chop roughly and set aside.Heat a griddle over the direct heat. Lightly brush the top of the cheese with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the griddle, seasoned-side down, and cook until the cheese is dark golden brown and crusty, about 5 minutes. Brush the top lightly with oil, season again, carefully flip over and move the griddle to the indirect heat. Continue cooking until the bottom begins to turn light brown and the cheese is melty, covering if need be. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with the oregano and red pepper flakes.Brush the bread on each side with some olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill over direct heat for about 1 minute per side-the bread should be crisp and a bit charred outside, but chewy inside.Heat a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and melt. Crack the eggs into the skillet, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with another pan. Cook until the whites are set and the yolks still runny, about 3 minutes.While the eggs cook, whisk together the vinegar and mustard in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil until emulsified. Taste and whisk in the honey if desired. Put the rocket, tomatoes and onions in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle some vinaigrette around the sides of the bowl and gently toss to coat.To serve: Smear some cheese on the toasted bread. Top with an egg, chopped chorizo, a drizzle of olive oil and parsley leaves. Serve each crostini with some rocket salad.'

S"For the crab broth: In a 2 gallon stock pot, saute the shallots and onions in olive oil until soft. Add the crabs and saute for a few minutes. Add the wine and reduce by half. Add the tomatoes, peppercorns, bay leaf and enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and just barely simmer for 30 minutes, skimming off any impurities. Strain through cheesecloth and discard the solids.For the salmon: Preheat the oven to 400 to 450 degrees F. Remove the planks from the water and, using tongs, sear over a medium-flame until charred. (Alternatively, place in the oven until charred, about 15 minutes.) Remove and brush the top with oil.Rub the salmon with oil and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the salmon to the prepared planks, wrap the planks and salmon with parchment paper, and roast the salmon to medium-rare doneness, about 10 minutes. Remove the salmon to a platter and let rest before flaking with a fork.For the chowder:  Melt the butter in a Dutch oven. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook until soft. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the Dungeness Crab Broth, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced and thickened.Place the heavy cream in a saucepan and reduce by half. Add the reduced cream to the chowder and heat through. Stir in the thyme and parsley. Fold in the salmon, crab, and potatoes. Ladle the chowder into individual bowls and top with a Whole-Grain Crouton and drizzle with Pinot Glaze.Cook\\'s Note: Untreated cedar planks are available at hardware stores."

S'For the bacon confit: Blot the bacon with paper towels and place in a small roasting dish Combine the cinnamon, cloves, pepper and thyme in a small bowl. Rub the bacon with the spice mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours.Melt the bacon fat in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the bacon and cook slowly until golden brown and crisp on one side, about 10 minutes. Turn the bacon and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook the bacon until crisp, about 10 more minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl, drizzle with a splash of vinegar and garnish with parsley. Reserve the bacon fat for the mustard greens.For the roasted tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Mix together the oil, thyme and some salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes in a baking dish and drizzle with the oil mixture. Then sprinkle with the sugar. Bake the tomatoes until they are completely softened and start to wrinkle, 30 to 40 minutes.For the cheese grits: Bring 6 cups of water and the milk to a boil in a medium saucepan and season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the grits and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, whisking constantly. Cook until mixture is thick and tender, about 30 minutes, adding more water, if needed. Mix in the Cheddar and  Pecorino-Romano until thoroughly incorporated. Season with some salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.For the sauteed baby mustard greens: Heat the butter and 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the red pepper flakes and garlic and cook until the garlic is softened, about 1 minute. Add the mustard greens and season with salt and pepper. Toss just to coat with the fat. Add a splash of water and cook until the greens are just wilted, about 2 minutes.For the shrimp: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add 8 to 10 shrimp, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until well-seared and crisp but just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining shrimp.On a serving platter or individual plates, spoon and slightly spread a mound of hot grits (if they have gotten too stiff, thin them a bit by whisking in hot water over low heat). Spoon the tomatoes on top, then add the greens and bacon. Top with the shrimp.'

Add the garlic paste to a medium bowl along with the anchovy, vinegar, pepper flakes and some salt. Whisk to combine, then slowly whisk in the olive oil until emulsified. Add the tomatoes, olives, capers and chopped basil and gently stir to combine. Let the relish sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to allow flavors to meld.Heat a grill to high. Rub both sides of each swordfish steak with two of the basil leaves, leaving some of the now-bruised basil on top of each steak. Brush the steaks with the canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill, basil-side down, until charred, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until opaque throughout, another 4 minutes. Remove to a platter and immediately spoon the relish over the fish.'

S'Whisk together all ingredients in a medium bowl and season with salt to  taste.  Truss the turkey. Place turkey on a work surface, breast side up. Rub it with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.      Heat the grill to medium heat.  Have the rotisserie shaft fitted with 1 spit fork.  Making certain that the turkey is centered, push the rotisserie shaft through the turkey between the legs, exiting at the neck. Slide the spit fork onto the shaft. Insert the tines of the spit forks into the turkey, screw side up, and tighten the screws to secure firmly. Set the rotisserie shaft in place in the rotisserie ring. Loosen the retaining loop at the handle, and let the counterweight assembly hang down to counterbalance the weight of the breast.  The rotisserie should rotate so that the heavy side of the turkey rotates down to the bottom. Swing the counterweight assembly so that the counterweight is directly opposite the heavy side of the turkey. Tighten the retaining loop. The counterweight travel should stick out a little bit above the shaft handle and retaining loop. You may need to adjust the travel of the counterweight as the food cooks, or if the motor sounds like it is straining. Insert the pointed end of the rotisserie shaft into the motor. Set the rotisserie shaft into the ring. Cover the grill, and turn the motor on.      Grill the turkey 11 minutes per pound if unstuffed.  During the last 30 minutes, baste the entire turkey with 1 cup of the marinade.  Remove the turkey from the grill and immediately brush with the remaining glaze.  Let rest for 20 minutes before slicing. To determine if the turkey is thoroughly cooked, insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the inner muscle of the thigh, making certain not to touch the bone, and check that the temperature is 175 to 180 degrees F.'

S'Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. F. Lightly grease 2 (9-inch) cake pans and line the bottoms with disks of parchment paper.Sift the flour, cocoa, ancho chile powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper. Sift again.Place butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat at high speed until smooth and fluffy. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating until each is incorporated. Continue beating, scraping down the sides of the bowl if necessary, until light and fluffy, about 5 more minutes. With the mixer on low speed, beat in 1/3 of the flour mixture. Beat in the vanilla, half of the buttermilk and half of the coffee, then another 1/3 of the flour mixture. Beat in the remaining buttermilk and coffee, then the remaining flour mixture.Spread the batter evenly in prepared pans. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the centers spring back when lightly pressed. Cool the cakes in the pan on a wire rack.Whipped Ganache Filling:Bring heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan. Place chocolate in a large bowl, pour heavy cream over and let sit for 1 minute. Gently whisk until combined.Place the ganache over a bowl filled with ice water to chill slightly, whisking occasionally. Remove ganache from the ice and whip with a whisk until light and fluffy. Fold in the toffee bits.Coconut Buttercream:In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a wire whip attachment, beat the egg yolks at medium-high speed until creamy and pale yellow, about 5 minutes.In a nonstick saucepan, combine the sugar and corn syrup. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a full rolling boil without stirring and cook until it reaches soft-ball stage (238 to 242 degrees F) on a candy thermometer. Immediately pour the mixture into a buttered heat proof measuring cup to halt the cooking.Add a small amount of the syrup to the beaten egg yolks, turn on the mixer to high speed, and beat for about 5 seconds. Continue stopping the mixer, adding syrup, and beating in the same manner until all of the syrup is incorporated and the mixture is cooled completely.Add the butter, 1 piece at a time, and beat until incorporated before adding the next piece. When all of the butter has been blended in, add the vanilla and coconut milk and continue beating until combined.Assembly:Slice each cake in half horizontally to make 4 layers total. Place the first layer down and spread with a thin layer of the Ganache. Repeat with the remaining cake layers and ganache, ending with a cake layer.Spread a thin layer of the buttercream over the entire cake. This is called a crumb coat. Chill the cake for about 30 minutes. Frost entire cake with the remaining buttercream.  Press coconut into the sides of the cake.'

S"Special equipment: six 6-inch pie tinsFor the pie crust: Pulse the flour, confectioners\\' sugar and salt in a food processor. Add the butter and pulse until a coarse meal forms. Drizzle in the yolk and pulse until the mixture reaches a cornmeal-like consistency. Remove from the processor and gently divide the dough among six 6-inch pie tins. Gently press the dough into the tins and up against the edges. Poke the bottom of the crusts a few times with a fork. Butter 6 squares of aluminum foil (large enough to cover the pie crusts) and press one, butter-side down, into each crust. Freeze until hard, 20 to 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and toast in the oven, tossing once, until toasted, about 3 1/2 minutes.Bake the pie crusts in the oven until the edges are golden, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool and then carefully remove and discard the foil. Set the pie crusts aside until ready to fill.For the coconut pastry cream: Bring the coconut milk and cream of coconut to a simmer in a medium saucepan.Add the sugar and cornstarch to the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Whisk until combined, then add the egg and yolks and whisk on high speed until the mixture reaches a pale yellow color and it drops down like ribbons when you lift the whisk.Add a couple of ladlefuls of the hot coconut milk mixture to the egg mixture and whisk to temper the eggs, then pour all of the egg mixture into the coconut milk saucepan and return to medium heat. Whisk vigorously and constantly until the custard starts to boil and thicken.Place a bowl over an ice bath and strain the pastry cream into the bowl to remove any lumps. Place a layer of plastic wrap on the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate over the ice bath until cool and firm, 15 to 20 minutes.Whip the heavy cream in a medium bowl until it reaches stiff peaks, refrigerate until ready to use.For the salted lime caramel: Add the sugar to a medium saucepan. Pour 1/4 cup of water and squeeze the lime juice over the sugar, swirling the pan to fully moisten. Cook over medium-heat until bubbling and deep amber in color, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, carefully whisk in the cream. Whisk in the butter piece by piece. Finish with a sprinkling of fleur de sel.For the candied key lime slices: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat. Make a simple syrup: Heat the sugar and 1 cup of water in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool.Slice the key limes into 1/16-inch slices with a mandolin. Brush the slices with the simple syrup and place in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet making sure they do not overlap. Bake for 30 minutes. Allow to cool before using.For serve: Whisk the coconut custard until it is light and smooth. Gently fold in the whipped cream. Spoon the mixture into the pie crusts. Top with the toasted coconut flakes. Place a spoonful of the salted lime caramel on each plate and place a pie on it. Drizzle with more salted lime caramel and garnish with a candied key lime slice."

S'Heat the grill to medium. Pull the outer husks down the ear to the base. Strip away the silk from each ear of corn by hand. Fold husks back into place and tie the ends together with kitchen string. Place the ears of corn in a large bowl of cold water with 1 tablespoon of salt for 10 minutes. Remove corn from water and shake off excess. Place the corn on the grill, close the cover and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, or until kernels are tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove the husks and eat on the cob or remove the kernels. How to remove corn kernels from cob: To remove kernels from cobs of either raw or cooked corn, stand cob upright on its stem end in a large pan, holding tip with fingers. Cut down the sides of cob with sharp paring knife, releasing kernels without cutting into cob. Run dull edge of knife down the cob to release any remaining corn and liquid.Yield: 4 servings'

S'For the jerk rub: Combine the coriander, ginger, sugar, garlic and onion powders, salt, habanero powder, thyme, allspice, cinnamon, cloves and black pepper in a medium bowl. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the rub for the pork belly. Reserve remaining rub in an airtight container for another use.For the hash: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Sprinkle the pork belly generously with salt and black pepper and place in a medium high-sided saute pan with a lid. Add the stock, cilantro sprigs and smashed garlic and bring to a simmer. Cover with the lid and transfer to the oven. Let the pork belly braise until really tender, about 2 hours 30 minutes. Uncover and let it cool to room temperature in the stock. Remove the pork, pat it dry and put it in a large shallow bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and place another bowl on top with a can of beans or tomatoes to weight it down. Chill for 8 hours and up to 24 hours.Remove the pork belly from the refrigerator and remove the skin. Cut the pork into 1/2-inch cubes. Toss the cubes in the 2 tablespoons jerk rub. Heat a few tablespoons of canola oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the pork and cook until golden brown and crispy. Remove the pork with a slotted spoon to a plated lined with paper towels.Add the onion, red pepper and poblano to the pork drippings in the pan and cook until soft. Add the chopped garlic and cilantro and cook for another minute. Add the sweet potatoes and more oil if needed. Season with salt and black pepper and cook the potatoes, pressing firmly with a spatula, until they are deep golden brown on the bottom. Add the pork, turn the potatoes and cook, pressing with the spatula, to brown the other side of the potatoes and heat the pork.Heat the butter in a nonstick or cast-iron pan over medium heat. Carefully crack the eggs into the pan and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Fry until the edges begin to set and the yolk is slightly firm. Flip them over and cook for another minute longer. Or, instead of flipping, cover the eggs with a lid for 1 to 2 minutes to "baste"; the yolk should still be runny. Divide the hash among 4 plates and top each with an egg. Drizzle with hot sauce and garnish with more cilantro.'

S'Measure flour and salt into medium bowl. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter or your fingers until it is the size of peas. Cut in the lard in the same way. Add water and mix until the dough begins to hold together. Divide dough into 2 balls, 1 just slightly larger than the other. Flatten each into a disc, about 5-inches in diameter and about 1-inch thick. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill. Pull dough from refrigerator 15 minutes before assembling pie. Roll the slightly larger disc into a circle measuring about 12 inches in diameter and line a 9-inch pie plate with this dough. Set aside. Roll the second disc into a 9 by 13-inch rectangle. Cut into strips for lattice. Set aside. Make pie filling.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Pull berries from the freezer and let thaw for 15 minutes. In a small bowl combine the sugars, tapioca, cornstarch, salt, and nutmeg. Pour the sugar mixture and the lemon juice over the berries. Stir to coat evenly. Pour the mixture in to the prepared dough lined pie pan, mounding the berries slightly in the middle. Assemble the lattice on top of the pie. Roll the bottom crust up over the lattice edges and crimp as desired. Brush the lattice with a thin coating of milk.  Bake for 10 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, and continue to bake for approximately 50 minutes, or until the middle of the pie is bubbling. During this cooking time, brush the lattice with milk and sprinkle with granulated sugar. If the edges start to brown too much, cover loosely with foil or a tart ring turned upside down. Remove the pie from the oven and cool on rack. Let the pie cool for 3 to 4 hours to let the filling set up. Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla bean ice cream if desired.'

S'For the herb-bacon oil: Combine the olive oil and herbs in a bowl.Heat the canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat, add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Reserve the bacon pan drippings. Add the bacon to the herb oil, season with salt and pepper, and set aside.For the hash: Heat the bacon drippings in the cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook about 30 seconds.Meanwhile, toss the sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts and turkey in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the potato mixture, stir once to incorporate the onion and garlic, and then press firmly with a spatula against the bottom of the pan. Cook, pressing occasionally, until the bottom is browned and crispy, about 4 minutes, reducing the heat if the mixture starts to get too dark. (If the mixture seems dry, add some butter around the edges.)Once the bottom is browned and crispy, flip the hash in chunks and press again to brown some of the top side.For the poached eggs: While the hash is cooking, bring about 4 inches of water to a simmer in a deep skillet. Add the vinegar. Break each egg into a separate ramekin. Slip the eggs into the water and cook until the whites are set and the yolks still runny, about 4 minutes.Right before the eggs are done, divide the hash among 4 or 6 plates. Remove each egg with a slotted spoon, blot it dry on a clean side towel, and put it on top of the hash.  Drizzle each serving with some bacon-herb oil and serve.'

S'Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the bread cubes on a large baking sheet in a single layer and toast until lightly golden brown on all sides, turning a few times, about 15 minutes. Remove and let cool slightly. Bring cream, 1 cup of sugar, and lemon zest, to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk together the eggs and yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk the warm milk into the eggs and add the vanilla. Transfer the bread cubes to a 9 by 15-inch baking dish, pour the custard mixture over and press on the bread to submerge in the custard. Let the mixture sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the bread to absorb more of the custard. Place the baking dish inside a larger roasting pan and fill the outer pan with warm water halfway up the sides of the baking dish. Bake until puffed around the outside but still slightly jiggly in the center, about 45 minutes. Remove from the water bath and let rest at least 15 minutes before serving. Toss the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the blackberries. Serve bread pudding topped with macerated berries and Meyer Lemon Whipped Cream.'

S'Prepare salmon by removing all scales and gills. Clean cavity and pat dry with paper towels.Place the salmon on a large platter and stuff the cavity with a few sprigs of thyme and dill and season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with lemon juice and let marinate for 1 hour. Prepare venison by removing any hair and bone bits left behind after butchering.Combine the marinade ingredients and pour over meat in either a resealable plastic bag or a baking dish. Marinate for 4 hours in the refrigerator, if possible. Can be refrigerated overnight.For the mango salsa:Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and set aside.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, if possible. Brush salmon lightly with olive oil and place salmon on very hot grill, for approximately 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove from grill and place on a serving platter or cutting board. For venison sauce: In a hot saute pan over low to medium heat, add olive oil, butter, onion, and pine nuts.  Saute for a couple of minutes to sweat the onions. Do NOT overcook. Raise heat to medium, add 1 cup of red wine and reduce by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the chocolate and blueberries. Once the chocolate has melted, remove from heat. Place venison on hot grill... LEAVE THEM ALONE for about 2 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove from the grill and place on a serving platter or cutting board. Serve the salmon and venison steaks with mango salsa and blueberry chocolate sauce.If desired, serve with a fresh green salad on the side. Present the meal on a large rustic wooden cutting board (rugged) with kale, lemon wedges and a rustic (also rugged) baguette.

S"For the Spanish spice rubbed pork butt: Combine the paprika, salt, coriander, fennel, mustard seeds and pepper in a bowl. Rub the entire pork with the spice mixture. Cover the pork and refrigerate overnight.For the sherry vinegar-honey glaze: Whisk the honey, vinegar, salt and pepper in a bowl.Prepare the Caja China according to manufacturer\\'s directions. Drizzle the pork with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the pork in the Caja China and roast until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees F, about 3 1/2 hours. At 175 degrees F, begin basting the pork with the Sherry Vinegar-Honey Glaze about every 15 minutes. Removing the top of the Caja China will slow the cooking process considerably.Cook the pork until it reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, about 1 hour. Remove the pork from the Caja China and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Let the pork rest for 20 minutes before slicing or pulling.Cook\\'s Note: Once you start glazing the pork, don\\'t add too much hot charcoal to the top of the Caja China, or the glaze may burn."

S'Fill a high-sided, 5-quart pot halfway with canola oil. Preheat the oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F.Sprinkle the shrimp on both sides with salt and pepper. Coat a large saute pan with enough oil to coat the bottom and place on medium heat. Add the shrimp and saute, flipping once, until they begin to curl and turn opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garlic to pan halfway through and cook briefly, making sure not to burn. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and cook off the liquid. Remove from the heat and pour the contents onto a tray to cool.Bring the pan back to the heat and add a little more oil. Add the Brussels sprouts, cook to sweat and then season with salt and pepper. Add the chiles and cook for another minute. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Place the cooked shrimp on the cutting board and run knife through it for a rough chop. Place into a mixing bowl. Mix in the Brussels sprouts, chopped peanuts and Thai basil. Season with salt and pepper.To build the egg roll, lay the wrapper flat on the work surface like a diamond, with one corner facing you. Brush a little egg wash over the top corner and edges of the wrapper. Lay some of the stuffing in the bottom third of the wrapper in a horizontal log, leaving a 1-inch gap on either side. Fold the bottom corner over the stuffing, then fold the sides inside like an envelope and roll all the way to the top. Place the egg rolls on a sheet tray until ready to fry.Fry the egg rolls in the oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oil carefully and place them on a paper-towel-lined sheet tray. Place on a platter and serve with the Sesame Ginger Dipping Sauce.'

S'Special equipment: a deep fryer or a Dutch ovenFor the balsamic glaze: Put the vinegar in a small nonreactive saucepan over high heat and cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in the honey and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool to room temperature.For the roasted red pepper tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft. Add the garlic and red chile flakes and cook for 1 minute.Add the tomatoes and their juices, salt and pepper, bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes begin to soften, 20 minutes. Coarsely mash the tomatoes with a potato masher. Add the pureed piquillo peppers and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally. Add the oregano and half of the basil and cook until the sauce is thickened, about 25 minutes more. Taste for seasoning and stir in the parsley. Reserve the remaining basil for serving.For the eggplant: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 15-by-10-by-2-inch baking dish and set aside. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or deep fryer to 365 degrees F.Combine the fontina and shredded mozzarella in a bowl and set aside. Combine the breadcrumbs and panko in a large shallow baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Place the flour in a medium shallow baking dish or large plate and season with salt and pepper. Whisk the egg and 2 tablespoons of water together in another medium shallow baking dish and season with salt and pepper.Season each eggplant slice on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge each eggplant slice in the flour, tapping off the excess, then dip it in the egg and dredge it in the breadcrumb mixture. Shake off any excess breading and transfer the eggplant to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining eggplant slices. Fry the eggplant slices in batches until tender and golden brown on each side and tender, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a baking sheet lined with paper towels and season with salt.Lay 8 slices of the fried eggplant in the prepared baking dish, top each slice with about 1/4 cup of the roasted red pepper tomato sauce, 1/4 cup of the combined cheeses and a tablespoon of the remaining chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper. Take 4 of the topped eggplant slices and place them on the other 4 so you have a total of 4 eggplant stacks. Top each stack with one more eggplant slice, 1/4 cup of the sauce, some of the basil and a few thin slices of the fresh mozzarella. Bake until the cheese melts, 8 to 10 minutes. Place under the broiler and broil until the fresh mozzarella is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Top with the remaining chopped fresh basil and drizzle with the balsamic glaze.'

S"Heat a grill to medium high.For the Bobby\\'s rub for beef and pork: Combine the ancho chile, coriander, mustard, paprika, black pepper, salt, chile de arbol, cumin and oregano in a bowl. Set aside 2 tablespoons for the mushrooms. (Store the remaining spice rub, tightly covered, in a cool, dry place for up to 6 months.)For the portobello mushrooms and rajas: Brush the mushrooms generously with canola oil and season the gill sides with the reserved 2 tablespoons spice rub. Brush the Anaheim chile and bell peppers with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Put the mushrooms spice-side down on the grill. Put the peppers on the grill and cover the grill. Grill the mushrooms, turning once, until a knife inserted in the thickest part meets no resistance, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Grill the Anaheim chile and bell peppers, turning, until charred on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes (the Anaheim will take a few minutes less than the bell peppers). Transfer the peppers and chile to a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.For the tortillas and toppings: While the peppers rest, warm the tortillas on the grill a few seconds on each side; keep warm.Remove the skins and seeds from the bell peppers and chile. Thinly slice the peppers, chile and mushrooms and combine in a bowl. Add the cilantro, olive oil, scallions, Fresno chiles, lime juice and salt and pepper.Fill the tortillas with the vegetable mixture and top with queso fresco and a squeeze of lime."

S"To make the ketchup, heat the oil in a small nonreactive saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and chile flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add the ketchup and oregano and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar and basil and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and let cool to room temperature or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.To make the fricos, combine the cheese and flour in a bowl. Heat an 8-inch nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the cheese mixture and cook until light brown on the bottom. Turn over with a heat-proof silicone spatula and continue cooking for another 10 to 15 seconds. Remove to a plate to cool. Wipe out the pan with a paper towel and repeat to make 3 more fricos. Divide the meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with salt and pepper. Cook the burgers, using the oil. See how Bobby cooks perfect burgersPlace the burgers on the bun bottoms. Add some of the arugula to each burger, top with the fricos, and then add a dollop of the ketchup. Top with the bun tops and serve immediately.Toasted Burger BunsI think the taste and the texture of buns are best when lightly toasted. To toast a bun on a grill, grill pan, or griddle, split the bun open, place it cut side down on the grill, and grill until light golden brown, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, you can place the split bun halves cut side up on a baking sheet and cook them under a preheated broiler until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Keep a close eye on them and don\\'t let them get too brown or else that texture will take on a life of its own and defeat the purpose of starting with a soft bun."

S'Bring the milk to a simmer in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, then remove from the heat and stir in the sugar and salt. Pour into a large bowl and let cool slightly.While the milk is cooling, dissolve the yeast in 2 tablespoons warm water in a small bowl, stirring. Let stand for 5 minutes.Stir the yeast mixture into the milk mixture along with the oil, lemon zest and eggs. Stir in 2 1/2 cups of the flour with a wooden spoon to make a very soft dough. Spread 1 cup of the flour on a work surface and put the dough on top, scraping it from the bowl with a rubber spatula. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, incorporating all of the flour from the work surface and adding just enough additional flour (if necessary); the dough should be slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to an oiled large bowl and sprinkle lightly with additional flour. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll out with a floured rolling pin until 1 inch thick. Cut out rounds with a 2-inch cutter. To make ring shapes, cut out doughnut holes with a 1-inch cutter. Place on a baking sheet, cover the doughnuts with another kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.While the doughnuts rise, heat about 10 cups vegetable oil in a deep 4-quart pot until it registers 365 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Fry the doughnuts 2 at a time, turning once or twice, until puffed and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Yield: 16 doughnuts'

Drain and let cool before cutting each potato in 1/2-inch-thick slices. While the potatoes are cooking, combine the vinegar, garlic, mustard, basil and 1/2 cup of the oil in a blender and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Heat your grill to medium. Brush the potato slices on both sides with the remaining 1/4 cup oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the potatoes on the grill, close the cover, and grill until lightly golden brown and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Carefully transfer the potatoes to a flat surface. Make stacks by layering the following: 1 slice potato, 1 tablespoon goat cheese, 1 slice potato, 1 tablespoon goat cheese, 1 slice potato. Place the stacks back on the grill, close the cover, and grill until the cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute. Transfer the potatoes to a platter, drizzle some of the vinaigrette on and around the potatoes, and sprinkle with the chives.'

S"Preheat the oven to 300 degrees and set a rack in the middle.In a small mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and the melted butter.  Divide the mixture among 4 (1-cup) custard cups and press down to form a crust on the bottom.In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream and 1 tablespoon of the remaining tablespoon of sugar.  Scald and remove from the heat.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the yolks, the remaining tablespoon of sugar, vanilla, and rum.  Whisk lightly, just to combine.Whisking lightly, gradually drizzle the scalded cream mixture into the egg mixture to warm it without scrambling the eggs.  Strain the mixture and pour into custard cups.  Place 6 raspberries in each cup, dunking them so they are coated with custard.Arrange the cups in a roasting pan and pour in hot water halfway up the sides. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the custards are set.  Cool in the pan, then refrigerate, covered, up to 2 days ahead.If you like, sprinkle a light layer of sugar over each custard and place under a preheated broiler for about 2 to 4 minutes, watching that they don\\'t burn.  Serve immediately after glazing."

Bring to a boil and cook until the butter is completely melted and the sugar is dissolved. Add the flour, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon anise seeds and quickly beat with a wooden spoon until a ball is formed and the mixture becomes dry, about 2 minutes.Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat for one minute to allow some of the steam to escape the mixture and to cool slightly before adding the eggs. Add the eggs, one a time, beating every time until each is incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and beat for 20 seconds longer. Scrape the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.Combine the remaining 1 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon anise in a baking dish.Working in batches, pipe 6-inch strips of the dough into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, turning once. Remove with a slotted spoon or spider to the prepared paper towel-lined baking sheet. Let the churros drain for 30 seconds and immediately toss in the sugar mixture.

S"Cook\\'s Note: Bull\\'s blood is a variety of heirloom beet, typically grown and used for its dark purple leaves.For the bacon and tangerine dressing: Strain the tangerine juice through a mesh strainer into a small saute pan. Bring the juice to a simmer and reduce to a syrup consistency, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Cook the bacon in a little olive oil until  crispy, about 7 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain, reserving the fat from the pan in a small bowl.Whisk together the mustard, 2 tablespoons of reserved bacon fat, the tangerine zest and the tangerine reduction in a small bowl.For the crostini: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Toast the fennel seeds in a small saute pan over medium heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes, and then grind in a spice grinder. Brush both sides of the baguette slices with a little olive oil and season generously with salt, black pepper and ground fennel seed. Grill until the bread is toasted, 3 minutes per side. Remove and reserve.For the tartar: Combine the yellowtail, parsley, capers, vinegar, mustard, chipotle puree, scallions, thyme, shallots, lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl. Adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper. Plate with the ring mold.Drizzle some of the dressing around the plate and garnish with reserved bacon pieces. Dress the bull\\'s blood and chervil with some of the vinaigrette, season with salt and black pepper, and use to garnish the tartar. Serve with the crostini on the side."

Place the ears of corn in a large bowl of cold water with 1 tablespoon of salt for 10 minutes.Remove corn from water and shake off excess. Place the corn on the grill, close the cover and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, or until kernels are tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove the husks and eat on the cob or remove the kernels.How to remove corn kernels from cob: To remove kernels from cobs of either raw or cooked corn, stand cob upright on its stem end in a large pan, holding tip with fingers.

S'For the gnocchi: Whisk together the ricotta, egg, lemon zest, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Add the flour and mix until a soft, slightly wet dough forms, adding more flour if needed. Remove the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead until the dough just comes together. Form into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 day.With lightly floured hands, shape the dough on a well-floured surface into two 1-inch-thick ropes. Cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces with a lightly floured knife. Arrange in a single layer on a lightly floured parchment-lined baking sheet.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi, in batches if needed, until they float, 2 minutes. Drain well.For the corn sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the garlic, shallots and chile and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the corn and saute for 5 minutes.Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil and cook until the corn begins to soften, about 10 minutes. Remove the corn to a blender with a slotted spoon and add 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Blend on low speed, pulsing a few times, until smooth, adding more liquid if necessary to create a sauce consistency.Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook until warmed through and thickened, about 15 minutes.For the prosciutto: Heat the oil in a small saute pan until it begins to shimmer. Fry the prosciutto one slice at a time until crisp, about 1 minute.Remove the prosciutto to a plate lined with paper towels and season with pepper. Let cool slightly and crumble into pieces.To serve: Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat until it begins to turn a light amber color. Add the drained gnocchi and cook until lightly golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.Spoon some of the sauce into shallow bowls and top with the gnocchi. Garnish with shaved Parmesan, crumbled prosciutto and basil.'

S'In a small bowl place the chocolate. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat bring the cream to a simmer and then pour over the chocolate. Let the chocolate mixture sit for 30 seconds and then whisk until smooth, keep warm.For the Bread Pudding:Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment and add the diced brioche. Drizzle with the melted butter and toss to coat. Bake in the oven and lightly golden brown. Removing and tossing several times. This should be repeated for about 12 minutes. Once the bread has evenly browned, remove and let cool slightly. Meanwhile in a medium saucepan over high heat, combine the cream, coconut milk, sugar and vanilla bean and seeds in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer and whisk until the sugar has dissolved. Add the chopped bittersweet chocolate and whisk until melted. Strain the mixture into a medium size bowl. In a separate medium bowl whisk together the eggs and yolks and slowly add the warm chocolate mixture, whisking as you add.Place half of the brioche cubes in a single layer in the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the custard mixture over the bread and half of the ganache. Sprinkle with half of the coconut. Press down on the bread, allowing the liquid to soak in. Place the remaining bread cubes over the top, add the remaining custard and ganache and again, press down to completely submerge the bread. Top with the remaining coconut, cover and let sit for at least 30 minutes before baking. While the bread is sitting continue to check and press down on the bread so that it is completely submerged with the custard mixture. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Uncover the bread pudding, and place the baking dish in a larger roasting pan. Fill the outer roasting pan with warm water until it comes halfway up the sides of the baking dish. Place the roasting pan in the oven and bake until the sides are slightly puffy and the center is slightly set (but still jiggles a bit).For the Passion Fruit Sauce:Into a small saucepan cut the passion fruit in half and scoop out centers (including the seeds). Add the sugar, orange juice and rum and let cook over high heat until sugar has dissolved and sauce has thickened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and chill in the refrigerator.For the anglaise:Split vanilla bean. In a small heavy saucepan bring milks and vanilla bean half just to a boil and remove pan from heat. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean halves into milk and reserve pod for another use. In a bowl whisk together yolks and sugar. Add milk in a stream, whisking, and transfer custard to saucepan. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring, until thickened slightly and an instant-read thermometer registers 170 degrees F. Pour custard through a fine sieve into a metal bowl set in a large bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring occasionally, until cold. Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, its surface covered with plastic wrap.Remove the pan to a baking rack and let sit for 15 minutes. Spoon some of the coconut anglaise into a bowl and drizzle with the passion fruit sauce. Top with a large scoop of the bread pudding and serve.'

S'Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil, add the onions, cook for 1 minute and drain well. Transfer to a bowl. Combine the vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, let cool slightly then pour the mixture over the onions. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Stir in thyme before serving. For the sauce:Put the orange juice in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil. Using a paring knife, make a small slit in the center of the habanero and add to the orange juice along with the allspice berries. Cook until thickened and reduced to about 1 cup. Strain into a bowl and let cool slightly. Add the zest and vinegar and season with salt, pepper and honey, to taste, if needed. For the basil oil:Combine the oil and basil in a blender and blend for 2 minutes. Strain into a bowl and season with salt and pepper.For the fish:Whisk together the flour, salt, pepper and enough water to make a batter with the consistency of crepe batter. Let sit 5 minutes. Heat 2-inches of oil in a medium high-sided saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Put the flour in a large shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper. Season the fish with salt and pepper and dredged lightly in the flour, tapping off excess. Dip the fish in the batter and let excess drip off. Fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Transfer to a platter, drizzle with the vinegar sauce and basil oil and top with some of the pickled red onions. Garnish with basil leaves.'

S'For the pickles: Combine the vinegar, dill, sugar, salt, coriander and mustard in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool for 15 minutes. Put the cucumbers in a medium bowl, pour the pickling liquid over, cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.For the sour orange glaze: Combine the orange juice and lime juice in a small nonreactive saucepan over high heat and cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Whisk in the honey and vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Let cool slightly.For the pork: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Season the pork with salt and pepper and rub with the steak rub. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature.Heat the oil over high heat in a cast-iron pan or oven-proof skillet until it begins to shimmer. Add the pork and cook until a crust has formed on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Brush liberally with the sour orange glaze and transfer the pan to the oven. Brush with the glaze every few minutes, and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 145 degrees F, about 10 minutes. Remove the pork to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Slice the pork thinly.For the garlic mayonnaise: Combine the mayonnaise, mustard, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Whisk together and let sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.For the serrano ham: Heat the oil in a small saucepan until it reaches 350 degrees F. Add the ham one slice at a time and cook until crisp, about 30 seconds. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.To serve: Spread the top and bottom of each bun with the garlic mayonnaise and top each piece with 2 slices of cheese. Put some pickles on the bottom piece of bun. Top with 4 to 5 slices of the pork and 2 slices of the fried ham. Combine the tops and bottoms to make the sandwiches.Brush the outsides of the buns with the butter. Heat a cast-iron pan over low heat. Put 2 sandwiches in at a time, top-sides down, and press with a brick wrapped in foil, or put foil over the top of the sandwiches and weigh them down with another heavy cast-iron pan. Cook until the bread is crispy, then flip over and continue cooking until the bottom is crispy and the cheese has melted, 6 to 8 minutes total. Slice in half and eat.'

S'Using a vegetable peeler remove the zest of the oranges and lemons. Cut the zest pieces into thin slices, then finely chop or grind and set aside.  Peel and discard remaining white part of the peel from fruit.  Chop fruit pulp, reserving any juice and set aside.  Place the peels, water and baking soda in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the reserved fruit and juice and cover.  Simmer an additional 10 minutes.Stir the 6 cups sugar into the prepared fruit in the saucepan.  Add the butter to reduce foaming.  Bring mixture to a full rolling boil on high heat stirring constantly. Stir in pectin. Return to a boil and boil exactly 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in pectin. Remove from heat and skim off any foam with metal spoon.Toss the blueberries with honey.  Place into a small saucepan and cook over medium heat for 1 minute.  Scoop out blueberries and add to marmalade. Reduce liquid to a syrup and stir into the finished marmalade.  Serve at room temperature.For the biscuits:Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Using a dough cutter, combine until ingredients are incorporated. Scatter the cold butter pieces over the top of the flour mixture and continue to combine until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the buttermilk and pulse until the mixture just begins to come together.Scrape the dough onto a lightly flour counter. Pat the dough into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut out biscuits. Press together the scraps of dough, and repeat process. Place the biscuits on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper; brush the tops with cream and sprinkle with black pepper. Bake the biscuits for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly golden brown.

S'For the chocolate BBQ sauce:  Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring once or twice, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ketchup, beer, brown sugar, molasses, mustard, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle chile and some salt and pepper and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the ancho powder, cocoa powder, paprika and chile de arbol. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Stir in the chopped chocolate and cook, stirring occasionally, another 5 minutes.Transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth; season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour into a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature. The sauce will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator stored in a tightly-sealed container.For the steak: Stir together the ancho powder, cocoa powder, salt, espresso, celery seed, coriander, oregano, paprika, allspice, mustard seed and black pepper in a small bowl.Remove the steak from the refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking. Season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Rub one side with some of the rub. Store the remaining rub in an airtight container in a cool dark place for up to 2 months.Heat the canola oil in a cast-iron pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the steak rub-side down and cook until a crust forms, about 4 minutes. Turn over, reduce the heat to medium, and continue cooking, brushing with the chocolate BBQ sauce every few minutes, until the bottom is golden brown and the steak is cooked to medium-rare, 4 to 5 more minutes.  Remove to a cutting board, brush with more of the sauce and let rest 10 minutes. Slice into thick slices.For the cheesy green eggs: Crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the eggs and cook, stirring constantly, until soft curds form. Just before the eggs are softly set, stir in some salt and pepper and the Cheddar. Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro and green onions.For the burritos: Spread each tortilla with some sour cream. Add some chocolate BBQ sauce, cheesy green eggs, steak, salt and pepper, and more sauce if desired. Roll up into burritos and serve with additional eggs, sauce and steak on the side if desired.'

Combine salt, flour, curry, and cayenne in a small bowl. Remove the milk from the heat and add the flour mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the sides. Place pan back on the heat and cook for about 20 to 30 seconds until the mixture becomes a little dry. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl and let cool slightly. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, adding another only when the previous has been incorporated. Add the asparagus and both cheeses to the dough and mix until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon rounded tablespoons of the mixture onto the sheet pan. Bake in the middle of the oven until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the puffs from the parchment and serve immediately.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the bread cubes in an even layer on a large baking sheet and bake, stirring a few times, until light golden brown, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool, then transfer to a very large bowl.Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Combine the mushrooms on a baking sheet, toss with 3 tablespoons canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven, stirring several times, until soft and golden brown, about 25 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate.Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan and place it back on the stove over high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add 3 cups chicken stock and the herbs, season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer.Add the mushrooms to the bowl with the bread, then add the stock mixture, the bacon and the eggs; season with salt and pepper and gently stir until combined. The mixture should be very wet; add more stock if needed. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Add the stuffing and cover with foil. Bake 20 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until golden brown, 30 to 40 more minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 minutes before serving.Photograph by Linda Pugliese'

S'Prepare the chicken: Whisk together the buttermilk, chile powders, paprika, coriander, garlic, onion powder and cinnamon in a large baking dish. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours, turning a few more times.Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Put the chicken on a baking rack set over a baking sheet. Return to the refrigerator and let sit, uncovered, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.Meanwhile, make the glaze: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the mangoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until broken down and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add the white wine and cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.Carefully transfer the glaze mixture to a blender; add the pineapple juice, orange juice and the chile de arbol powder and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain into a bowl and season with the honey and salt and pepper. The mixture should be a thick puree. If it is too thick, thin it with a touch of water. Let cool to room temperature before serving.Grill the chicken: Heat your grill to medium for indirect grilling. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.Brush the chicken on both sides with the oil; season with salt and pepper. Put the chicken, skin-side down, on the hotter side of the grill (direct heat) and grill until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the chicken and continue grilling until the bottom is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Move to the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat), close the cover and continue grilling until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast (not touching the bone) registers 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 more minutes. During the last few minutes, brush with some of the glaze.Remove the chicken to a platter and drizzle with more of the glaze. Tent loosely with foil and let rest 10 minutes before serving.Photograph by Jennifer Causey'

Grill, covered, until charred on all sides and soft, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the peppers to a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let steam for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put the tomatoes in a grill basket and grill, covered, tossing occasionally, until charred in spots and softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside.Brush the portobellos with canola oil and season on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill on both sides, covered, until a paring knife inserted in the center meets no resistance, 3 to 5 minutes per side. While the portobellos are cooking, peel, seed and thinly slice the peppers.Turn the portobellos gill-side up and top each with some of the goat cheese. Grill, covered, until the cheese softens, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a platter and top each mushroom with some tomatoes and peppers.

S'Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Whisk together pomegranate molasses, horseradish, mustard, salt, and coarsely ground black pepper. Set aside and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before using to allow the flavors to meld.Remove the neck, heart and gizzard from inside of the turkey. Rinse the bird inside and out with cold water and pat dry. Rub the entire surface of the bird with the butter and season well (including the cavity) with salt and pepper. Truss the turkey and place breast-up on a rack in a large roasting pan. Roast for about 45 minutes, until slightly golden brown. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue roasting, basting with some of the chicken stock every 15 minutes, for about 1 hour, 15 minutes longer. (An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh should register 160 degrees F.) During the last 15 minutes of roasting, stop basting with the chicken stock and brush the entire turkey with 1 cup of the pomegranate glaze. Remove the turkey from the oven, brush with the remaining glaze, loosely tent and let rest 15 minutes before slicing.'
