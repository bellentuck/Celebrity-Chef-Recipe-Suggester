Rub each chicken thigh with some of the spice rub and brush with the oil.Prepare the kettle grill or smoker for indirect grilling, with medium-high heat over the coals. Put the chicken skin-side down over the direct heat and cook until just crsipy, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook, about 2 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a platter.Scatter the apple wood chips over the coals. Return the chicken to the grill over the indirect heat. Cover the grill. Cook the chicken between 250 and 275 degrees F, until a thermometer inserted in the chicken registers 160 degrees F, 45 to 50 minutes. At about 30 minutes, brush the chicken with some of the sorghum-chile glaze. Just before removing the chicken from the grill, brush with more of the sorghum-chile glaze again.Transfer the chicken to a platter and drizzle some of the reserved sorghum-chile glaze on top.'

S'In a large bowl or baking dish, whisk together 1 quart of the buttermilk, 2 tablespoons salt, 2 teaspoons of chile de arbol powder, or hot sauce, and a little bit of pepper, if desired. Add the chicken pieces, turn to coat, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Place the remaining 2 cups of buttermilk in a bowl. Stir together the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika, and 2 teaspoons chile de arbol powder (or cayenne) in a large bowl. Divide flour mixture among 2 shallow platters and season generously with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off. Dredge in the second plate of flour and pat off the excess. Put the chicken pieces on a piece of waxed paper or on a clean platter while you heat the oil. Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast iron skillet; the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces. Serve hot.Yield: 4 to 6 servings'

S'Make the sauce: Bring the balsamic vinegar to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until reduced by about half, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Add the onion and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the ketchup and 3 tablespoons water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook 5 minutes. Add the reduced balsamic vinegar, the chile powder, paprika, mustard, red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle chile, brown sugar, honey and molasses. Simmer until thickened, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender or transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce into a bowl and let cool to room temperature. (The sauce will keep for 1 week refrigerated in a sealed container. If it gets too thick, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons water.)Let the steak sit 30 minutes at room temperature before grilling. Meanwhile, preheat a grill to high. Brush the steak with the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Grill over direct heat until browned on one side, about 3 minutes, then turn over and grill until the other side is browned, about 3 more minutes. Move to a cooler part of the grill, away from direct heat. Baste with the sauce and continue grilling, turning several more times, until medium rare, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and loosely tent with foil. Let rest 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make the cheesy bread: Brush the cut side of each piece of bread with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill on both sides. Remove from the grill and top each piece with a mound of grated monterey jack cheese. Put the bread on a piece of aluminum foil and return to the grill to melt the cheese. Transfer to a serving platter.Thinly slice the steak against the grain. Arrange the steak slices on the bread and garnish with sliced scallions.Photograph by Con Poulos'

S"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line one 12-cup and one 6-cup muffin pan with paper or foil cupcake liners.Make the cupcakes: Sift the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt together three times. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer at high speed for 15 seconds until combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until each is incorporated. Continue beating until light and fluffy, about 6 more minutes. With the mixer at its lowest speed, beat in one-third of the flour mixture. Beat in the buttermilk and vanilla, then another one-third of the flour mixture. Beat in the coffee and then the remaining flour mixture. Fill the muffin cups halfway and bake for 25 minutes, or until the centers spring back when lightly pressed. Set the pans on a rack to cool.Make the peanut butter filling: Beat the butter and peanut butter with an electric mixer at medium speed until blended. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the confectioners\\' sugar. Increase the speed to high and beat for 3 to 5 minutes, until smooth and fluffy. Spoon the filling into a pastry bag fitted with a medium plain tip. Insert the tip into the top of each cooled cupcake and squeeze approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons filling into each cupcake.Make the ganache frosting: Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until scalding. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit 1 minute, then whisk until smooth. Let sit 10 minutes, until thick but still pourable. Dunk the tops of the cupcakes into the frosting to coat, then place on a rack and sprinkle with the chopped peanuts. Transfer to the refrigerator for 20 minutes to set.Photograph by Gentl & Hyers"

Let sit at room temperature while you prepare the steak and onions.Remove the steaks from the refrigerator 20 minutes before grilling.  Heat the grill pan over high heat until it begins to smoke. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Brush both sides of the steaks with canola oil and season well with salt and pepper.  Arrange the steaks on the grill pan and let cook until golden brown and charred, about 5 minutes.  Flip the steaks, lower the heat to medium and continue cooking to medium-rare doneness (130 degrees F internal temperature on an instant-read thermometer), about 4 minutes longer.  Remove from the heat and arrange on a serving platter. Loosely tent with foil and let rest while you grill the onions.Brush the onions on both sides with canola oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Grill until golden brown and slightly charred on both sides and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Separate the slices into rings and add to a small bowl.  Add half of the vinaigrette to the onions and gently toss to coat.

S'For the swordfish: Stir together 8 cups water, the salt, sugar and peppercorns in a deep pot. Bring to a boil just to dissolve the salt and sugar; cool completely. Submerge the swordfish in the brine. Refrigerate for 12 hours.Remove the swordfish from the brine and rinse well under cold water. Pat dry and allow to air dry for at least 1 hour. The exterior of the fish should feel sticky to the touch before smoking.Prepare a smoker with maplewood chips and to an internal temperature of 200 to 225 degrees F.Brush the fish very lightly with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Smoke the fish for about 2 hours, adding chips through the first hour as necessary. You can keep adding chips the second hour if you prefer a much smokier flavor. Transfer the smoked fish to a large platter.For the clam sauce: Remove the meat from half the clams and chop roughly. Heat the canola oil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the garlic and chile and cook for a few seconds. Add the chopped clams and cook, stirring, for another minute. Add the wine, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half.Add the whole clams, cover the saucepan and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the clams open, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the butter. Remove from the heat and stir in the chopped parsley and lemon zest. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over and around the smoked swordfish, and scatter the parsley leaves on top.'

S'For the broth: Bring the wine and 1 cup water to a boil in a stockpot over high heat. Add the clams and cook until opened, about 5 minutes. Remove clams with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Discard any clams that do not open. When cool enough to handle, remove the clams from the shell and coarsely chop.Bring the broth back to a boil, add the mussels and cook until the mussels open, discarding any that do not open. These mussels are added just to flavor the stock. After you remove them, eat them or reserve for another use (remove from the shell, store in a container with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate for up to 1 day).Strain the cooking liquid through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth into a bowl. You should have 2 cups of liquid.For the breadcrumbs: Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat until it begins to shimmer, add the anchovies and cook until melted into the oil. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly golden brown, and then season with salt and pepper.For the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine to al dente according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and then drain the pasta well.Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and chile flakes, and cook until soft, 1 minute. Add the clam broth and cook until reduced by half.Whisk in the butter, creme fraiche and chopped clams, and cook until thickened. Add the basil, parsley, oregano and zest, and season with salt and pepper. Add the pasta and cook, tossing constantly, until the pasta is coated. If the mixture is too dry, add some of the reserved pasta water.Divide the pasta among the bowls, and top with some of the breadcrumbs. Garnish with parsley leaves.'

S'For the turkey: Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 1 hour before roasting.Combine the butter, sage, rosemary, thyme, and parsley in a food processor and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Season the cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper and fill the cavity with half of the carrots, celery, and onion. Rub the entire turkey with the herb butter and season liberally with salt and pepper.Put 4 cups of the chicken stock in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat.Place the remaining vegetables on the bottom of a large roasting pan. Put the turkey on top of the vegetables, put in the oven and roast until lightly golden brown, 45 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue roasting, basting with the warm chicken stock every 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 160 degrees F, about 2 to 2 1/4  hours longer. Remove the turkey from the oven, transfer to a baking sheet, tent loosely with foil and let rest 20 minutes before slicing.For the sage gravy: Strain the cooking liquid from the roasting pan into a medium saucepan (should be about 4 cups, if not, add more stock to make 4 cups). Add the neck, bring to a boil, add the sage leaves, remove from the heat and let steep for 15 minutes. Remove the sage leaves.Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and cook until reduced. Whisk in the sage-infused stock and cook until thickened and smooth, about 5 minutes. Season with the salt and pepper and chopped sage.'

S'Make the tomato sauce: Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, and the basil and cook until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth; return to the saucepan and add the parsley, honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste.Make the cauliflower Mornay sauce: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut off the cauliflower florets and put in a small roasting pan. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add 1 1/2 cups water to the pan, cover with aluminum foil and bake until very tender, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven.Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook 30 seconds. Whisk in 4 cups milk, increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, whisking; cook, whisking, until thick, about 5 minutes. Add the cauliflower, reduce the heat to low and cook 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, then puree until smooth. Strain into a clean saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Whisk in the nutmeg, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste and cook 1 minute. Thin with some of the remaining 1 cup milk, if needed.Make the lasagna: Soak the porcini mushrooms in 1 1/4 cups boiling water, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook 5 minutes; drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Combine the ricotta, egg, 1/2 cup parsley, 1 teaspoon thyme and 1/2 cup romano cheese in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.Heat the olive oil in a saute pan over high heat. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the assorted mushrooms and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the shallots and cook until golden, about 6 minutes. Drain the porcini mushrooms, reserving the liquid, then coarsely chop and add to the pan; cook 1 minute. Deglaze with the porcini soaking liquid and cook until completely reduced, about 6 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons thyme and 1/4 cup parsley and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.To assemble the lasagna, ladle some of the tomato sauce into a 10-by-14-inch baking dish. Ladle on some of the cauliflower sauce; top with 4 noodles. Top with some of the ricotta mixture, then some of the mushroom mixture, fontina and some of the remaining romano cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat to make 3 more layers, ending with a layer of noodles, cauliflower sauce and romano. Put the dish on a baking sheet, cover with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until bubbly, 30 to 40 more minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with parsley and let sit 15 minutes before serving. Serve with the remaining tomato sauce.Photograph by Johnny Miller'

S'For the cheesy hash browns: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Heat the butter and canola oil in a cast iron pan over high heat until the butter begins to sizzle. Add the onion and cook until soft and slightly caramelized.While the onions are caramelizing, put the potatoes in a large pot of cold, salted water, bring to a boil and cook until nearly tender, but a knife inserted into the centers still meets a little resistance, 10 to 12 minutes, or cooked through. Drain well and smash with the back of a wooden spoon.Add the potatoes to the onions packing it evenly with the back of a metal spatula to form a cake. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the underside is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Invert a plate or baking sheet without sides over the pan and carefully invert the potato cake onto it. Carefully slide the potato cake back into the skillet and cook until the bottom is just set and pale golden brown, about 4 minutes. Spread the cheese on top, cover the pan with a lid and let melt. Transfer the potato cake to a cutting board cheese-side up and cut into wedges. Garnish with chopped fresh chives.For the roasted tomatoes with bread crumbs: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the tomato halves in a lightly buttered baking dish, cut-side up, drizzle with olive oil , honey, and sprinkle with panko bread crumbs and paprika. Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper and roast for 20 minutes. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. Drizzle with olive oil.For the sauteed mushrooms: Heat the canola oil into a saute pan and saute the mushrooms until soft. Add the fresh thyme leaves and season with salt and pepper.For serving: Arrange on a platter the fried eggs, cooked bacon, cooked sausage, cheesy hash browns, roasted tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, toasted brown soda bread and butter.'

S"For the whipped cream cheese: Put the cream cheese, vanilla and orange zest in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment and whip until light and fluffy.  Add the cold heavy cream and whip until soft peaks form. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.For the french toast: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Whisk together the sugar and eggs until smooth. Whisk in the milk, cream, cinnamon and vanilla until combined.Make the French toast in 2 batches. Heat 2 tablespoons each of the butter and oil in a large saute pan over medium heat until the butter is melted and the oil begins to shimmer.Place 4 slices of the bread in the custard mixture and let sit on both sides until soaked through. Remove with a slotted spatula to allow the excess custard to run off. Cook until the toast is golden brown on both sides and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.Transfer the French toast to a baking rack set over a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you cook the second batch with the remaining butter, oil and bread. Keep French toast warm until ready to serve.For the banana foster topping: Heat the butter in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to sizzle. Whisk in the brown sugar and cinnamon and cook until the sugar has melted and the mixture has thickened slightly.Add the bananas and cook until slightly softened. Remove from the heat and add the rum and banana liqueur. Return to the heat and cook until the alcohol has burned off.Serve 2 slices of toast per person, topped with some of the bananas and their syrup, a dollop of the whipped cream cheese, some fresh berries, and sprinkling of confectioners\\' sugar, if using. Garnish with mint."

Season with salt and pepper . Pour into a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.For the ribs: Stir together the paprika, dry mustard, ground ginger, star anise, allspice, salt, pepper and Thai chile flakes in a bowl. Rub the ribs on the top side, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.Preheat a charcoal grill with about 80 briquettes off to 1 side, or in a kamado-style ceramic charcoal cooker with the ceramic plate removed. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator 1 hour before grilling.Combine 4 cups water, the soy sauce, ginger and garlic and divide between two heavy disposable pans.If using a charcoal grill: Put one disposable pan of steaming liquid on the bottom grate of the grill on the opposite side of the coals. Put the top grate on and heat well. Put the ribs on the grill, top-side down, directly over the hot coals and cook until golden brown and a crust has formed, about 10 minutes. Move the ribs to the other side of the grill, over the liquid, and place the other disposable pan with steaming liquid next to them over the coals. Put the lid of the grill on and open the vents on top halfway. Cook until the ribs are tender and juicy, about 2 hours. Add water as necessary to prevent scorching, and coals to keep the internal temperature between 225 and 250 degrees F.If using the kamado-style ceramic charcoal cooker: Remove the ceramic plate and heat the grill rack. Put the ribs on the grill, top-side down, directly over the hot coals and cook until golden brown and a crust has formed, about 10 minutes. Remove the ribs and rack and put in the ceramic plate. Put one disposable pan of steaming liquid on the plate, then return the rack and the ribs to the grill. Cover and cook until ribs are tender and juicy, about 2 hours. Add water as necessary to prevent scorching, and coals to keep the internal temperature between 225 and 250 degrees F.If using charcoal, finish the ribs by moving them back over the hot coals and turning and basting with sauce for 15 to 20 minutes. If using the ceramic charcoal cooker, leave the plate in and brush liberally with sauce for 15 to 20 minutes before removing from the grill.Combine the sesame seeds and sprinkle the tops of the ribs. Cut the ribs apart and put on a platter. Scatter the green onions over the top and serve.'

S'Trim the artichoke leaves and stems and blanch in salted, boiling water with a little of the lemon juice. Use only enough water to cover. When tender remove from the water, cool, and clean. Save the leaves for another use. Discard the hairy choke and save the hearts and stem for the dish. Slice into 1/8-inch slices. In a saute pan over high heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and saute the fennel in it until tender. Add salt and pepper, to taste, remove and keep warm. Wipe out the saute pan and add in the peanut oil and bring to medium high heat. Salt and pepper the fillets and brown on 1 side about 5 minutes. Turn and saute 2 more minutes and remove from the pan. Add the sliced garlic and 1/2 of the remaining olive oil and cook 2 minutes. Add the sliced artichokes and saute until starting to brown. Add the tomatoes, white wine, stock, lemon zest and juice, and remaining olive oil and reduce the liquid by 1/4. Return the fish to the mixture, add the capers and basil, and check salt and pepper. Cook 2 more minutes until fish is just flaky and check salt and pepper. Divide the fennel among 6 warm dinner plates and top with the fillets. Sauce with the vegetable mixture and serve.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.For the grillades: Cut the steak in half. Sandwich each half between 2 pieces of plastic wrap or wax paper, and pound to an even 1/8-inch thickness. Sprinkle the steak on both sides with salt and pepper, and cut into 2-inch pieces.Mix the paprika, New Mexican chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and chile de arbol powder in a small bowl until combined. Put the flour in a shallow baking dish and season it with salt and pepper.Heat the butter and canola oil in a large, high-sided saute pan over high heat. Working in batches, coat the steak pieces in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess, and brown them on both sides in the hot fat. Transfer the steak to a plate as you finish each batch. Add the onions, poblano and red pepper to the pan, adding more oil if needed, and cook until the vegetables are very soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the spice mixture and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the chicken stock, tomatoes, thyme and bay leaf, and bring to a boil. Return the beef to the pan, cover and transfer to the oven to cook until tender, about 45 minutes.When done, remove the beef to a plate and cover to keep warm. Using potholders, move the pan to the stovetop and set over high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened into a gravy, about10 minutes. Season with a splash of vinegar. Add honey, salt and pepper to taste; stir in the parsley. Before serving, return the grillades to the pan, cover and warm them up over medium-low heat.For the grits: Heat the butter and canola oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft. Add the corn, season with salt and pepper and cook for a few minutes. Add the milk and 3 cups water and bring to a boil. Slowly whisk in the grits until well combined and continue whisking until smooth. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and smooth, about 45 minutes; add more water as needed to keep the mixture creamy. Remove from the heat, and whisk in the cheddar and Parmesan and the green onions.To serve: Use a slotted spoon to transfer the grillades to a shallow platter. Pour over some of the gravy. Top with the grits, poached eggs if using, and some of the remaining gravy. Garnish with green onions and parsley.'

Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover, reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours, adding more water if needed to keep the beef submerged. Remove from the water and let cool 30 minutes, then cut into 1-inch-thick slices.Meanwhile, make the spice rub: Whisk the chile powder, paprika, oregano, coriander, mustard powder, cumin, chile de arbol and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Set aside.Make the sauce: Whisk the dijon and whole-grain mustards, the honey and horseradish in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Let the sauce sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.Spread the spice rub on a plate. Dredge one side of each slice of beef in the rub and tap off the excess. Heat a few tablespoons canola oil in a large nonstick saute pan until it begins to shimmer. A few slices at a time, add the beef, rub-side down, and cook until a golden-brown crust has formed, about 2 minutes. Flip the slices and continue cooking another minute or two, adding more oil as needed. Serve with cabbage and the sauce.Photograph by Ryan Liebe'

S"Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour two 9-inch-by-2-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Whisk together the milk, egg whites, vanilla seeds and vanilla extract in a medium bowl.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the 2 1/4 cups flour, the sugar, baking powder and salt. With the mixer running on low speed, add the 12 tablespoons butter, one piece at a time, and continue beating until the mixture resembles moist crumbs. Add all but 1/2 cup of the milk mixture and beat on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the remaining 1/2 cup milk mixture. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 30 seconds more. Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix for 20 seconds longer. Divide the batter evenly between the cake pans and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula.Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs attached, 22 to 24 minutes. Cool in the pans on a baking rack for 10 minutes. Run a small knife around the sides of the pans and invert the cakes onto the baking rack. Remove the parchment paper and let cool completely, about 45 minutes.Make the coconut filling: Combine the coconut custard and cream in a bowl and whip until soft peaks form.Make the coconut buttercream: Beat the butter and confectioners\\' sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the coconut custard and salt; beat until the buttercream is smooth.Assemble the cake: Use a long serrated knife to slice each cake horizontally into 2 layers. Reserve one of the flat bottom layers for the top of the cake. Place another one of the layers on a cardboard round, cut-side up, and brush with some of the coconut simple syrup. Spoon one-third of the coconut filling onto the cake, and using a small offset metal spatula, spread it into an even layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the cake. Repeat with 2 more layers. Brush the cut side of the reserved cake layer with the remaining syrup. Place the layer, cut-side down, on top of the cake. Frost the sides and the top of the cake with the buttercream. Pat the toasted coconut onto the sides of the cake and sprinkle some on the top.Photograph by Yunhee Kim"

Move the pork to the cooler part of the grill and continue grilling until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 150 degrees F, about 12 minutes longer. Remove the pork from the grill and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice into 1/4-inch thick slices.For the green sauce: Combine the cilantro, parsley, onions, lime juice, olive oil, salt, garlic and Scotch bonnet in a blender and blend until smooth.

S"For the French toast: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.Cut each slice of bread lengthwise into thirds (18 pieces total). Transfer to a baking rack set over a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes to dry out. Remove from the oven and let sit for another 30 minutes before making the French toast.Meanwhile, make the ganache: Whisk the heavy cream and almond butter together in a small saucepan, and bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring occasionallythe mixture doesn\\'t have to be completely smooth. Remove from the heat, cover, and let steep for 10 minutes.Put the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl. (If the cream has cooled off significantly, reheat it nearly to a simmer.) Strain the hot cream over the chocolate through a fine strainer, add the orange zest, and let sit for 1 minute. Whisk until smooth. Keep warm.Continue with the French toast: Whisk together the 1 cup sugar, cinnamon and star anise in a shallow baking dish.In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, 2 tablespoons sugar, half-and-half and vanilla extract until very smooth. Transfer to a second shallow baking dish.Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan later on, soak the bread until saturated, turning a few times, about 3 minutes total.In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat half of the oil and half of the butter until melted and shimmering. In batches, add the soaked bread and cook, turning, until golden brown on all sides, about 30 seconds per side. Immediately remove from the pan, toss in the spiced sugar, and transfer to a platter. Repeat with the remaining oil, butter and bread.Serve the churros warm with the ganache for dipping."

S'Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Add the onions and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ketchup and the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and simmer until thickened, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.*Transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth, season with salt and pepper, to taste. Pour into a bowl and allow to cool at room temperature. Sauce will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator stored in a tightly sealed container.For the Garlic Toast:Combine the butter and garlic in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the butter is melted. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove from the heat and let sit 5 minutes.Preheat the broiler.Put the bread on a baking sheet and broil until both sides until lightly golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Remove from the oven and brush them with the garlic butter. Transfer to a serving platter and set aside until ready to serve.For the Neat Joes:Heat the oil over high heat in a large high-sided saute pan until the oil begins to smoke. Add the beef, breaking it up into small pieces using a metal spatula or wooden spoon, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the pan.Add the onion and celery and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the poblano, bell peppers and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ancho powder and cook for 30 seconds. Add the BBQ sauce, 1/4 cup of water and the ketchup, bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, stir in the mustard, Worcestershire, honey, brown sugar and molasses. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the cover, return the meat to the pan and continue cooking until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes longer. Add the vinegar, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and stir in the 1/2 cup of parsley or cilantro.Top slices of the garlic bread with some of the sloppy joe mixture, sprinkle with cilantro or parsley.*When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.'

S"Make the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl.Melt the 12 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the cocoa powder and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the muscovado and granulated sugars and whisk until the sugar has dissolved. Add the coffee, buttermilk, eggs and vanilla extract and continue whisking until smooth and just combined. Add the dry ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth.Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 40 to 45 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the wire rack and let cool at least 1 hour before frosting.Make the frosting: Combine the whole milk, coconut milk and goat\\'s milk in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Keep warm while you prepare the caramel.Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan over high heat and cook without stirring until a deep amber color, 8 to 10 minutes. Slowly and carefully whisk in the warm milk mixture and continue whisking until smooth. Add the vanilla seeds and corn syrup. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the sauce is reduced by half and the consistency of a caramel sauce, about 55 minutes.Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, vanilla extract, salt and rum (if using). Transfer the sauce to a medium bowl and stir in the pecans and shredded coconut. Let the frosting cool to room temperature, stirring it occasionally, before frosting the cake.To assemble the cake, slice each cake in half horizontally. Place 1 cake layer on a cake round and spread one-third of the frosting evenly over the top. Repeat to make 3 layers, then top with the remaining cake layer, top-side up.Make the ganache: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan. Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl, add the hot cream and the corn syrup and let sit for 30 seconds. Gently whisk until smooth. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.Set the cake on a wire rack placed over a rimmed baking sheet. Pour the chocolate ganache over the cake, letting the excess drip down the sides. Sprinkle the top with toasted coconut and pecans. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours before slicing.Slice the cake and top with a dollop of Coconut Whipped Cream.Photograph by Yunhee Kim"

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pat the short ribs dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat the canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, brown the short ribs on both sides, about 8 minutes total. Remove to a plate.Meanwhile, combine the stock and dried chiles in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and let steep, 15 minutes.Discard all but 3 tablespoons oil from the Dutch oven. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes; add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Pour in the red wine and port and simmer, stirring, until almost completely reduced, about 12 minutes. Add the thyme and chile-stock mixture; bring to a simmer and return the short ribs to the pot. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook until the meat is tender, about 2 hours, 30 minutes.Remove the short ribs to a bowl; shred the meat from the bone. Strain the cooking liquid into a degreasing cup and pour off the excess fat. Pour the remaining liquid into a skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add the meat and toss to coat. Fill the taco shells with the meat; top with cilantro, queso sauce, pickled onions and chile relish.Queso Sauce:Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in 1 tablespoon flour; cook 1 minute. Slowly whisk in 1 1/4 cups warmed whole milk; cook, whisking, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 3 cups grated monterey jack and  1/4 cup grated parmesan; season with salt and pepper. Serve warm.Pickled Red Onions:Bring 3/4 cup lime juice, 1/4 cup each red wine vinegar and sugar, and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from the heat and let cool, 5 minutes. Toss with 1 thinly sliced red onion in a bowl; cover and chill at least 4 hours, stirring occasionally.Green Chile Relish:Broil 2 poblano peppers until charred on all sides; transfer to a bowl, cover and set aside, 10 minutes. Peel, seed and dice. Combine with 4 diced jarred piquillo peppers, 1 tablespoon honey, 2 tablespoons canola oil, the juice of 1 lime, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, and salt and pepper in a bowl; let sit at least 15 minutes before serving.Photograph by Andrew MCcaul'

S'Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Season chicken pieces on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a few tablespoons of clarified butter in a Dutch oven over high heat. Place chicken in skin side down and cook until golden brown. Turn the chicken over and brown the other side. Remove chicken to a baking sheet and bake in the oven until just cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and saute until golden brown. Add the shallots and cook for 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and add the Cognac and cook until completely reduced. Add the wine and cook until completely reduced. Add the stock and tomato and bring to a simmer. Cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon ("nappe") and then swirl in the butter ("monter au beurre"). Once the butter is added, the sauce can not be further reduced because it will break. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the tarragon and chervil. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Remove the breastbone from the breast. Cut each breast into 2 even pieces on the bias. Cut the legs into 2 pieces at the joint and on the bias and remove the thighbones. Serve 1 leg piece and 1 breast piece. Make sure only 1 piece contains a bone. Serve on hot plates, napped with the sauce.'

S'Special equipment: a 3-inch biscuit cutterFor the roasted tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Spread the tomatoes out on the prepared baking sheet. Smash the garlic cloves with your knife blade; mince, sprinkle with some salt, and then smear to a paste using flat side of the knife. Whisk together the oil, herbs and garlic; drizzle over the tomatoes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast the tomatoes until soft and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Set aside.For the scones: Adjust the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper in a large bowl. In a second bowl, whisk together the 3 eggs, cream and hot sauce until combined.Cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add the wet ingredients and the cheese and ham to the dry ingredients; mix until a dough just comes together--the dough should be wet.Transfer the dough to a generously floured work surface and pat out to a 1-inch thickness.  Cut into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit cutter; transfer the rounds to the prepared baking sheet, spaced a few inches apart. Re-roll the scraps and cut more scones. Beat the remaining 1 egg with a touch of heavy cream; brush the scones with the egg wash.Bake the scones until golden brown on top and bottom, about 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a baking rack to cool completely.To assemble the McScones: Slice the scones in half horizontally. Put 2 or 3 roasted tomato slices on the bottom halves.Heat the butter and oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Fry the eggs, in batches if needed, until the whites are set and the yolks still runny, about 2 to 3 minutes; season with a little salt and pepper just before done. Using the biscuit cutter, cut the eggs around the yolks to make rounds that fit the scones.Set the eggs on the scones, atop the tomato slices; add a bit of watercress, and finish up with the top half of each scone. Serve immediately.'

S"For the banana bread: Put a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.  Spray a 9-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.Put the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until the butter turns a deep golden brown. Remove and let cool slightly.Sift the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon into a small bowl. Mash the bananas in a medium bowl, and then whisk in the granulated and brown sugars, egg and cooled brown butter. Add the flour mixture and whisk until just combined; don\\'t over-mix.Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake on the lower rack of the oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Let cool on a baking rack in the pan for 15 minutes. Remove from the pan and let cool completely on the rack.  Once completely cool, wrap and keep overnight.For the bananas Foster sauce: Melt the butter in a skillet over high heat. Stir in the muscovado sugar and cook, stirring, until melted. Stir in the rum and cook, stirring, until the rum is almost completely evaporated. Whisk in the cream and cook until just heated through. Add the bananas and cook for 1 minute longer. Keep warm while you make the waffles.For the waffles: Heat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Spray with nonstick spray. Slice the banana bread about 1 inch thick, lay the slices on the waffles grates (you may be able to fit just 3 in comfortably), close the cover and cook, pressing if necessary to squeeze the bread, until golden brown and slightly crisped, 40 seconds to 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining banana bread slices. Serve with some of the bananas Foster sauce spooned over the top."

S'Put the orange juice, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and red pepper flakes in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 15 minutes. Keep about 1/2 cup warm for serving and set aside the rest for glazing.Preheat the grill to high heat. Brush the chicken with oil on both sides and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill smooth-side down, covered, until lightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and brush generously with the glaze. Cook, covered, until charred and the thighs are just cooked through, another 3 to 4 minutes. Flip again, glaze, and cook uncovered about 1 minute. Remove the chicken to a cutting board, sprinkle with the chives if using, and rest the chicken for a few minutes.Slice the chicken into thin strips. Serve with butter lettuce leaves for wraps and the reserved glaze on the side.'

S'Whisk together the soy, vinegar, honey, chili paste, ginger and garlic in a bowl and divide the mixture in half.  Add 1 half to a large baking dish, then add the chicken, turning to coat.  Cover and let the meat marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours.  Add the green onions, sesame oil, black pepper and sesame seeds to the remaining half of the mixture. Reserve it as a dipping sauce for the finished chicken. Light a grill, making sure to include a zone of indirect heat.Remove the chicken from the marinade and put it over the charcoal, skin side down. Grill until the skin is golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Relocate the chicken to the indirect heat zone, lower the cover and grill until cooked through.  Remove the chicken from the grill to a cutting board and carve.  Arrange the chicken on a serving platter and serve wrapped in tortillas, if desired, with dipping sauce on the side.'

S'For the relish: Put the garlic, pine nuts, serrano and some salt in a mortar and pestle and mash to a chunky, pesto-like consistency. Add the cilantro and continue to mash; the pesto should be very coarse.Put the avocados and lime juice in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Gently fold in the pesto until just combined, being careful not to mash the avocado too much.For the crema: Heat a grill to high. Toss the tomato halves with some canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until the tomatoes are charred and softened, turning once or twice, about 5 minutes total.Combine the grilled tomatoes, vinegar and chipotles in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Add the garlic, onions, cilantro, oregano and some salt and pepper and pulse until slightly smooth.Put the yogurt in a medium bowl and swirl in some of the salsa, being careful not to stir it in completely.For the slaw: Put the lemon juice, orange juice, honey, mustard, basil and some salt and pepper in a blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running, drizzle in the canola oil until emulsified.Combine the Napa cabbage, red cabbage and carrot in a large bowl; add half of the dressing and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper; add more dressing if needed, reserving a little for fish.For the rub: Combine the ancho powder, cinnamon, cumin, salt, brown sugar and black pepper in a bowl. Mix to blend.For the fish: Brush the top of the fish filets with canola oil, and sprinkle them with salt, pepper and about 3 tablespoons of the spice rub. Let stand for 5 minutes, then grill the filets, spice-side down, over direct heat until the fish is lightly charred and comes away from the grill easily, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook another 2 minutes to sear on the reverse side. Move the fish over indirect heat, cover the grill, and cook until the fish is just cooked through, another 3 to 4 minutes; the fish should be just firm when squeezed lightly on the sides. Remove the fish to a platter and let rest for a few minutes.While the fish rests, grill the tortillas over direct heat until slightly charred and just warm, about 5 seconds per side. With a fork, flake the fish into large chunks. Drizzle with the remaining slaw dressing and top with cilantro leaves.Serve the fish family-style with the tortillas and butter lettuce (for wrapping), and the avocado relish, tomato crema, and cabbage slaw in bowls on the side.'

S'In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, bring the water, corn syrup, 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar and vanilla bean to 246 degrees F. Before adding the syrup to the egg whites below, carefully remove the vanilla bean.In the meantime, in a completely clean, dry mixing bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, salt and cream of tartar until creamy and foamy, about 2 minutes. Still whisking, sprinkle in the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and continue to whisk until the whites hold very soft peaks, about 2 minutes. While mixing on slow speed, carefully drizzle in the hot syrup. Turn the mixer to high and whisk until thick, fluffy and just warm, about 7 minutes. Turn the mixer to low and whisk in the reserved vanilla seeds. Scrape the fluff into a bowl.  Wash the bowl and whisk and return them to the machine.Combine the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of the mixer and mix until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low until combined.  Increase the speed and whip until light and fluffy.  Add about 2 cups of Fluff and the vanilla and whip until combined.  Refrigerate for 15 minutes if too soft to use as frosting.'

Place the chicken in the bucket, breast-side down, cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.Remove the chicken from the brine and rinse well with cold water. Pat dry, place on a baking rack and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. This will allow the skin to dry out which will produce a crisper skin while cooking.Preheat your smoker to 275 degrees F and up to 325 degrees F if your smoker can do it. Add the soaked wood chips and rosemary sprigs.Brush the entire chicken with canola oil and sprinkle with pepper. Put the chicken in the smoker and place a drip pan underneath. Smoke until the breast temperature reaches 160 degrees F and the thigh reaches 170 degrees F, depending on the size of the chicken, 1 1/2 to 3 hours.'

S'In a medium saucepan add blueberries, maple syrup, sugar, cinnamon stick, and lemon zest. Bring to a simmer over low heat, and cook for about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and chill overnight. Strain; serve warm or at room temperature.  For the compote:Combine blueberries, sugar, butter, cinnamon stick and vanilla bean in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and stir in the cassis. Discard the vanilla bean and cinnamon stick. Serve at room temperature, folding in the chopped mint just before serving.For the pancakes:Mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl and set aside. In a separate bowl, combine the egg yolks, oil, buttermilk, lemon zest and vanilla extract. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the liquid mixture. Mix together until flour is just incorporated. In a small bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the batter just until incorporated. Let sit for 15 minutes, then gently fold in the blueberries. In a small bowl mix the ricotta and milk. Reserve for garnish.Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.Heat a nonstick pan or cast iron griddle over medium heat. Add a pat of butter and heat until the butter just begins to sizzle. Scoop a scant 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan or onto the griddle and cook until bubbles appear on the top surface and the bottom is golden brown, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Flip over and cook until the bottom is lightly golden brown, about 45 seconds. Remove to a baking sheet and keep warm in a low oven. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve with syrup and compote and garnish with a dollop of ricotta.'

S"Set rack in the middle of oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Line a 12 slot muffin pan with large paper or foil cupcake liners.Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt together 3 times. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together at high speed for 15 seconds until combined. Add the eggs 1 at a time beating until each is incorporated. Continue beating until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes longer. With the mixer at its lowest speed, beat in 1/3 the flour mixture. Beat in the buttermilk and vanilla, then another third of the flour. Beat in the coffee and then the remaining flour. Fill the sections of the muffin tin 1/2 full and bake for 15 minutes or until the centers spring back when lightly pressed. Set pan on a rack to cool.Peanut Butter Buttercream Filling: Beat the butter and peanut butter at medium speed in a mixing bowl until blended. Reduce speed to low and gradually beat in the confectioners\\' sugar. Increase speed to high and beat for 3 to 5 minutes until smooth and fluffy. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium, plain tip with filling. Insert tip into each cooled cupcake and squeeze approximately 3 tablespoons of filling into each cupcake.Ganache Frosting: Place chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring the cream to a scald in a small saucepan. Pour cream over chocolate and let sit 1 minute, then whisk until smooth. Let sit for 10 minutes until thick, but still pourable. Dunk the top half of the cupcakes into the frosting to coat, then place on a rack and sprinkle with the chopped peanuts. Transfer to the refrigerator for 20 minutes to set."

S'Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, chipotle, honey and oil; season with salt and pepper. Place sushi mat on a work surface with slats running crosswise. Arrange 1 sheet nori, shiny side down, on mat, lining up a long edge of sheet with edge of mat nearest you. Using damp fingers, gently press 1/4 of rice onto nori in 1 layer, leaving a 1 3/4-inch border on side farthest from you. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Flip the nori and rice over so that the nori is now the top layer. Make a thin line of cucumber along the nori 1 to 2 inches from the edge closest to you. Drizzle some of the spicy mayonnaise mixture over the cucumbers, then spoon on the tuna and sprinkle with cilantro and scallions. Roll tightly, using the sushi mat to guide you. Slice about 1/1/2 inches thick. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make a total of 4 rolls.'

Melt 1/4 cup butter and whisk into yeast with vanilla and egg yolk.Whisk the flour, 1/4 cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in yeast mixture to make a sticky dough. Knead the dough on a floured work surface until soft and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. (Dough will be soft and elastic, but not terribly sticky.) Shape into a ball, brush with a little melted butter and put into a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.Knead the dough and reform into a ball. Return to the bowl, cover with buttered plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours.For the filling:Roll the dough into 10 by 18-inch rectangle with a long edge facing you. Spread soft butter over the surface. Whisk 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon together, scatter over butter. Roll into a long tight cylinder; pinch long edge to seal. Cut into 1 1/2-inch rolls with string or dental floss. Evenly space the rolls in the pan.

If using cast iron pan, place the burger in the pan and cook until slightly charred and the spices have formed a crust, about 1 1/2 minutes (be careful not to burn the spices.)  Turn the burger over, lower the heat to medium and continue cooking to desired doneness. If using a grill, grill the burgers on the grates of the grill for about same amount of time. Top each burger with 2 slices of cheese during the last 30 seconds of cooking, until cheese is melted.Put the burgers on the buns, top with the ham, some of the onions and some of the mayonnaise sauce and potato chips.

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Using a serrated knife, slice about 1 inch off the top crust of the Italian bread. Carefully tear out the insides of the loaf, leaving about 3/4-inch of bread to form a shell. Put the loaf on the prepared baking sheet, drizzle inside with some olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Bake until slightly crispy, about 10 minutes. Cool on a baking rack while you make the eggs. Preheat the broiler.Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until golden brown. Remove the sausage to a paper-towel-lined plate.Add the onion and the green and red peppers to the skillet; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Reduce the heat slightly, then add the chiles, sausage, parsley and basil; toss to combine. Stir in the eggs and about two-thirds of the provolone and cook, stirring, until the eggs just begin to set, less than 1 minute.Pour the egg mixture into the bread shell and top with the Parmesan and the remaining provolone. Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the eggs are just cooked through, about 3 minutes. (You can use a cake tester to check--insert it into the eggs to see if it comes out with raw egg on it.)Transfer to a cutting board, let set for 1 or 2 minutes, and then slice into 4 to 6 wedges.'

S'For the lamb: Soak the currants in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain.Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a 6-quart saucepan over high heat. Add the lamb, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cayenne, and salt and pepper and cook, stirring to break up the meat, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer the lamb to a large strainer set over a bowl and drain; discard any liquid left in the pan. Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the onions and bell pepper and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the serrano and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.Return the lamb to the pan, add the wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and currants and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in the parsley and oregano and season with salt and pepper and honey, if needed. Remove from the heat.For the eggplant: Heat the canola oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Season the eggplant slices on both sides with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add the eggplant slices and fry until tender and lightly golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer the eggplant slices to paper towels.For the bechamel: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until pale and smooth, 2 minutes. Still whisking constantly, add the milk and bay leaf and cook until thickened. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg and discard the bay leaf. Let the sauce cool for 5 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, goat cheese, and lemon zest and whisk into the bechamel sauce until smooth.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a 3-quart baking dish or casserole dish.To assemble: Put half the eggplant slices in the dish and cover with half the meat sauce. Top the sauce with the remaining eggplant slices, and then the remaining meat sauce. Pour the bechamel over the top of the meat sauce and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle Romano evenly over the top, place the dish on a baking sheet, and bake until browned and bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes. Top with more chopped parsley, if desired. Let cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.'

Set a cast-iron skillet large enough to hold both steaks on one side of the grill. Brush the steaks with canola oil and season very liberally with salt and pepper. Grill until well-charred on the first side, 2 to 3 minutes; flip and grill until well-charred on the second side, another 2 to 3 minutes. (The steaks should still be raw at the center at this point.) Transfer to a cutting board.Slice the steaks across the grain about 1 1/2-inches thick; dont separate the slices. Keeping the steak slices together, transfer the steaks to the skillet and top with the butter. Cover the grill and cook the steaks for 5 minutes for medium rare. Transfer the skillet to a trivet.Arrange the steak slices on a platter so that the interior of the slices is facing up. Top each slice with some blue cheese. Pour the hot brown butter from the skillet over the steak. Serve immediately.'

S'For the butter: Combine pecans and brown sugar in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Add the bourbon, if using, vanilla, butter, vanilla seeds and salt and pulse again until smooth. Scrape into a large ramekin. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Let soften again before using.For the banana bread: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place an oven rack in the middle. Liberally spray the bottom and sides of a 9- by 5- by 3-inch light metal loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.Mix together the flour, sugars, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Mix together the butter, oil, vanilla, bananas and eggs in  another bowl. Lightly fold the wet ingredients (banana mixture) into the dry ingredients using a rubber spatula until just combined. The batter should be thick and chunky (do not over-mix; the batter should not be smooth). If you over-mix, the bread will become rubbery!Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let the bread cool  in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes, and then remove the it from the pan. Serve slices warm slathered with the vanilla pecan butter.'

S'Two days before cooking: Combine the Spanish paprika, New Mexican chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, thyme, chile de arbol and cayenne in a small bowl. Remove 1/4 cup for another use, such as the Eggplant Casserole with Red Pepper Pesto and Cajun Breadcrumbs.Dissolve the salt and sugar in 2 gallons cold water in a large (at least 16-quart) stockpot or a clean bucket. Whisk in half of the remaining spice rub, the garlic, bay leaves and onion. Add the turkey, cover and refrigerate or set in a very cold place (that stays somewhere between 32 to 40 degrees F) for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours. Rinse well under cold water and pat dry to remove the salt. Let air-dry in the refrigerator for 24 hours.In The Big Green Egg: Light a large chimney filled with charcoal briquettes (about 5 quarts) and allow to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a layer of fine gray ash. Empty the coals into the grill. Top with some of the soaked wood chips if using. Put in the ceramic plate, then the grill rack. Put the cover on and let the grate heat up.Brush the turkey with oil and rub the entire turkey (including the cavity) with the remaining spice rub. Tie the legs together. Adjust the grill vents to get and maintain an internal temperature of 350 degrees F. Roast the turkey for 2 hours to 2 hours and 15 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh reads 165 degrees F. Remove from the grill, tent with foil and let rest for 30 minutes before carving.In the Caja China: Prepare the charcoal briquettes according to the instructions that come with the box. Put the roasting pan with its rack (comes with the box) inside, and put the turkey breast-side down on the rack. Put on the top and fill with charcoal. After 30 minutes, flip the turkey breast-side up and continue cooking for about 1 more hour, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh reads 165 degrees F. Add charcoal as necessary according to the box instructions. Remove from the box, tent with foil and let rest for 30 minutes before carving.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season the shanks on both sides with salt and pepper, place in the pan and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the shanks to a plate. Remove fat from the pan. Add the pancetta to the pan and cook until golden brown. Remove pancetta with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic to the pan and cook until soft and lightly golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.Add the red wine, scrape the bottom of the pan and cook until completely reduced. Add the beef stock, diced tomatoes, thyme, rosemary and parsley and bring to a simmer. Add the shanks and 1/3 of the pancetta back to the pan, cover and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is tender and falling off the bone, about 2 hours. Remove the shanks to a cutting board and when cool enough to handle, shred the meat into bite-size pieces and place in a bowl. Strain the cooking liquid into a bowl. Place 3 cups of the cooking liquid into a large high-sided saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced to about 3/4 cup. Add the shredded meat and the remaining cooked pancetta to the pan along with 1 cup of the tomato sauce, parsley and basil and stir to combine and just heat through.For the Ricotta Mixture:Stir together the ricotta, eggs, parsley, basil, cheese and salt and pepper in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to meld.For the Tomato Sauce:Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add the onions and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red chili flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, bring to boil, season with salt and pepper and cook until the sauce is reduced and thickened, about 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in the parsley and basil.For the Bechamel (Mornay) Sace:Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and let cook for about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in 2 cups of the hot milk and continue whisking until the sauce is thickened and loses its raw flavor, about 5 to 7 minutes. Season the sauce with nutmeg, salt and pepper and whisk in the cheeses. If the sauce is too thick, whisk in some of the remaining milk.For Assembly:Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with the butter. Ladle a thin layer of bechamel evenly over the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of pasta dough, cut to fit the inside of the pan on top of the bechamel and top the pasta with the ricotta mixture and spread evenly. Spread a thin layer of bechamel over the ricotta, sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan and some basil leaves. Top with another layer of pasta and spread the meat mixture evenly over the top. Ladle an even layer of bechamel over the Bolognese mixture, sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan and some basil leaves. Place the final layer of pasta dough over the meat mixture and ladle the bechamel over the top to completely cover the pasta and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of Parmesan.Place the pan on a baking sheet and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F, remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 25 to 35 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and let rest 10 minutes before cutting. Cut into slices and top with some of the tomato sauce, more grated cheese and chopped parsley and basil.'

S"Make the waffle batter: Whisk together the buttermilk, eggs and honey in a small bowl.  Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, cumin, fine sea salt and cayenne in a large bowl.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, add the wet ingredients and gently whisk together until just combined (do not over mix).  Fold in the butter, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the batter for 30 minutes.While the waffle batter rests, make the red chile sauce: Put the garlic on a cutting board, sprinkle with kosher salt, and use the flat side of your knife blade to smear the garlic and salt to a coarse paste. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and their juices, the ancho and pasilla chile powders and some salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash the tomatos and cook slightly thickened, about 10 minutes longer. Mash again to make a chunky sauce. Stir in the chipotle puree, honey, vinegar and salt and pepper to taste, cook another 1 to 2 minutes then remove from the heat.Make the crema: Combine the cilantro, garlic, cotija and pine nuts in a small food processor and puree the mixture until it is smooth. Whisk together the crema and goat cheese in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in the cilantro mixture and lime zest and set aside. Season with salt and pepper.Make the waffles: Heat the waffle iron according to manufacturer\\'s instructions. Spray with nonstick pan spray, then ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter into each grid, close, and cook until golden brown on both sides and steam stops coming out from the iron, about 4 minutes. Transfer the waffles to a baking sheet.Make the eggs: Preheat the broiler to high. Crack 4 eggs into each of 2 small bowls. Heat 2 medium nonstick skillets over medium-high heat (or use 1 skillet and cook the eggs in 2 batches). Add 2 tablespoons butter to each skillet; once the bubbles mostly subside, slip 4 eggs into each skillet and season the tops with salt and pepper. When the whites start to set, after 1 to 2 minutes, cover the skillet and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes longer.While the eggs cook, assemble the waffles: Combine the Cheddar and Moneterey Jack cheeses in a medium bowl, then top each waffle with about 1/2 cup of cheese and broil until the cheese is bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes. Top each waffle with a fried egg, a generous amount of chile sauce and a dollop of crema. Garnish with scallions and cilantro leaves and serve immediately."

S'Preheat grill to medium. If using hardwood or other charcoal, move over to 1 side of grill; if using gas, leave 1 section off.Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper, and drizzle well with canola oil. Place on the grill skin side down over direct heat, cooking until golden brown and slightly charred. Open and close the grill, as necessary, to maintain the heat without letting the skin burn. When skin is nicely charred and blistered, flip over and move to indirect heat, close lid and continue cooking until just cooked through, about 17 minutes longer, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken registers 155 degrees F. Remove from the grill and let rest 10 minutes before cutting.While the chicken is cooking, brush tomatoes, lemons and onion slices with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill lemons cut side down until golden brown, and tomatoes cut side down until slightly charred. Grill onion slices, flipping once, until softened and slightly charred.Make the vinaigrette by whisking the vinegar and mustard until smooth. Slowly whisk in the olive oil, then whisk in the oregano and season with salt and pepper.To serve, carve the chicken into 6 to 8 serving pieces and arrange in a large shallow serving bowl. Arrange the tomatoes and onions, all but 1 of the lemon halves, and the cucumbers over and around the chicken. Scatter the olives and feta cheese over, then drizzle with vinaigrette. Tear the basil leaves over the dish, and then dollop the yogurt in the center.'

S"Special equipment: a pastry bag; a small piping tip, such as the Ateco 0Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Set a baking rack on a baking sheet and put it in the oven.For the glaze: Put the cream cheese in a bowl. Heat the maple syrup in a small saucepan over low heat until it just begins to simmer, then pour over the cream cheese and whisk vigorously until smooth. Set aside and keep warm.For the cinnamon swirl: Melt the butter in a small saucepan until light golden brown. Whisk in the muscovado sugar and cinnamon; the sugar may clump and separate from the butterdon\\'t worry. Whisk in 1/4 cup water and bring to a simmer, whisking until the mixture smoothes out. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cream and simmer another 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl to cool--the mixture will thicken as it cools--then transfer to a piping bag with a small tip.For the pancakes: Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, 3 tablespoons melted butter, eggs and vanilla. Add the wet mixture to the dry and whisk until just combined.Heat a large nonstick pan or cast-iron griddle over medium heat and brush with some melted butter. Ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan and spread to make a 4-inch circle. Ladle in a few more pancakes, being careful not to crowd them.When the pancakes just begin to form bubbles on the surface, pipe in the cinnamon swirl filling: Starting at the center of the pancakes, squeeze the filling on top in a swirl (just as you see in a regular cinnamon bun). Continue cooking until larger bubbles begin to appear, the surfaces are somewhat dry and set, and the bottoms are light golden brown, about 2 minutes--adjust the heat as necessary so the bottoms don\\'t brown before the tops set. Flip over and continue cooking until golden brown on the reverse side, about 1 minute longer.Transfer the pancakes to the oven to keep warm while you make the rest of the pancakes.To serve: Stack 3 pancakes on each plate, drizzle with some of the maple cream cheese glaze, and sprinkle with pecans."

Rub the cut part with lemon and put the apples into a 9-inch square baking dish. Dice the carved-out parts of the apples, without the seeds, and set aside.Melt the butter in a small saucepan, and then whisk in 4 tablespoons of the muscovado sugar, the cinnamon and pepper and cook until smooth. Brush the inside of the apples with the butter mixture. Pour the apple cider into the bottom of the baking dish. Cover the dish with foil and bake until the apples are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 5 minutes longer.Transfer the apples to a platter. Carefully strain the cooking liquid into a small saucepan and bring it to a boil. Cook until it is reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes.While the apples are baking, stir the hot milk, remaining muscovado sugar, reserved chopped apples and orange zest into the warm oatmeal and cook for a few minutes. Divide the oatmeal among the baked apples. Top each apple with a dollop of yogurt and drizzle the reduced cider over the top.'

Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release 1 corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.

S'For the garlic chips: Add the oil to a small saute pan to fill 1/4 inch up the sides and heat over medium-high heat. Once heated, add 1 garlic slice to test; if it sizzles when added, then add the remaining garlic. Fry until golden brown. Remove the chips from the oil and place on a paper-towel-lined plate. Season with salt. Make sure not to step away, constantly stir and be ready to remove once golden brown.For the polenta: To a medium saucepan over high heat, add the oil and shallots and sweat the shallots, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the warmed stock to the pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the polenta in a fine stream, whisking constantly with a wire whisk. Once all the polenta has been added, reduce the heat to low. Stir, using a wooden spoon, every 5 minutes and continue cooking until all the liquid has been absorbed and the mixture is very creamy, 10 to 15 minutes.Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese and heavy cream until combined. Stir in the creme fraiche. Taste and season with salt and pepper.For the lobster sauce: To a saute pan over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter and melt. Add the lobster and toss to combine. Add the garlic paste and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Deglaze with the white wine and reduce. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and swirl to combine. Remove from the heat and add the parsley, tarragon and lemon zest.To serve: Add some of the polenta to a plate. Top with some of the sauteed lobster and sauce. Garnish with garlic chips, chervil and freshly ground black pepper.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.For the pork tenderloin: To a bowl, add the paprika, brown sugar, coriander, cumin, mustard powder, chili powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper, and stir to combine.Heat 2 tablespoons of the canola oil in a cast-iron pan over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Sprinkle the tenderloin on both sides with the seasoning mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the pork in the pan and sear on all sides until golden brown, about 8 minutes.Transfer the pork to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Put the pan into the oven and roast the pork to medium (an internal temperature of 130 degrees F), about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, tent loosely with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2-inch-thick medallions.For the pomegranate sauce: Whisk together the pomegranate molasses, vinegar, mustard and honey in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil until emulsified.For the pesto: Combine the cilantro, cheese, pine nuts, jalapenoes, garlic, and some salt and pepper in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and process until emulsified. Scrape into a bowl.For the brussels sprouts: Put the brussels sprouts on a baking sheet , toss with the canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until light golden brown and a knife inserted into the centers goes in without any resistance, 20 to 30 minutes.When ready to serve, reheat the brussels sprouts in a saute pan with the butter. Then add the pomegranate molasses.Plating: Place 2 pork medallions cut-side up on a plate. Top with some pomegranate sauce across the pork and a dollop of jalapeno pesto on the top of each pork medallion.

S"To make the matzo balls, bring a large pot of salted water or chicken broth to a boil over high heat. Whisk the eggs, oils, chicken fat, water, parsley, salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, add the matzo meal and sift in the baking powder. Mix together, then fold into the eggs. Cover with plastic wrap, pressed tightly against the batter and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight. Moisten your hands lightly with water and form the matzo mixture into 24 walnut-sized balls. Carefully drop the matzo balls into the water or broth. Reduce the heat to medium and partially cover. Simmer gently until the matzo balls are cooked through, about 40 minutes. Using a skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer the matzo balls to a large bowl of cold water. Meanwhile, make the soup. Bring the chicken pieces and stock to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat, skimming off the foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer, partially covered, until the chicken is tender, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the chicken from the soup. Remove and discard the skin, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces, and reserve the meat until service. Return the remaining bones back to the broth and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes more to further develop the soup\\'s flavor.While the soup is simmering, heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, tomatoes, red and green peppers, cilantro, garlic and saffron. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables in the sofrito are tender, but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add the hot sauce, if using. Set the sofrito aside. When ready to serve, strain the soup and discard the bones. Return the soup to the pot and stir in the sofrito and chicken pieces. Add the matzo balls and simmer until the matzo balls are heated through, about 5 minutes. (The soup and matzo balls can be prepared up to 2 days ahead, cooled, covered, and refrigerated. Reheat before serving.)Ladle the soup, along with sofrito, chicken and matzo balls into bowls and serve hot, with an optional drizzle of the additional melted chicken fat (schmaltz)."

S"Flour your work surface lightly and roll the dough, or pieces of it, about 1/8-inch thick (too thin and the dough will tear as you fill the dumplings). Cut out circles with a 3-inch round cutter. Cover the dough with a side towel or piece of plastic wrap as you work.Have a small bowl of water next to you. Place a scant tablespoon of filling in the middle of a dough circle, and press it so that it spreads slightly toward the side edges of the dough. Using your fingertip or a small pastry brush, wet the edge of the dough. Fold the dough up around the filling so that the filling sits on the work surface-that\\'s the bottom of your dumpling-and the seam is between your fingers. Pleat the dough that is facing you, about 6 times, pressing it against the back to seal-only the front of the dumpling should be pleated. The corners of the dumpling should curl slightly away from you, toward the unpleated side.Heat a skillet, just large enough to accommodate the number of dumplings you want to cook over high heat. Add a thin coating of oil, heat, then add the dumplings in concentric circles. They should be touching. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes (reduce the heat if they are browning too quickly). Add enough water to come about 1/4 of the way up the sides of the dumplings-it will spatter. Cover the skillet, adjust the heat so that the water is simmering, and cook for about 7 minutes. Uncover the skillet and, if there is water left, let it cook off. Check the dumpling bottoms-if they need to brown a bit more, let them, adding a bit more oil if necessary.Serve the dumplings immediately, drizzled with some dipping sauce and garnished with cilantro and lime wedges."

S'Brine the chicken: Combine 2 quarts water, the salt and sugar in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until the salt and sugar dissolve, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the garlic, thyme, cinnamon, allspice, peppercorns and Scotch bonnet. Let the brine cool completely.Add the chicken wings to the brine, cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours.Remove the wings from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Put the wings on a baking rack set over a baking sheet and put in the refrigerator to dry, at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.Meanwhile, soak 2 cups pimento or apple wood chips in water at least 30 minutes.Make the glaze: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Pour in the orange juice and 1/2 cup water and bring to a simmer. Add the tamarind, ketchup and honey and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, whisk in the vinegar and Sriracha, and season with salt and pepper. Let cool slightly.Heat your grill to medium for indirect grilling.Add the drained wood chips to the coals in a charcoal grill or put them in the smoker box of a gas grill. Close the grill cover and let smoke build, 10 minutes.Add the wings to the grill directly over the heat source, close the lid and grill until golden brown on both sides, 10 to 15 minutes per side. Transfer to the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat), cover the grill and continue cooking until the wings are cooked through, about 15 minutes.Put the wings in a large bowl. Add the honey-tamarind glaze and toss to coat. Season with salt, transfer to plates and garnish with scallions.Photograph by Jennifer Causey'

S'For the brine: Bring 4 cups water, the salt, peppercorns, garlic and chiles to a boil. Stir until the salt is dissolved. Remove the brine from the heat and cool slightly. Stir in the ice cubes. The brine should be cold when you add the chicken. Add the chicken, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.Meanwhile, for the lemony fennel slaw: Whisk the mayonnaise, lemon zest, lemon juice and sugar in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, fennel, fronds and parsley in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Remove the chicken from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Place the chicken skin-side up on a baking rack set over a baking sheet. Refrigerate the chicken for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. This will allow the chicken skin to dry out and produce a crisper crust on the grill.Meanwhile, for the chile oil: Combine the oil, peppercorns, chiles, garlic, oregano and salt in a small saucepan over low heat and simmer. Remove the saucepan from the heat and keep at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. Transfer the oil to a blender and blend until smooth. Drain the oil into a bowl.Heat the grill for direct medium heat and indirect grilling. If using charcoal, make sure the bottom vents and top vents of the grill are open.Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Brush the chicken with 3 tablespoons of the chile oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the chicken skin-side down over the coals, on direct heat. Grill the chicken until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes. Flip the chicken and move it over the indirect heat. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 160 degrees F, about 30 minutes. Add coals as necessary to maintain the grill temperature at about 400 degrees F.Transfer the chicken to a cutting board; wait 10 minutes before carving. Carve the chicken and drizzle with the remaining chile oil. Garnish the chicken with grilled lemon halves and parsley leaves. Serve with the lemony fennel slaw on the side.'

S'Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Cut the steak into 4 equal portions.Place the buttermilk in a medium baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Combine the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne and 2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in a bowl and divide between 2 baking dishes.Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off. Dredge in the second dish of flour and pat off the excess. Put the steak pieces on a baking rack set over a baking sheet while the oil heats.Place 1-inch of oil in a large cast iron skillet until it reaches 350 degrees F on a thermometer. Add the steak, 2 pieces at a time and cook until golden brown on both sides. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels and season with salt. Repeat with the remaining meat. Transfer the meat to a rack set on a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm while you make the gravy.Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan, leaving the crunchy pieces from the breading. Add the bacon and cook until golden brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.Return the pan to the stove over medium heat. Whisk the flour into the pan and let cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the warm milk and continue to cook, whisking occasionally until thickened. Stir in the heavy cream and thyme and season with salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Serve 1 piece per person ladled with some of the sauce and garnished with a few pieces of bacon. Garnish with thyme sprigs.'

The sauce can be prepared 1 day in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator.Makes 1/2 cupToasted Burger BunsI think the taste and the texture of buns are best when lightly toasted. To toast a bun on a grill, grill pan, or griddle, split the bun open, place it cut side down on the grill, and grill until light golden brown, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, you can place the split bun halves cut side up on a baking sheet and cook them under a preheated broiler until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Keep a close eye on them and don\\'t let them get too brown or else that texture will take on a life of its own and defeat the purpose of starting with a soft bun."

S"Special equipment: One 12-cup or two 6-cup doughnut pans, preferably nonstick; a pastry bagFor the doughnuts: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup doughnut pan with nonstick spray.Put the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Transfer the brown butter to a measuring cup and set aside.Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar and eggs until smooth; then whisk in the buttermilk and vanilla until combined. Add the flour mixture and half of the brown butter (1/4 cup) to the egg mixture; mix until just combined -- DO NOT OVERMIX.Transfer the batter to a pastry bag and fill the doughnut pan about three-quarters full.  Bake the doughnuts until light golden brown and just baked through, about 8 minutes; (They will be darker on the bottom, where the batter cooks against the pan, than on the top.) Set the pan on a baking rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Remove the doughnuts from the pan and place them directly on the baking rack. Set the rack over some parchment or foil before glazing.For the glaze: Bring the maple syrup and the remaining half of the brown butter (1/4 cup) to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the bourbon, cook for 1 minute, and then remove from the heat and whisk in the confectioners\\' sugar until smooth and slightly thick. Transfer the glaze to a shallow medium bowl and leave to thicken slightly. Drizzle the glaze over the doughnuts, sprinkle the pecans on top, and serve."

Add in the oil, vinegar, honey and paprika, and salt and pepper, to taste. Continue pulsing to make a soupy vinaigrette (it will look a bit creamy until it settles), pouring in more oil and/or vinegar if too thick. Transfer the chimichurri to a glass bowl and fold in the diced mango. Set aside.For the rib eye steak: Brush the steak with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Grill until golden brown and slightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the steaks and continue grilling 5 to 6 minutes longer. Remove from the grill and let rest 5 minutes.Top each steak with a large dollop of the Mango Chimichurri and serve."

Bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover, and simmer until just soft throughout but not quite cooked, approximately 50 to 80 minutes, depending on the beans. Drain and set aside. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven. Add onion and cook until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and their liquid, 2 cups water, honey, cloves, salt, and pepper and boil gently for 20 to 30 minutes or until it begins to thicken. Stir in the parsley and remove from heat. Place the beans in an oven-proof dish, pour tomato mixture on top, stir and spread mixture out evenly. Bake 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until beans are soft. (Check the dish during cooking and if needed, add a small amount of boiling water.) The dish will look crispy on top. Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Place the bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and espresso powder in a medium bowl and place over a pot of simmering water and melt, whisking occasionally, until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt onto a piece of parchment or wax paper, or into a small bowl, and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, granulated sugar and light brown sugar until lightly and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla extract, and beat on high speed for 1 minute. On low speed beat in the melted chocolate mixture until just combined. Fold in the flour mixture with a rubber spatula until just combined. Stir in the pecans and chips. The batter will be loose. Cover and refrigerate until just firm, about 30 minutes. Using a small ice cream scoop (about 1 tablespoon size), scoop heaping tablespoons of the batter onto the prepared baking sheets, putting 8 cookies on each sheet. Bake for 10 to 11 minutes. The surface will be dry and shiny but the tops and insides will still be soft. It will take no longer than 10 to 11 minutes so set the time. Cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool 5 minutes longer. Repeat with the remaining batter. These cookies are best eaten the day they are made. Wrap leftovers well in plastic wrap and store in an airtight container.'

S'Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment or silicone pads.Whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda in a bowl. Place the butter in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the sugars and continue mixing, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes longer. Add the eggs, one at a time, and the vanilla extract. Add half of the flour mixture and mix until just incorporated. Add the remaining flour mixture, again mixing until just combined. Remove the bowl from the stand and fold in the chocolate chunks.Using a small ice cream scoop, spoon the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie, and bake on the middle rack until the cookies are lightly golden brown and still soft in the middle, about 11 minutes. Let the cookies rest for 2 minutes on the baking sheets before removing them to a baking rack with a wide metal spatula. Let the cookies cool on the baking rack for a few minutes before eating. Repeat with the remaining dough.'

Grill the shrimp on both sides until they are slightly charred and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. (Chef\\'s note: They can be left slightly undercooked since they will cook longer in the butter sauce.) Transfer the shrimp to a plate.Melt the butter in a large saute pan set over the grates of the grill. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, tarragon and thyme leaves and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the shrimp and cook, tossing once, about 1 minute.  Finish with the parsley and adjust the seasonings, if necessary.  Transfer the shrimp to a serving platter and garnish with thyme and parsley."

Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until a paring knife inserted comes out with some resistance. Do not cook the potatoes all the way through because they will continue cooking on the grill. Drain well and when cool enough to handle, slice in half lengthwise. Heat the grill to medium. Brush the chicken and potatoes with oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the chicken on the grill, skin-side down and grill until golden brown and slightly charred, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn the chicken over and continue grilling until just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. A few minutes before the chicken has finished cooking, place the potatoes on the grill, cut-side down and cook until lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn over and continue grilling about a minute longer. Remove the chicken and potatoes to a platter and immediately drizzle with the roasted garlic-oregano vinaigrette. Let rest 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with oregano sprigs and parsley sprigs.'

S'Special equipment: 4 egg cups; an egg topper, optionalFor the twists: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray lightly with nonstick spray.Whisk together the eggs, mustard and a splash of water until smooth; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.Dust a work surface with flour and roll out the puff pastry to a 10-by-14-inch rectangle with the shorter side facing you. Spread the cheese over the top half of the dough, then fold the bottom half over the cheese half and roll lightly to seal. Cut the dough vertically into 12 even strips; each strip will be slightly thinner than 1 inch.Place a bacon strip on each pastry strip and twist the pastry and bacon together. Place the twists on the prepared baking sheet, pressing down the ends. Brush the tops with some of the egg wash and sprinkle with salt and sesame seeds or poppy seeds (or both).Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the bacon is crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheet to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes before removing.For the eggs: Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat; there should be enough water to cover the eggs by at least 1 inch. Using tongs, gently place eggs in the water and boil for 5 1/2 minutes for soft-cooked eggs; the whites will be set, but the yolks will be very runny.Transfer the saucepan to the sink, pour off most of the water, and then run under cold water for 30 seconds. Set the soft-boiled eggs in egg cups; use an egg topper to slice off the tops of the shells, or tap around the shells with a small spoon to break and peel off. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and serve with the twists for dipping in the yolks.'

S'Mix together all the spices in a bowl. Liberally rub the entire brisket with the spices, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove the brisket from the refrigerator 1 hour before beginning the smoking process to take the chill off, and remove the plastic wrap.Get your smoker running at 225 degrees F with hardwood charcoal and a few handfuls of soaked wood chips. This temperature should be maintained throughout the entire smoke. (If you are using a grill: Set up the grill for indirect heat, banking the coals on one side of the grill and scattering the wood chips on top. Maintain the temperature at 225 degrees throughout the smoking process, adding chips as necessary until you wrap the brisket in foil.)Place the brisket fat-side up on your smoker grate and close it up for the long smoke.Open your barbecue smoker every hour or 2 and spray the brisket liberally with apple juice to help keep the meat from drying out. Also keep apple juice in the water pan if you are using a water smoker.When the internal temperature reaches 165 to 170 degrees, after about 4 hours, wrap the brisket in aluminum foil and continue to cook for another 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours. This little trick is a big help in getting the meat tender, especially for beginners. Figure that a brisket smoked at around 200 degrees will take about 1 1/2 hours per pound. The brisket is done when the internal temperature reaches 185 degrees F. Remove and let rest 20 minutes before slicing. Remove the foil from the brisket over a large pan or disposable pan and reserve the liquid. Cut off the brisket points and reserve for Honey-Rum Baked Pinto Beans with Burnt Ends.'

S'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.On a baking sheet, toss the tomatillos, garlic, jalapenos and onions with 1/4 cup canola oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until everything is nice and soft, 20 to 25 minutes. Reduce the oven heat to 200 degrees.Transfer the roasted vegetables to the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Pulse in the lime juice and honey. Set aside.Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large skillet. Add the shredded chicken, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring a bit, to just warm the chicken, about 2 minutes. Stir in the salsa and cook until warmed through, another 1 to 2 minutes. Cover and keep warm.Heat 2 tablespoons canola oil in a medium nonstick pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the chicken skin and cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 20 seconds. With a slotted spoon, remove the chicken skin to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt and pepper.Whisk together the eggs in a large baking dish until light and fluffy. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and add a few dashes of hot sauce if using.Heat 2 tablespoons canola oil in a large nonstick pan until it begins to shimmer. Dip a tortilla in the egg mixture and turn to coat; make sure the tortilla is totally submerged and fully covered in egg. Transfer the tortilla to the pan, letting excess egg run off; fry until golden brown on both sides, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.Stir the chopped cilantro into the chicken mixture. Spoon some of the chicken and salsa verde across the center of the tortillas, leaving 2-inch borders on either end. Top the chicken with some Cheddar and Monterey Jack and some of the crispy chicken skin. Fold the short sides of the tortilla over the ends of the chicken, then roll up into a burrito and place, seam-side down, on serving plate. Keep the first two burritos warm in the oven while you repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.To serve, dollop each burrito with some creme fraiche and garnish with cilantro leaves. Serve hot.'

Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld.Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Put a rack as close to the bottom as possible, and put a pizza stone on the rack.On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a very thin round. Sprinkle some corn meal onto the pizza peel. Transfer the dough to the pizza peel. Drizzle some olive oil over the dough, and season with salt and pepper. Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone and bake until the bottom is crisp and the edges browned, about 10 minutes.While the pizza dough cooks, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the canola oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and sugar and cook slowly until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; set aside.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and slowly cook until the fat is rendered and the bacon is golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Reserve the bacon fat in a small bowl.Remove the pizza dough from the oven. Top it with the Cheddar, cooked bacon and the onions, and return it to the oven to melt the cheese and finish cooking the dough, about 5 minutes.While the pizza finishes cooking, pour 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat into a medium nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter. Add the chile and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Whisk the eggs together in a bowl until very smooth, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into the pan and stir constantly with a rubber spatula until soft curds form, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the goat cheese pieces and remove from the heat.Remove the pizza from the oven to a cutting board. Top with the scrambled eggs. Drizzle some of the herbed creme fraiche over the eggs, and scatter the remaining herbs over the top. Slice and serve. (You can also slice the pizza into wedges, plate them, and top each serving.)'

Drain well and cool slightly.Preheat the grill to medium for direct heat. Cut the potatoes in half, toss with some of the mustard aioli and sprinkle with salt. Place the potatoes cut-side down on the grill and grill until lightly golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the potatoes and grill until golden brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes.

S'Heat oven to 325 degrees F.Place a 5-quart casserole or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add oil, and heat until it is almost smoking. Season short ribs generously with salt and pepper. Working in batches if necessary, add short ribs to the hot oil. Cook ribs until browned on both sides. Remove ribs from casserole, and transfer to a large bowl. Set aside. Meanwhile, prepare bouquet garni: Place bay leaf, rosemary, thyme, and parsley in the center of a square of cheesecloth. Bring edges together, and tie with kitchen string. Set bouquet garni aside.Add carrots, celery, onion, and shallots to oil in the casserole, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and golden, about 10 minutes.Add flour and tomato paste to the casserole, and stir to combine. Add ruby port; stir with wooden spoon until all browned bits have been scraped from the pan and the bottom of the casserole is clean. Add red wine, and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half. Add garlic, beef stock, and the reserved bouquet garni.Return browned ribs to the casserole. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover the casserole, and place it in the oven. Cook until ribs are very tender, about 3 hours.  Remove the cooked ribs from the casserole. Set the casserole on the stove top over medium heat, and simmer to thicken sauce just slightly. As soon as the short ribs are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones, and shred into small pieces. Degrease the sauce and discard the bouquet garni. Return shredded meat to casserole, and simmer to reduce sauce by about half.Fill a large pot with water and add a few tablespoons of salt. Set over high heat, and bring to a boil. Salt well, and stir in pasta. Cook until pasta is al dente. Drain pasta, and serve with short-rib ragu, sprinkle with the parsley. Serve with freshly grated Percorino Romano.'

S'Bring the water, apple juice, salt, sugar, onion, peppercorns, mustard seeds, thyme and bay leaves to a simmer in a large stock pot and cook until the sugar and salt is dissolved. Let cool completely. Submerge the roast in the brine by placing a plate on top, cover with plastic and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the pork from the brine, rinse under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Season the pork on both sides with salt and pepper and cook on both sides until golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer the pork to a baking sheet, brush with some of the glaze and finish cooking in the oven until cooked to an internal temperature of 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 to 40 minutes, brushing with the glaze every 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, let rest loosely tented with foil for 10 minutes.Add the shallots to the saute pan (that the pork was browned in) and cook until soft. Add the whiskey, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon and cook until almost completely reduced. Add the chicken broth and brown sugar and bring to a boil and cook until reduced to a sauce consistency. Whisk in the butter, season with salt and pepper and stir in the parsley.Slice the rack into chops and place on a large plate, drizzle a little of the sauce around the pork chop and top with some of the butter. Garnish with parsley sprigs.'

Add the flour slowly, making a stiff dough that is silky smooth.Turn dough out into a large oiled bowl, cover with a cloth. Place dough in a warm place, and allow to double in bulk.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Pound and knead the dough, until it is silky smooth. Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and let rise again, until doubled in bulk.Meanwhile, sterilize the palmetto leaves or shoe strings by soaking them in boiling water.Portion dough into 10-ounce loaves. As a loaf is formed, immediately place a palmetto leaf or shoestring down the length of the loaf, and turn the loaf over onto a baking sheet, leaf/string side down. Repeat with the remaining loaves.Let the dough rise, leaf side down, for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Bake loaves until they are golden brown, about 30 minutes.This recipe was provided by professional chefs, and therefore may be difficult to reproduce in the home.'

S'Bring the cream to a simmer over low heat in a small saucepan. Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan over high heat and cook, without stirring until amber brown. Slowly whisk in the warm cream until smooth and let cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the peanut butter, corn syrup, sea salt and 1/8 teaspoon of vanilla extract until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl and let cool until thickened at room temperature, about 30 minutes.Put a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with foil, leaving an overhang on the narrow ends. Spray the foil and pan with nonstick spray.Combine the butter, unsweetened chocolate, 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate and espresso powder in a medium bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Let the chocolate melt over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, both sugars, vanilla and salt until smooth. Whisk in the melted chocolate mixture until combined.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the flour in 2 additions (the batter will be thick). Stir in the remaining 4 ounces of chopped bittersweet chocolate.Scrape half of the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Using a tablespoon, drop dollops of half of the peanut butter caramel every 2 inches over the top of the batter.  Carefully add the remaining batter and smooth over the caramel. Smooth the top and dollop the remaining caramel over the top.  Use a butter knife to swirl through the batter to get a marbleized effect.Bake until the top is set but still soft and the edges are puffed and just beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 23 to 25 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the center will come out still gooey (be brave!--underbaking the brownies is one of the secrets to their fudgy texture). Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely.For the neatest cuts, refrigerate the pan for about 20 minutes before cutting the brownies. Using the foil, lift the brownie slab out of the pan. Carefully peel off the foil and put the brownie on a large cutting board. With a large sharp knife, cut the brownies into 48 squares. (The brownies can be stored in an airtight container, at room temperature, for up to 3 days; they can also be frozen, well wrapped, for up to 2 weeks.)'

S'For the vinaigrette: Combine the onions, vinegar, mustard and a few tablespoons of cold water in a blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and continue to blend until emulsified. Add the honey and some salt and pepper and pulse a few more times to combine.For the hash browns: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden brown and caramelized, about 30 minutes. Add the thyme and season with salt and pepper.While the onions are caramelizing, put potatoes in a medium pot of cold, salted water. Bring the water to a boil and cook until nearly tender but a knife inserted into the centers still meets a little resistance, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain through a colander and then drain on paper towels.Heat the remaining butter and oil on a cast-iron griddle or in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and cook, pressing firmly with a spatula, until the underside is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the caramelized onions and a drizzle of the green onion vinaigrette and toss to coat. Transfer the hash to a platter and drizzle with the remaining green onion vinaigrette.'

Add the buttermilk and mix gently until the mixture just begins to come together.Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter. Pat into a 10-by-12-inch rectangle, about 3/4 inch thick. Use a 2-inch round cutter to cut out biscuits. Press together the scraps and repeat.Place the biscuits 2 inches apart on the baking sheet; brush the tops with the cream and sprinkle with pepper (use 2 teaspoons total). Bake until light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Brush the biscuits with the melted butter and transfer them to a wire rack to cool at least slightly.Photograph by Con Poulos'

S"Special equipment: a waffle ironFor the waffles: Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt in a large bowl.In a second bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth, then whisk in the buttermilk and butter until combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix just until the batter comes together; there will be lumps. Cover and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Set a baking rack over baking sheet and place on the center rack. Preheat a waffle maker according to manufacturer\\'s instructions and brush with melted butter.For each waffle, ladle about 1/3 cup of the batter onto the iron. Cover and cook until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes; the waffles will be a little misshapen--not perfectly square, with rounded corners. As you go, transfer the cooked waffles to the baking rack in the oven and hold there while you fry the chicken.For the fried chicken: While the waffle batter rests, place the chicken tenders in a resealable plastic bag. Add 1 cup of the buttermilk and the hot sauce, then seal the bag and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.In a medium bowl, combine the flour with the garlic powder, onion powder, chile de arbol, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Transfer half of the flour mixture to a second bowl. In a third bowl, put the remaining 1 cup buttermilk.Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.Heat 2 inches of oil in a high-sided skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium heat until it registers 360 degrees on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, dredge the chicken in the first dish of seasoned flour, then dip in the buttermilk, letting excess drain off, and finally dredge in the second bowl of seasoned flour, tapping off excess. Fry until golden brown on both sides and just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt.To serve, put two waffles on each of four plates. Top them with three tenders and drizzle all with hot sauce, if desired, and honey."

Place the pies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper to chill for 30 minutes.Heat the oil in a large saucepan until it reaches 360 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Fry the pies, 2 at a time until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Let drain for 10 seconds then toss with the cinnamon sugar. Serve.'

S"Click here to see how it\\'s done.For the Dry Rub:Add all the dry rub ingredients into a medium-sized bowl and stir until thoroughly combined.For the pork shoulder:Place the pork, fat side up, on a clean baking sheet.  Season the pork on all sides with salt and pepper then rub the dry rub all over the pork, pressing into the meat.  Cover the pork with plastic wrap and place into the refrigerator for 7 hours.Black Pepper Vinegar Sauce:Place all the ingredients into a blender and blend until emulsified.  Add water if the sauce is too thick.Green Onion Slaw:Place the green onions, vinegar, chiles, mayonnaise, salt, pepper and oil into a blender and blend until emulsified.  Place the cabbage and red onions in a bowl, add the dressing and stir until combined.  Fold in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper, to taste.For the pork shoulder:Remove the pork from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to cooking.Following manufacturer\\'s instructions and using lump charcoal and 1/2 cup drained wood chips for a smoker, or 1 cup for a barbecue, start fire and bring temperature of smoker or barbecue to 225 degrees F to 250 degrees F.  Place the pork on the rack in smoker or barbecue.  Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork reaches 165 degrees F.  Turn pork every 45 minutes, about 6 hours total.  If using the smoker, after 2 hours place the pork into the smoker pan and fill halfway with chicken stock.  (This is to prevent the shoulder from drying out.)Add more charcoal, as needed, to maintain 225 degrees F to 250 degrees F and more wood drained wood chips (1/2 cup for the smoker or 1 cup for the barbecue with each addition) to maintain smoke level.Transfer pork to a clean rimmed baking sheet.  Let stand until cool enough to handle.  Shred into bite-size pieces.  Mound on platter and toss with most of the Black Pepper Vinegar Sauce, reserving the rest for drizzling the bun.  Pour any juice from the baking sheet over the pork.Chef\\'s Note: This can be made 1 day ahead.  Transfer the pork and any juices to a baking dish.  Cover with foil and chill.  Before continuing, re-warm pork, covered, in a 350 degrees F oven for about 30 minutes.For assembly:Drizzle the sauce on the top and bottom of the bun.  Top the bottom bun with the meat, another drizzle of sauce, Green Onion Slaw and finish with the top of the bun."

S"Light several chimney starters filled with charcoal and let burn until the briquettes are covered with gray ash. Put the charcoal in the center of the bottom of a large kettle grill, place the grate on and cover the grill. Let heat for at least 30 minutes before cooking.Brush the chicken with some of the canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the chicken skin-side down on the cooler part of the grill (the outer rim), to cook indirectly and slowly, and put the lid on. Cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides and almost completely cooked through, about 12 minutes for breasts and 15 minutes for thighs and wings. Remove to a sheet pan. Cut the breasts into 3 or 4 pieces.Combine the chicken stock and saffron in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer, either on the hot part of the grill or on a burner. Add the clams, cover and cook until the clams open, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the clams to a bowl. Add the mussels to the broth, cover and cook until the mussels open, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Discard any shellfish that don\\'t open.Brush the shrimp, the cut sides of the lobsters, scallops, and cut sides of the lemons with some of the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper on all sides. Grill the shrimp for about 1 minute per side. Grill the lobster cut-side down until charred and just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove the claws and the tails but leave the shells on; discard the bodies. Grill the scallops until slightly charred and almost cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Grill the lemon cut-side down until charred, about 45 seconds. Remove all ingredients to sheet pans.Heat 3 tablespoons canola oil in a large paella pan over direct heat. Add the onions and cook until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the chorizo and cook, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes.Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, for a few minutes. Begin adding the stock 1 cup at a time and cook, stirring constantly, until the rice is al dente, about 25 minutes.Arrange the chicken, clams mussels, shrimp, scallop, peas, lobster and piquillo peppers in the rice. Squeeze the juice from 4 of the lemon halves over the top, and nestle the 4 other halves in the rice. Scatter the parsley over the top. Stir gently to bring some of the rice up from the bottom, and serve."

Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.Meanwhile, preheat the grill to high for direct grilling. Divide the ground chuck into four equal portions, 6 ounces each. Form each portion into a 3/4-inch burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Brush both sides of the burgers with the oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Grill the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on both sides and cooked to desired doneness, about 4 minutes each side for medium doneness. During the last minute of cooking, place a dollop of the cheese mixture on top of each burger and close the grill lid. Cook until the cheese has just melted, about 1 minute.Place the burgers on the buns and top with the bacon, onions, tomatoes, pickles and lettuce if desired.'

S'Prepare the grill for direct and indirect cooking.Once the grill is hot (you can hold your hands an inch over the grates for no more than 2 seconds), stretch and shape the dough into a 12-inch round on a flat surface. Brush the top with oil, salt and pepper and toss on the grill, oil-side down. Cook until the bottom is golden brown, 1 minute. Check the bottom of the dough to see if it is getting browned. If it is on one part, but not the other, use a spatula or tongs to rotate the dough 90 degrees and cook for another minute. If it is still not beginning to brown, cover the grill and continue to cook a minute at a time until the bottom has browned evenly. (It should only take a couple minutes if you have a hot grill.) The top of the pizza dough will also start bubbling up with air pockets.Once the pizza dough has browned on the bottom, flip over and grill until golden brown and the dough is just firm, another minute or so. Remove to a sheet pan. Cover the grill so it retains the heat for the next step.Drizzle the top with more olive oil. Put the mozzarella and tomato slices on top and season with salt and pepper. Return the pizza to the grill on the sheet pan, cover the grill and cook for 3 or 4 minutes to melt the cheese. Remove from the grill and tear the basil leaves over the top. Slice and serve immediately.'

S'Make the rub: Whisk all the spice rub ingredients in a small bowl. Make the bbq sauce: Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Add the onion and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in 1/2 cup of the bourbon and cook until reduced. Add the ketchup and water, bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining ingredients and simmer until thickened, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.Cool for about 5 minutes, then transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Pour into a bowl, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of bourbon and allow to cool at room temperature. The sauce will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator stored in a tightly sealed container. Heat the grill to medium heat. Brush the chicken with the 1/4 cup of oil and season on both sides with the spice rub. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Grill the chicken slowly, with the lid closed, until golden brown on both sides and fat has rendered. Begin brushing the chicken liberally with the bbq sauce during the last 10 minutes of grilling. Arrange on a serving platter and serve.'

Remove the ribs from the refrigerator 45 minutes before smoking to allow them to come to room temperature.Stuff several sheets of newspaper in the bottom of a charcoal chimney. Fill the chimney to the top with charcoal briquettes. Remove top rack from the barbecue. Put the chimney on the lower barbecue rack. Light the newspaper and let the charcoal burn until the ash is gray, about 20 minutes.Open bottom barbecue vent. Turn out the hot charcoal onto 1 half of bottom rack. Using a metal spatula, spread charcoal to cover approximately 1/3 of rack and scatter half of the soaked wood chips over the charcoal. Put a loaf pan with water onto the coals.Put the top rack on the barbecue. Put the ribs, rub side down, on the grill over indirect heat. Coals should be off to 1 side. Slowly cook the ribs until tender, adding more charcoal if needed, about 1 1/2 hours.Chipotle Honey Glaze:Whisk all of the ingredients together in a small bowlBegin brushing the glaze on the ribs during the last 30 minutes of cooking.Put the ribs on a baking sheet; brush with a little more of the glaze and let stand 10 minutes.

S'Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper and spray liberally with vegetable spray.Combine the water, sugar, yeast, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix with the dough hook until combined.  Let sit for 5 minutes.Add the salt and flour and mix on low speed until combined.  Increase the speed to medium and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and begins to pull away from the side of the bowl, about 3 to 4 minutes.  If the dough appears too wet, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Remove the dough from the bowl, place on a flat surface and knead into a ball with your hands.Oil a bowl with vegetable oil, add the dough and turn to coat with the oil.  Cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Bring the water to a boil in a small roasting pan over high heat and add the baking soda.Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a flat surface.  Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, about 4 1/4 to 4 1/2 ounces each.  Roll each piece into a long rope measuring 22 inches and shape: take the right side and cross over to the left.  Cross right to left again and flip up.  Boil the pretzels in the water solution, 2 at a time for 30 seconds, splashing the tops with the warmed water using a spoon.  Remove with a large flat slotted spatula or a spider.  Place 4 pretzels on each baking sheet, brush the tops with the egg wash and season liberally with the salt.  Place into the oven and bake for 15 to 18 minutes until golden brown.Remove to a baking rack and let rest 5 minutes before eating.  Dip into desired sauces.'

(Can be made 1 hour before and kept at room temperature.)Preheat the grill for high direct heat.Remove the top shells of the oysters. Loosen the oysters from the bottom shells but do not remove, taking care not to spill the liquor. Put the oysters on the grill, cover and cook just until the edges start to curl, about 1 minute.Meanwhile, wet the kosher salt with water just until it clumps together. Spoon little mounds of salt onto a large platter. Place a cooked oyster on each salt bed and top each with some vinaigrette. Scatter the parsley leaves over the platter and serve.'

S"For the prime rib: Rub the prime rib with the spice rub, put in the refrigerate on a rack set over a baking sheet (uncovered) and let marinate for at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours.For the red wine steak sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and shallots and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, increase the heat to high and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine, ketchup, 1/2 cup water, raisins, molasses, brown sugar, horseradish, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire, cayenne, allspice and salt and pepper to taste and cook for 10 minutes longer. Add a splash of red wine vinegar, and taste for salt and pepper. Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Let cool to room temperature.Prepare your grill using a kamada-style grill, kettle grill, bullet smoker or gas grill method for smoking. Remove the prime rib from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking and let sit at room temperature. Sprinkle well with salt and put the prime rib, fat-side up, on the grill grate. Maintaining a temperature of about 250 degrees F (if using a kettle grill or bullet smoker, replenish fire with unlit coals, as needed, to maintain temperature; see manufacturer\\'s instructions), cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center reads 130 degrees F, between 3 1/2 to 4 hours. During the last hour of cooking (at about 110 degrees F), begin brushing with some of the red wine steak sauce and stop adding chips to the smoker. Remove the prime rib from the grill, brush with more of the red wine steak sauce and let rest, loosely covered with foil, for 20 minutes before slicing."

S'For the black beans: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds. Add the beans, 1/2 cup water, and the chipotle and cook, stirring occasionally, until the water is reduced and beans are heated through and soft, about 20 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash the beans into a chunky paste. Taste, and season with salt as necessary. Stir in the cilantro, and then spread on a baking sheet to cool.For the salsa: Put the avocados, tomatoes, green onions, serrano and some salt and pepper in a large bowl and fold together. Fold in the lime juice, oil, cilantro and watercress. Set aside.For the chorizo filling: Heat the oil in a large skillet until it begins to shimmer. Add the chorizo and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 8 minutes, stirring a few times. With a slotted spoon, remove the sausage to a paper-towel-lined plate.Add the onions and peppers to the pan drippings and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8 minutes. If the chorizo is in large chunks, chop it coarsely, then stir it into the onions and peppers. Add the eggs, and scramble until soft curds form. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the cilantro and remove from the heat.To assemble: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Brush a nonstick baking sheet with some oil. Spread a thin layer of the beans across the center of a tortilla, leaving a 1-inch border. Top with some of the chorizo filling and a handful of Monterey Jack. Fold in the sides of the tortilla, and then roll from the bottom into a tight cylinder. Place seam-side down on the baking sheet and repeat with remaining tortillas, beans, filling and cheese. Brush the tops and sides of the burritos with canola oil, and bake until golden brown and crispy, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a platter, and top with Avocado-Tomato-Watercress Salsa, cotija and cilantro leaves. Garnish the platter with lime wedges.'

S'Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.Spread the coconut evenly onto a baking sheet and toast until lightly golden brown, stirring once, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the oven and let the coconut sit in the oven until very dry and crunchy, about 15 minutes longer.For the simple syrup:Bring water and sugar to a boil. Stir in the coconut, remove from the heat and let sit for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. Strain the liquid into a clean saucepan, bring to a boil and let cook until the mixture is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Let cool.For the custard:Combine the milks and vanilla bean and seeds in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat.Whisk together the yolks, sugar and cornstarch in a large bowl. Slowly whisk the warm milk into the egg mixture then return the mixture to the pot over medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly, until thickened. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and whisk in the rum and vanilla extract. Let cool to room temperature then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours.For the filling:Combine the custard and cream in a bowl and whip until soft peaks form.For the buttercream:Beat the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the coconut custard and salt and beat until combined and smooth.For the cake:Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour 2 (9 by 2-inch) round cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper.Whisk together the milk, egg whites, vanilla bean seeds and vanilla extract in a medium bowl.In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. With mixer running at low speed, add the butter, one piece at a time and continue beating until mixture resembles moist crumbs. Add all but 1/2 cup of milk mixture to crumbs and beat at medium speed until the mixture is pale and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes. With mixer on low speed, add remaining 1/2 cup of the milk mixture, increase speed to medium and beat 30 seconds more. Scrape sides of bowl and mix for 20 seconds longer. Divide the batter evenly between the cakes pan and smooth the tops using a rubber spatula.Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs attached, 22 to 24 minutes.  Cool in the pan on baking rack for 10 minutes. Run a small knife around the side of the pan and invert cakes onto the baking rack, removing parchment paper, and let cool completely, about 45 minutes.To Assemble:Using a long serrated knife, slice each cake horizontally into 2 layers. Reserve 1 of the flat bottom layers for the top of the cake. Place another layer on a cardboard round cut side up and brush with some of the coconut simple syrup. Spoon 1/3 of the coconut filling onto the cake and using a small offset metal spatula, spread it into an even layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the cake. Repeat with 2 more layers. Brush the cut side of the reserved cake layer with the remaining syrup. Place the layer cut side down on top of the cake.Frost the sides and top of the cake with the buttercream. Pat the coconut onto the sides of the cake and sprinkle the remaining coconut on the top of the cake.'

S"Make the donut batter: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the eggs and sugar in a medium bowl until the sugar is dissolved, then whisk in the sour cream, milk and vanilla until combined. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in the wet ingredients until just combined; the batter will be lumpy. Fold in the butter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and rest the batter for at least 15 minutes.Make the cinnamon-sugar: Whisk together the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.Make the vanilla glaze: Combine 2 tablespoons milk and the vanilla extract in a small bowl. Put the confectioners\\' sugar in a small bowl. Slowly whisk the milk mixture into the confectioners\\' sugar until smooth. If the mixture doesn\\'t fall in a slow ribbon when you lift the whisk, drizzle in some of the remaining milk until it does.Make the chocolate ganache: Put the chocolate in a heat-safe bowl. Bring the cream to a simmer. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, shake the bowl to evenly cover the chocolate with hot cream and let the mixture sit for 1 minute before whisking until smooth. Set aside; keep warm.Finish the waffle donuts: Heat the waffle iron according to the manufacturers\\' instructions. Lightly coat the waffle grid with nonstick pan spray and add 1/4 cup of batter to each waffle grid. Close the iron and cook until the waffles are lightly golden-brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the waffles to a cutting board and repeat with the remaining batter.Set a cooling rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Heat 3 inches of oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Use a 3-inch cookie cutter to stamp circles from the waffles; then use a smaller cookie cutter to stamp out a smaller circle from the center of each waffle. Add 3 or 4 waffles to the oil and fry until golden-brown and crisp, about 20 seconds on each side. Transfer the waffle donuts to the cooling rack and cool for just a few seconds before dipping both sides of each waffle donut in the cinnamon sugar. Repeat frying with the remaining waffles, dipping some of each of the following batch in the vanilla glaze and others in the chocolate ganache. Garnish the chocolate and vanilla-dipped waffle donuts with chopped nuts and/or sprinkles and serve warm."

S'For the shrimp stock: In a large saucepan over high heat, heat the oil until almost smoking. Add the shrimp shells and tails, onion, carrot and celery and saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, then add 10 cups of cold water, the tomatoes, parsley, bay leaf and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, skimming the surface occasionally, for 40 minutes.Strain the stock through a strainer lined with cheesecloth into a large bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids. The stock can be made 2 days in advance and stored tightly covered in the refrigerator, or frozen up to 3 months.For the tomato aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, anchovies, tomato powder, tomato paste, green onion, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.For the broth: Heat the oil in a large, high-sided saute pan over high heat and cook the fennel and onion until they begin to soften. Add the pastis and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, saffron, chile flakes and 2 cups of the shrimp stock. Bring to a boil, add the garlic and cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.  Add 4 more cups of shrimp stock, reduce the heat and cook until the flavors meld and the broth reduces slightly, about 20 minutes.  Strain the shrimp-tomato broth into a large bowl, discard the solids, pour the liquid back into the high-sided saute pan and set aside.For the anchovy butter: Put the anchovies and butter in a bowl and mix until combined. Season with salt and pepper, cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 20 minutes.For the seafood: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Season the scallops on both sides with salt and pepper. Sear the scallops on one side until golden brown, about 2 minutes, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds. Remove to a baking sheet.Add another tablespoon of the oil to the pan and season both sides of the halibut fillets with salt and pepper. Sear on one side until golden brown, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds. Remove to the baking sheet with the scallops.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the large saute pan, season the shrimp with salt and pepper and sear until the shells become lightly golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Deglaze the pan with 1 cup of the reserved shrimp-tomato broth. Transfer the liquid to the remaining shrimp-tomato broth in the high-sided saute pan.Heat the shrimp-tomato broth over high heat. Add the mussels, cover and cook until they open, about 2 minutes. Remove the mussels to the baking sheet with a slotted spoon and discard any that did not open.Add the seared seafood and lobster tails to the shrimp-tomato broth, cover and let cook for 2 minutes.To serve: Add the anchovy butter to the broth and cook until thickened; stir in the parsley, tarragon and lemon zest. Top each baguette slice with a large dollop of tomato aioli and garnish with chives. Divide the seafood and broth among 6 large, slightly shallow soup bowls. Top each with a tomato aioli crouton and garnish with more parsley or tarragon or chives, if desired.'

Place honey drizzled piece of bread on top of a piece with bananas on it to make a sandwich. Repeat until you have made 3 sandwiches.In a shallow medium sized bowl, gently whip, by hand, the eggs, cream, vanilla, rum, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Heat skillet to medium heat, around 350 to375 degrees F, or until butter melts and begins to sizzle. Dip 1 sandwich at a time into rum batter and place into skillet.

S'Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead with lightly floured hands. Slap the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself using a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape dough from surface. Repeat the process until the dough is easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes.Lightly oil a bowl with olive oil. Shape the dough into 2 balls and transfer to the bowl. Turn to coat the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. The dough is done when you press it with your finger and an indent remains.Gently remove the dough from the bowl. Roll each dough half into a ball and place on a lightly-floured baking sheet. Brush the dough balls lightly with olive oil. Cover the baking sheet lightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes.Prepare charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash). Add to the grill, creating a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, and leaving the other half with no coals.Stretch and shape each piece of dough into a 10-inch-round on a flat surface. Brush the tops of each round with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the rounds on the grilling stones and cook until the bottoms are lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush the tops of the rounds with oil, flip and cook until the bottoms are lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.For the assembly: Whisk the creme fraiche, chopped herbs, zest together and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the creme fraiche mixture on top of each cooked dough round. Flake some of the smoked salmon and place on top of the creme fraiche mixture. Top with the capers and onions. Garnish with whole herbs. Serve immediately.'

Turn the heat to low and let the mixture heat for about 10 minutes; the oil should just barely simmer around the garlic in the last few minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Transfer to a blender, add the 1 tablespoon oregano and some salt and pepper, and blend until the garlic and oregano are finely chopped. Set aside half of the chile-garlic oil for serving.Heat the grill to high. Thread the shrimp onto skewers, about 4 or 5 shrimp per skewer, threading so that the skewers goes through the tail and thick end of each shrimp. Brush the shrimp with some of the chile-garlic oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until lightly golden brown on both sides and opaque, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer the skewers to a platter and immediately drizzle with some of the reserved chile-garlic oil (not the oil you used for brushing the raw shrimp). Garnish with oregano, and serve with more of the reserved oil.'

S"Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in the shortening and 1/4 cup butter pats until pea-size bits remain. Add the milk and gently stir until combined. The dough will be wet.Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface and gently pat into a 9-inch round that is 1-inch thick. Cut the dough into 2-inch rounds using a cookie cutter. Transfer the rounds to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet that has been lightly coated with cooking spray. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Remove the towel and cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 1 hour and up to 24 hours.Cook\\'s Note: The longer the biscuits stay in the freezer, the lighter and fluffier they become. You can make ahead and just bake off a few as you need them.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the heavy cream and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops with the melted butter. Let cool slightly, then sprinkle the top with black pepper and slice open.Heat 1 tablespoon of the unsalted butter in a small (6-inch) nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat until it begins to sizzle. Add one egg at a time, season top with salt and pepper and cook until the white is set, gently flip over and continue cooking for another minute or so. Flip so the top side is up. Place a few slices of ham on the bottom biscuit and top with the egg, place the other half of the biscuit on top and serve immediately."

S"Special equipment: butcher\\'s twineFor the mustard sauce: Whisk together the honey, Dijon mustard, whole-grain mustard and horseradish in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover and let sit to allow the flavors to meld while you make the chicken.For the chicken roulade: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Heat 2 tablespoons of the canola oil over low heat in a large saute pan. Add the garlic and red chile flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Increase the heat, stir in the baby arugula, season with salt and pepper and cook until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Set aside.Drizzle the chicken breasts with a little oil and thinly pound between 2 sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Put the breasts on a flat surface skin-side down, and sprinkle the top sides with salt and pepper. Place 2 slices of the ham on each breast; spread 2 ounces of the cheese over the ham and then top with one-quarter of the arugula in the center. Roll the breasts tightly and tie with butcher\\'s twine. Sprinkle the roulade with salt and pepper.Heat a large ovenproof saute pan over high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and cook until it begins to shimmer. Put the rolls in the pan seam-side up and add the butter. Cook until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue cooking until the breasts are just cooked through and the cheese has melted, 4 to 5 minutes.Remove the rolls to a plate and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with the mustard sauce and topped with a bit of micro arugula."

S'For the orange-ginger glaze: Combine the juice, sugar, tamari, peppercorns, ground pepper, salt, anise and ginger in a saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half. Strain and cool.For the grilled boneless short ribs: Toss the ribs with 1/2 cup of the glaze, reserving the remaining glaze. Set aside the ribs at room temperature for 30 minutes.Prepare the grill for direct grilling at medium-high heat. Remove the ribs from the glaze, shaking off the excess. Brush the ribs with the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the ribs until nicely charred and still pink in the middle, about 3 minutes each side. Brush the ribs occasionally with the reserved glaze.For the green onion-peanut relish: Combine the peanuts, onions, sugar, allspice, cinnamon and sprinkle lightly with salt.Transfer the ribs to a platter and top with the green onion-peanut relish.'

S'For the fresh mozzarella: Prepare a bowl of salted warm water and a separate bowl of salted ice water. In the salted warm water, soften the mozzarella curd and pull and shape into a ball. Drop into the salted ice bath to cool. Set aside and pat dry. Slice and let dry on a paper-towel-lined plate.For the tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Increase the heat to high and add the tomatoes and oregano if using. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning (adding a pinch of sugar if needed) and stir in the basil.For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking rack over a baking sheet and set aside.Put the breadcrumbs, flour and beaten eggs in separate shallow dishes and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sprinkle each chicken breast on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge each breast in the flour and tap off any excess, then dip in the egg wash and let the excess drip off. Finally, dredge in the breadcrumbs. Transfer the breasts to a baking sheet or large plate.Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook 2 breasts at a time in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the breasts to the baking rack on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts and oil. Place in the oven to cook further for a couple minutes, then remove and set aside.Change the oven setting to broil.For the arugula salad: Dress the arugula in a large bowl with the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper and toss together.Top each chicken breast with some tomato sauce and mozzarella slices. Broil until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese has melted, 1 to 3 minutes.Place some arugula salad on each plate next to a chicken piece. Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan, chopped basil and parsley sprigs.'

S'Heat a skillet over high heat. Add the canola oil and chorizo and start to brown, about 2 minutes. Then add about half the jalapeno and cook until the chorizo is golden brown and cooked through, stirring occasionally. Set aside.Heat the butter in a small nonstick pan over medium heat. Whisk the eggs in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Cook the eggs by whisking constantly and shaking the pan vigorously until the eggs begin to set but are still quite loose. Spoon the chorizo mixture down the center, top with the remaining jalapeno slices and the cheese, and continue cooking until almost completely set, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, depending on desired consistency. Fold the omelet into thirds, and turn it out onto a cutting board or a plate.Over a burner on medium heat, soften the tortilla, 8 to 10 seconds on each side, or in a skillet over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes per side. Gently place the omelet onto the tortilla and wrap around it tightly. Slice in half on a diagonal.'

S'Special equipment: 2 large cast-iron or other heavy skillets; 2 bricks wrapped in foilFor the salsa verde: Put the parsley, tarragon, cornichons, garlic, anchovies, vinegar, capers and some salt and pepper in a food processor. Pulse a few times to coarsely chop the herbs. With the machine running, drizzle in the olive oil to make a thick but pourable sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.For the pressed chicken: Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-low.Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Line up the breasts skin-side down on the grill and lay a piece of foil on top to cover; do the same with the thighs. Set a heavy skillet on top of the breasts and a second skillet atop the thighs. Weight each skillet with a foil-wrapped brick. Cover the grill and cook, checking for color once or twice, until the skin is deep golden-brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the bricks, skillets and foil and set aside. Flip the chicken, cover the grill and cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, another 5 to 10 minutes depending on thickness.Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut each breast through the bone into 3 or 4 pieces and transfer to a platter along with the whole thighs. Drizzle the chicken with some salsa verde. Serve the remaining salsa verde on the side.'

When you see a wisp of smoke, add the fillets to the pan (do not overcrowd the pan to achieve a proper sear, so cook in batches if you have to). Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the butter per fillet to the pan. Cook the turbot on both sides until lightly golden brown and just cooked through, about 2 minutes total. Remove to a plate.Deglaze the pan with the white wine over medium-high heat and let cook all the way down to a dry pan. Add the remaining butter to the saute pan and cook until slightly golden brown. Add the capers and lemon juice, and then add the fish back to the pan. Baste the fish with some of the sauce to warm. Remove from heat, add the tarragon and season with salt and pepper if necessary.Put each fillet on a plate and spoon the sauce over the fish. Garnish with the lemon zest and a sprig of tarragon.'

Transfer the meat to a rack set on a baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven while you make the gravy.Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the skillet, leaving the crunchy pieces from the breading. Add the bacon and cook until golden brown and crisp.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.Return the skillet to the stove over medium heat. Whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour into the pan and let it cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the warm milk and continue to cook, whisking occasionally until thickened.

S"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Add all the ingredients for the crust to a food processor and pulse until combined; it should feel like wet sand, and just come together.Spread the mixture evenly into a 9-inch pie pan, using your finger tips or the flat bottom of a glass. Firmly press the mixture over the bottom and sides of the pan.Put the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the crust is light brown and firm to the touch, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.For the filling:Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Whisk together the eggs, yolks and sugars in a large bowl.  Add the butter, pumpkin, cream, spices, salt and vanilla seeds and whisk to combine. Strain the mixture into a bowl. Pour the strained mixture into the baked pie crust and bake until almost set, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove and let come to room temperature.  Refrigerate until chilled, if preferred. Cook\\'s Note: The filling makes more than what is needed to fill the pie shell. You are able to freeze the excess. We made a double batch and it filled 3 pie shells very comfortably.For the whipped cream:Combine the cream, vanilla seeds, syrup and bourbon in a large chilled bowl and whip until soft peaks form. Garnish each piece of pie with a dollop of the whipped cream before serving."

S"Prepare a kettle grill with charcoal off to one side for indirect grilling and add the soaked apple wood or mesquite wood chips over the coals. Remove the neck and giblets and pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Brush chicken all over with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper and 3 tablespoons dry rub. Set aside.Open the beer can, pour out about 1/2 cup of the beer into a cup and drink it (or pour it over the wood chips). Make an extra hole in the top of the can with a church-key can opener. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon dry rub to the beer can (it might fizz up a little bit at the top, but don\\'t worry, that is normal), the garlic and rosemary.Hold the chicken above the can of beer and slide the chicken over the can. Fold the wings back behind the chicken. Make sure the legs are in front of the can, supporting the chicken. Place the chicken inside a disposable pan.Place the pan on the grates of the grill on the opposite side of the charcoals, put lid on and cook the chicken until golden brown and the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F in the breast area and 175 degrees F in the thigh area on an instant-read thermometer, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the grill (be careful not to spill the contents of the beer can as it will be very hot) and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.Use a pair of locking tongs and grab the bottom of the beer can to remove from the chicken cavity. Place on a platter or cutting board to rest and cool. Carve and serve."

S"For the sausage: Combine the pork, garlic, sage, thyme, onion powder, and oil in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover the sausage and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Cook\\'s Note: The sausage can be prepared 8 hours in advance and refrigerated. Form the sausage mixture into 8 patties. Heat a large nonstick pan over high heat and cook the patties until golden brown on both sides and just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. For the black pepper buttermilk biscuits: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Using a dough cutter, combine the ingredients until they are incorporated. Cut in the butter using your fingers or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the buttermilk and gently mix until the mixture just begins to come together. Scrape the dough onto a lightly-floured counter. Pat the dough into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Use a 2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Press together the scraps of dough, and repeat the process. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; brush the tops with cream and sprinkle with the black pepper. Bake the biscuits for 12 to 15 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool on a baking rack. Yields: 10 to 12 biscuitsFor the cream sauce: Put the milk in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Melt the butter in a second small saucepan over medium heat, whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, do not allow the flour to color. Slowly whisk in the warm milk, increase the heat to high and continue whisking until the sauce begins to thicken and the raw taste of the flour has been cooked out, about 5 minutes; season with the salt and pepper. Keep warm. Yield: 2 cupsFor the eggs: Beat the eggs in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Melt the butter over low heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the eggs and cook slowly, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until soft curds form. Slice each biscuit in half and put a sausage patty on the bottom of each biscuit and place the other half on top. Serve 2 sausage biscuits per person. Serve with cream sauce and scrambled eggs."

S'Special equipment: a medium cast-iron skillet and four 5-inch cast-iron skilletsFor the poblano relish: Heat the oil in a medium skillet until it shimmers. Add the onion and cook for 1 minute (just to take rawness off but still keep it crisp). Smash the garlic cloves, sprinkle with salt, and mash to a puree using the side of your knife blade. Add it to the onion along with the chiles. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, to just heat through, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the lime juice and cilantro.For the Denver omelet frittatas and crispy hammy croutons: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place four 5-inch cast-iron skillets on a baking sheet and heat in the oven.Add the oil to a medium cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the ham, sprinkle with pepper and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels.Add the bread to the rendered fat and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to another plate lined with paper towels.Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until very light and fluffy. Stir in the Monterey Jack, Cheddar and Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the cooked ham and a few tablespoons of the poblano relish.Carefully remove the baking sheet with the hot skillets from the oven and brush each with some softened butter. Quickly divide the egg mixture among the skillets, filling almost to the top, and immediately return to the oven. Cook until the eggs are puffy, lightly golden brown and just cooked through, about 15 minutes. Top each frittata with more poblano relish and some hammy croutons. Garnish with cilantro.'

Let cool.Add the butter and zest to the reduced lemon juice and mix until smooth. Fold in the chiles and season with salt and pepper. The butter will keep in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 1 week.For the grilled lobster tails: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lobster tails and boil for 4 minutes. Remove and drain well. Split each lobster tail lengthwise down the underside with a heavy knife, taking care not to cut through the back shell, so that the lobster is still in one piece but the inside is exposed.Heat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat.Brush the lobster flesh with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the tails flesh-side down on the grill and grill until slightly charred, about 3 minutes. Flip over, brush with a generous amount of lemon-red Fresno butter, and continue grilling until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes, brushing with butter throughout.Remove from the grill to a platter, flesh-side up. Top with a little more butter, some cilantro leaves and lemon zest.'

S"Heat the cream in a small saucepan over low heat.Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over high heat and cook, without stirring, until amber brown, about 8 minutes. Slowly whisk in the warm cream, blackberry puree and liqueur and cook until smooth and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract.  Let come to room temperature.French Toast:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Put a baking sheet in the oven.Whisk together the eggs, sugar and salt in a large baking dish until smooth.  Add the pumpkin puree, ground spices, milk, 1/4 cup of the heavy cream, vanilla and rum and whisk until smooth.Put 4 slices of the bread in the custard mixture and let sit for 2 minutes.  Carefully turn over the slices and let sit until the bread is completely soaked through, about 2 more minutes.While the bread is soaking, heat 3 tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat until the mixture begins to sizzle. Cook the 4 slices of the bread until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip over and continue cooking until the bottom is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer.  Remove to the baking sheet in the oven to keep warm.  Wipe out the pan with paper towels and repeat the process with the butter, oil and remaining 4 pieces of bread.Combine the mascarpone and remaining 1/4 cup of heavy cream in a bowl and using a stand mixer or hand-held mixer, beat until fluffy and smooth.  Scrape the mixture into a bowl and fold in a few tablespoons of the blackberry-caramel sauce.   Put the sauce into a small saucepan over low heat and heat or put it in the microwave for a minute or so to just warm through.Remove the French toast from the oven and arrange them on a serving platter. Top 4 slices of the toast with a large dollop of the blackberry-caramel mascarpone and some of the blackberries. Cover with the remaining 4 pieces of toast and drizzle each with some of the warm blackberry caramel sauce. Sprinkle with confectioners\\' sugar, garnish with fresh mint sprig and serve."

S'Toasted Burger BunsDivide the meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with salt and pepper.IF USING A GRILL: Heat a gas grill to high or heat coals in a charcoal grill until they glow bright orange and ash over. Brush the burgers with the oil. Grill the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the first side, about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey. Flip over the burgers. Cook beef burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the second side, 4 minutes for medium rare (3 minutes if topping with cheese; see step 3) or until cooked to desired degree of doneness. Cook turkey burgers until cooked throughout, about 5 minutes on the second side.IF USING A GRILL PAN: Heat a grill pan over high heat on top of the stove. Cook the burgers as for a grill, above.IF USING A SAUTE PAN OR GRIDDLE (PREFERABLY CAST IRON): Heat the oil in the pan or griddle over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Cook the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the first side, about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey. Flip over the burgers. Cook beef burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the second side, 4 minutes for medium rare (3 minutes if topping with cheese) or until cooked to desired degree of doneness. Cook turkey burgers until cooked throughout, about 5 minutes on the second side.Add the cheese, if using, to the tops of the burgers during the last minute of cooking and top with a basting cover, close the grill cover, or tent the burgers with aluminum foil to melt the cheese.Sandwich the hot burgers between the buns and serve immediately.'

S'Whisk together the creme fraiche, mustard and hot sauce in a small bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.Set a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, turning once, about 8 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel-lined plate, and then cut the slices into thirds.Add the red onions to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and starting to caramelize, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the mustard greens, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until just starting to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, and then transfer the greens to a bowl.Whisk together the eggs, egg yolk and half-and-half in a baking dish until smooth. Add the Parmesan and some salt and pepper; whisk until combined.Spread the bread slices with some of the creme fraiche mixture, and top with a slice of Gruyere. Top half of the slices with 3 or 4 pieces of bacon and a little mound of greens.  Turn the remaining slices, cheese-side down, on top of the greens and press down to make sandwiches.Working in batches of two, soak the sandwiches in the egg mixture on both sides until just soaked, about 2 minutes per side.Heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. (If you have a skillet large enough to cook all four sandwiches at once, add all of the oil and butter now.) Add two sandwiches to the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, and fry until crisp, golden and cooked through on both sides, about 5 minutes per side--cover the pan if needed to help the cheese melt, and adjust the heat to prevent the French toast from burning. Repeat with the remaining oil, butter and sandwiches.Halve the cooked sandwiches on the diagonal and serve hot.'

S'Heat the butter and canola oil in a cast iron pan over high heat until the butter begins to sizzle. Add the onion and cook until soft and slightly caramelized.While the onions are caramelizing, put the potatoes in a large pot of cold, salted water, bring to a boil and cook until nearly tender, but a knife inserted into the centers still meets a little resistance, 10 to 12 minutes, or cooked through. Drain well and smash with the back of a wooden spoon.Add the potatoes to the onions packing it evenly with the back of a metal spatula to form a cake. Season with the paprika, salt and pepper and cook until the underside is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Invert a plate or baking sheet without sides over the pan and carefully invert the potato cake onto it. Carefully slide the potato cake back into the skillet and cook until the bottom is just set and pale golden brown, about 4 minutes. Spread the cheese on top, cover the pan with a lid and let melt. Transfer the potato cake to a cutting board cheese-side up and cut into wedges. Garnish with chopped fresh chives.'

S'Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook until soft.  Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.  Add the red peppers and cook for 1 minute.Add the tomatoes, bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a food processor and process until smooth.  Return the mixture back to the pot, add the parsley, basil and oregano and season with salt and pepper.  Cook for 10 minutes longer and season with honey, if needed.To dry out the bread crumbs:Preheat the oven to 300 degree F.Evenly spread the breadcrumbs on a large baking sheet and place in the oven.  Bake for 5 minutes, turn the oven off and let the breadcrumbs sit in the oven for 30 minutes or until just dry.Raise the temperature of the oven up to 400 degrees F.  Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 15 by 10 by 2-inch baking dish and set aside.Place the breadcrumbs into a large shallow bowl.  Add the herbs, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  In another medium shallow bowl, whisk the eggs and 2 tablespoons of water together.Season each eggplant slice on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge each eggplant slice in the flour, tapping off excess, then dip it in the egg, and finally dredge it in the breadcrumb mixture.  Shake off any excess breading and transfer the eggplant to a baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining eggplant.Heat 1/2-inch of oil in 2 large straight-sided saute pans over medium heat until the oil reaches a temperature of 385 degrees F.  Working in small batches, fry a few of the eggplant slices, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch.  Using tongs, transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining eggplant.Cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish with some of the tomato sauce and arrange 1/2 of the eggplant over the sauce.  Cover the eggplant with some of the sauce, grated mozzarella, fontina, Romano cheese and some of the basil.  Repeat to make 3 layers ending with the sauce.  Top with the fresh mozzarella and remaining Romano and bake until hot and just beginning to brown, about 30 minutes.  Let rest 10 minutes before serving.'
