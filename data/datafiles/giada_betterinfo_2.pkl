Stir the sugar, butter, cream, and honey in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the almond mixture. Cool the batter for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Using 2 teaspoons of batter for each cookie, spoon 8 mounds of the batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly apart (the cookies will spread). Flatten the batter slightly with your finger.Bake the cookies until they are lacy and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Gently slide the parchment paper with the cookies onto a rack and cool completely. Transfer the cookies to paper towels. Repeat with the remaining batter, lining the baking sheets with clean parchment for each batch. (The cookies can be made up to this point 2 months ahead. Cool completely, then store airtight in the freezer. Defrost before continuing.)Stir the chocolate in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until the chocolate melts. Spread the melted chocolate over the bottom of 1 cookie. Top with a second cookie, bottom side down, pressing lightly to adhere. Repeat with the remaining cookies and chocolate.'

Season the chicken cutlets with the pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt and drizzle with the olive oil. Place the cutlets on the grill pan and cook until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Squeeze the lemon juice over the cooked chicken while it is still on the grill pan. Remove the chicken to a plate.To assemble the sandwiches, spread about 1 tablespoon of the pesto on each slice of bread. Place 2 pieces of tomato on 4 of the slices.

S"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Cut a 3/4-inch wide strip off each side of the pastry and reserve. Roll out the pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface to a 10-inch square. Brush the edges of the square with the egg. Working with 1 strip at a time, stand the strips along the edges of the pastry square and crimp where they meet. You want to create a shallow box, where the pastry square is the base and the 4 strips are the walls. Overlap the strips at the corners, stretching them if necessary to complete the walls of the box. Brush the border with the egg. Pierce the center of the pastry all over with fork. Bake until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely.Using an electric mixer, beat the cream until soft peaks. With the mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add the liqueur and beat until just well blended; be careful not to overmix or the whipped cream will turn into a buttery consistency and start to separate. Using a large spatula, fold in the nuts. Spoon the cream mixture into the prepared pastry crust. Arrange the berries over the cream. Sift the cocoa powder over and serve.NOTE: You can use any fruit that\\'s in season (orange segments, berries, plums, bananas, grapes). Blueberries make a good substitute for the raspberries, and sliced peaches or nectarines are delicious as well."

S'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Using a sharp thin knife, cut a slit into the flesh side of the veal chop almost to the bone. With your hand placing pressure on the top of the chop, move the knife in a slicing motion to form a 3-inch pocket in the chop. Cover the chop with a piece of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet or a small heavy skillet, gently pound the chop until it is about 1/3 inch thick. Remove the plastic wrap and discard. Stuff one piece of the fontina cheese into the pocket and close the meat around it. On one side of the chop, place 3 small sage leaves on the meat. Cover the sage leaves with 2 pieces of cheese and follow that with 2 pieces of prosciutto. Turn over the chop and repeat on the other side.Place the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow dishes and season each of them with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Season the flour with the pepper. Dredge both sides of the prosciutto-wrapped veal chop in the flour and shake off the excess. Then place the chop into the egg, followed by the panko, packing the breadcrumbs on to the chop to help them stick.In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the breaded chop and cook until the breadcrumbs on the first side are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Using tongs or a spatula, carefully flip the chop and continue to cook until the other side is golden brown as well. Remove the chop to a baking tray and roast in the oven until cooked to 155 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the veal to rest for 5 minutes before serving.Serve topped with Parmesan shavings and fried sage along with grilled lemon on the side if desired.'

S'Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.Place the hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven until fragrant and light golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. Finely chop nuts and set aside.Lightly butter a 9-inch-diameter glass or ceramic pie dish. Place 2 1/2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan and stir over medium heat until melted. Stir in 1/4 cup brown sugar, agave and lemon juice. Pour the butter and sugar mixture into the prepared pie dish. Sprinkle 1/3 cup toasted hazelnuts evenly over the syrup in the dish and set aside. Mix the remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a small bowl.Gently unroll the crescent roll dough on a lightly floured work surface and firmly press and pinch the perforations together to make a solid piece of dough. Roll out the dough to a 12-by-9-inch rectangle using a lightly-floured rolling pin. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture evenly over the dough to within 1/2-inch of the edges. Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup hazelnuts on top.Starting at one short side, roll up the dough jelly roll-style. Cut the roll crosswise into 8 to 10 rounds, each about 1-inch-wide, using a sharp knife. Arrange the rounds, cut-side down, atop the syrup in the pie dish, with 6 around the edges of the dish and 2 in the center. Pinch open ends together with fingertips to prevent the rolls from unraveling. Cover and chill. Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.Bake the rolls until deep golden brown on top and the juices are brown and bubbling around the edges of the dish, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the rolls stand 1 minute. Place a platter atop the pie dish and the invert rolls onto the platter. Sprinkle the rolls lightly with the sea salt flakes. Cool the rolls for 10 to 20 minutes and serve while still warm.'

S'Pork: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Rub 1 tablespoon of the oil over the pork and season with salt and pepper, to taste. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat. Add the pork and brown it on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer the pork to a 13 by 9 by 2-inch glass baking dish and roast it until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the pork registers 165 degrees F, about 25 to 30 minutes. Allow the pork to rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board.Sauce: In the same skillet used for the pork, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, peppers and garlic and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring frequently until softened, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the wine and cook for 2 minutes, scraping up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in the paprika, tomato puree and the bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and transfer the mixture to a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth. Season with 2 tablespoons salt and pepper, to taste.Slice the pork thinly and arrange on a platter. Spoon the sauce on top, garnish with chopped parsley and serve.'

S'Heat a large braising pot over medium-high heat. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Sear the beef, browning it on both sides, about 5 minutes a side. Carefully add the stock and enough water to just cover the meat. Add the onion, celery, and bay leaf. Bring the liquid to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 1 hour. Add the carrots and potatoes and cook until the meat is tender, about another hour. Carefully lift out the meat, place on a cutting board, and cover with foil. Strain the vegetables from the stock. Discard the celery, onion, and bay leaf. Arrange the carrots and potatoes on a platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Continue cooking the stock uncovered over medium heat until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the meat against the grain, on an angle. Arrange the meat alongside the carrots and potatoes on the platter. When the stock has reduced, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and transfer to a gravy dish. Serve the Bollito Misto with the gravy and bowls of the Gorgonzola Sauce and the Salsa Verde.'

Add the shallots, garlic, egg, prosciutto, Parmesan and 1/4 teaspoon salt and mix with a wooden spoon to evenly distribute the prosciutto. Add the turkey and parsley and mix well. Divide the mixture into 2 even oblong loaves.Heat 2 medium skillets over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter to each pan. Add a loaf to each pan and cook on all sides until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Divide the white wine between the two pans and cook until reduced by half. Add the remaining 2 cups milk and 1/4 teaspoon salt to one of the pans and bring to a simmer. Add the marinara to the other pan and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat under each pan to medium low and cover the pans. Braise until an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees in the center of each loaf, about 25 minutes, carefully flipping the loaves about halfway through.Remove the loaves from the pan and allow them to rest 10 minutes before slicing. Remove the marinara from the heat and stir with a wooden spoon. Simmer the remaining milk, uncovered, until it reduces by half. It will be slightly brown and look broken. Using an immersion blender, blend the milk until fully emulsified and creamy. Serve each polpettone with its respective sauce.'

S"Pavlovas: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until thick, about 2 minutes. With the machine on medium-high speed, gradually add the sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Add the salt, cream of tartar and lemon zest. Increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture holds stiff peaks, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drop 8 (1/2) cupfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Using the back of a spoon make a 1 1/2-inch diameter well in the center of each meringue. Bake for 2 hours. Turn off the oven and allow the meringues to cool completely in the oven for 2 hours. Store airtight in a plastic container for up to 1 week.Berries: In a small bowl, toss together the berries, sugar and lemon juice. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.Cream: In a small bowl, mix together the cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth.Assembly: Put the meringues on small plates and spoon a dollop of the mascarpone cream into the wells. Top with the berries and serve.Cook\\'s Note: If using blueberries, gently mash them with a fork before mixing with the sugar and lemon juice.Cook\\'s Note: The meringue mixture can also be placed in a pastry bag fitted with a large, plain tip (recommended: Ateco # 9808) and piped onto the baking sheet."

S'To make the turkey: Position the rack in the lowest third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Rinse the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels. Place the turkey on a rack set inside a large roasting pan. Place the orange and lemon wedges, onion, and 2 sprigs of each fresh herb in the main turkey cavity. Tie the legs together to hold the shape of the turkey. Stir 2 tablespoons of butter, the herbes de Provence, oil, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of each the salt and pepper in a small saucepan over medium heat just until the butter melts. Rub the butter mixture all over the turkey and between the turkey breast meat and skin. Place the turkey neck and giblets in roasting pan. (Recipe can be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before roasting.)Cover the turkey breast with foil. Roast for 20 minutes. Pour 3 cups of broth into the pan and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining sprigs of fresh herbs to the pan. Roast the turkey for 40 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Remove the foil from the turkey; pour 1 more cup of broth into the pan. Continue roasting the turkey until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F to 175 degrees F or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with a skewer, basting occasionally with pan juices, about 1 hour and 30 minutes longer. Transfer the turkey to a platter and tent with foil. Let stand 30 minutes while preparing the gravy. To make the gravy: Strain the turkey pan juices from the roasting pan through a sieve and into a 4-cup glass measuring cup; discard the solids. Spoon off the fat from atop the pan juices. Add enough chicken broth, about 1 to 2 cups, to the pan juices to measure 4 cups total. Melt the remaining butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the broth. Simmer until the gravy thickens slightly, whisking often, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the turkey with the gravy.'

Grill the peaches until the grill marks are formed, slightly softened and heated through, about 5 to 6 minutes total. Meanwhile, stir the sugar, brandy, and lemon juice in a medium bowl to blend. Set the brandy mixture aside.As the peaches are ready, remove them from the grill and place them in a shallow baking dish. Top them with the brandy mixture, and toss to coat. Set aside for 15 minutes and allow to marinate, tossing occasionally.Meanwhile, stir the mascarpone and vanilla in a small bowl to blend. Divide the grilled peach mixture equally among 6 coupe dishes. Pour the wine over the peaches. Dollop the mascarpone mixture atop the peaches, and serve.'

S'Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat the eggs and sugar in another large bowl until pale yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the orange and lemon zests to the dry ingredients. Add the flour mixture to the eggs and sugar and beat just until blended (the dough will be soft and sticky). Let stand for 5 minutes.Using a rubber spatula, transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet, forming two mounds spaced evenly apart. Moisten your hands with water and shape the dough into two 11 by 4-inch logs. Bake until lightly brown, about 35 minutes. Cool the logs for 5 minutes. Using a serrated knife, cut the logs crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick diagonal slices. Arrange the biscotti cut side down on the same baking sheet. Bake until the biscotti are pale and golden, about 25 minutes. Cool the biscotti on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Using a metal spatula, transfer the biscotti to a rack and cool completely. Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, about 1 1/2 minutes total. Dip 1 cut side of each biscotti into the melted chocolate. Gently shake off the excess chocolate. Place the biscotti, chocolate side up, on the baking sheet. Refrigerate until the chocolate is firm, about 35 minutes. Dip a pastry brush in the cocoa, then lightly brush the cocoa over the chocolate on each biscotti. The biscotti can be made ahead. Store them in an airtight container up to 4 days, or wrap them in foil and freeze in resealable plastic bags up to 3 weeks.'

S'For the crust: Mix the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor. Add the butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add the ice water and pulse until moist clumps form. Gather the dough into a ball; flatten into a disk. (If the dough still crumbles and does not form into a ball, add another tablespoon of ice water.) Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.For the filling: Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Combine the apples, 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon juice in large bowl; toss gently to blend. Set aside for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour and roll out the dough on the paper to an 11-inch round. Transfer the dough and parchment paper to a large heavy baking sheet. Spoon the apple mixture over the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, leaving the apples exposed in the center. Pleat loosely and pinch the dough to seal any cracks. Brush the crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar.Bake the crostata until the crust is golden and the apples are tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack; cool for 10 minutes. Slide a metal spatula under the crust to free the crostata from the parchment. Cool the crostata to lukewarm. Sprinkle with the almonds and serve.'

Spread one-quarter of the frosting on top of the cake, leaving a 1/4-inch edge. Place the top half of the cake on the frosting, smooth-side up and gently press down to seal the cake halves. Use a rubber spatula to spoon the rest of the frosting on top of the cake. Using a small offset spatula, push the extra frosting over the sides and the top. Smooth the sides until completely covered. Smooth the top of the cake or make a decorative pattern. Store the cake in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Bring the cake to room temperature for 15 minutes before serving.

S"Working with 1 slice of prosciutto at a time, cut the prosciutto lengthwise in half. Wrap a small bundle of the fennel slices (about 3 slices) with prosciutto, allowing the fennel to extend over each side of the prosciutto. Bundle 1 strip each of the orange, red, and yellow bell peppers, then wrap each bundle with prosciutto, allowing the bell peppers to extend over each side of the prosciutto. Wrap the prosciutto around the stalks of broccolini. Wrap the prosciutto around the stem end of the cauliflower florets. Arrange the vegetables on a platter.Drizzle with the oil. Using a grater or vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan over the vegetables. Sprinkle with pepper, and serve.Recommended Wine: 2002 Terruzi & Puthod Terre di TufiOrigin: San Gimignano, Tuscany Grape: VernacciaWine notes:  For this dish I picked a white wine from a little town in Tuscany.  This wine is made from vernaccia grapes and is very luxurious in texture.  There is a wonderful perfume to this wine, similar to wild flowers and freshly cut grass.  The crudite gives it an extra mineral edge which makes this wine a perfect match with my dish.  I like to serve this chilled but not too cold because the colder the wine,  the more difficult it is to taste it.Wine Pouring Notes:  Do not fill above the curve of the bowl, never more than 1/2 full, that way you can get a true sense of the wine\\'s aroma and a better sense of its bouquet.  To get the full experience of the wine, place your nose into the glass and take in the wine\\'s beautiful aroma."

S'For the rice: Heat a 3 1/2-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, shallots, garlic and salt. Cook until soft and fragrant, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Add the rice and toast for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the white wine and soy sauce and cook, stirring often, until the wine is almost entirely absorbed. Combine the vegetable broth and 1 cup water in a measuring cup. Add 1/2 cup of the broth mixture to the pot and cook, stirring, until almost completely absorbed, about 4 minutes. Continue adding the broth mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next. Cook until the rice is tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes in all. Stir in the artichokes. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool for 15 minutes. Stir in the basil and then spread the rice out on a baking sheet to cool completely, about 20 minutes.For frying: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat, heat the olive oil and vegetable oil until they register 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.Set up a breading station with the flour, almond milk and breadcrumbs in separate, shallow containers. Using a small ice cream scoop, scoop about 2 tablespoons of the cooled rice mixture into your hands and gently roll into a ball. Dredge the rice ball in the flour, then in the almond milk and finally in the breadcrumbs, packing them firmly. Repeat with the remaining rice.In batches of 4 or 5, fry the rice balls until golden brown on the outside and warmed through, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.Serve with marinara for dipping, if desired.'

It\\'s important to leave the pineapples on the grill, untouched so that you can create the grill marks.While the pineapples are cooking, whisk the mascarpone and vanilla in a small bowl to blend. Set aside.Combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small bowl and stir to combine. Place in a microwave on high for about 2 minutes, stirring every 20 seconds to blend well.

Stir the lemon juice into the preserve and spread the preserves  on top of dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks in the dough.Bake the crostata until the crust is golden, 35 to 40 minutes.

Stir in the blueberries.Using a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut the pie dough into 12 circles. Place the dough on the prepared baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the edges of the dough with the beaten egg. Place about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cheese mixture in the center of the dough. Fold the dough in half to enclose the filling and pinch the edges to seal. Using the tines of a fork, gently crimp the sealed edges. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.While the pastry is chilling: In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don\\'t have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) Fry the turnovers for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until golden. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with sugar while still hot. Cool for at least 10 minutes before serving."

Spray the parchment with cooking spray.For the brownie layer: In a large bowl, blend together the brownie mix, vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water, espresso powder and eggs. Using a hand mixer, beat for 1 minute on medium speed. Pour the batter into one of the prepared pans. Sprinkle with the coconut and bake until a toothpick inserted about 1 inch from the edge of the baking dish comes out clean, 25 to 27 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for 1 hour.Using the excess parchment paper as handles, lift the brownie layer from the pan. Run a thin spatula underneath to loosen it from the parchment paper. Keep the oven on.For the cookie layer: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars in a large bowl until fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and egg. Add the flour mixture and beat until a dough forms. Stir in the chocolate chips. Using your fingers, press the dough evenly into the bottom of the other prepared baking dish, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Bake until light golden, 14 to 16 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes.Sprinkle the walnuts over the crust.For the caramel: In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the caramel candies, 2 tablespoons water and vanilla over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the candies have melted and the mixture is smooth, about 10 minutes. Pour the caramel evenly over the cookie layer. Working quickly, place the brownie layer on top of the caramel. Gently press the brownie layer into the caramel. Refrigerate for 1 hour until the caramel has set.  Allow the layers to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Cut into 24 bars and store airtight in a plastic container.'

S'Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a heavy baking sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray. Set aside. In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat. Season the beef with salt and pepper and brown on all sides, for about 5 minutes. Transfer the beef to the prepared baking sheet and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 125 degrees F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the beef from the oven to a cutting board. Cover the meat loosely with foil and let rest for 20 minutes.Sauce: In a blender, combine the pineapple chunks and syrup, the orange juice, lemon juice, soy sauce, sugar, arrowroot, garlic, ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Blend until smooth. Heat the same skillet used for the beef over medium-high heat. Add the sauce and scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Simmer until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes Season with salt, to taste.Cutting across the grain, slice the meat into 1/4-inch thick slices and arrange on a platter. Garnish with orange slices, if using. Pour the sauce into a serving bowl and serve alongside the beef.'

Spray the parchment paper lightly with vegetable oil cooking spray.Blend the biscotti, butter, cocoa powder and brown sugar in a food processor until the mixture forms moist crumbs. Firmly press the crumbs onto the bottom of the pan. Bake for 15 minutes. Cool the crust completely, about 25 minutes.Spread the jam in an even layer over the crust using a spatula.For the filling: Place the chocolate in a small bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and smooth.Beat the cheese, sour cream, eggs, granulated sugar and vanilla until smooth, using a whisk, in a medium bowl. Pour the batter over the cooled crust. Randomly spoon the melted chocolate over the batter. Swirl the chocolate into the batter, using the tip of a knife. Bake until light golden and the center of the filling jiggles slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 40 minutes. Transfer the baking dish to a wire rack and cool for 1 hour. Cover the pan with plastic and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight until firm.Run a thin spatula around the sedges of the pan to loosen the filling.

Stir in the coconut milk and sugar and bring to a boil. Add the chicken and stir to coat with the sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes.For assembly: Preheat a nonstick grill pan over medium-high heat. Layer the 2 halves of a Swiss chard leaf perpendicular to each other on a cutting board to create a cross shape. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the rice into the center where the leaves meet and flatten the rice into a rectangle. Layer 2 tablespoons of the chicken filling evenly over and top with an additional tablespoon of rice to cover the chicken. Fold the top and bottom of the Swiss chard leaf over the filling to make a small square package. Repeat with the remaining leaves, rice and chicken.Grill the packages in batches until the leaves are charred on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Serve warm.'

S'Garnish: 2 1/2 ounces goat cheese, slicedIn a medium pot warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until tender and starting to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the potatoes and the stock. Bring the stock to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat and continue to simmer, covered, until the potatoes are almost tender, about 20 minutes. Add the arugula and lettuce to the pot and continue simmering, uncovered until the greens are tender, another 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes and greens to a blender. Pour in enough of the stock to cover the vegetables. Add the cream, salt, and pepper. *Blend the ingredients together until smooth. Be careful to blend slowly at first with a kitchen towel held tight to the top of the blender lid. Blending hot ingredients can cause the lid to blow off. Pour the blended soup back into the pot with the remaining stock. Stir to combine. Cover and keep warm.Pour the soup into 4 serving bowls. Top each soup with 1/2-ounce sliced goat cheese. Serve immediately.* When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.'

Add the egg, lime juice, and vanilla. Process until smooth. Add the rice flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Process until the mixture forms a dough. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for 20 seconds. Form the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 20 minutes.Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly flour a work surface. Cut the dough in half and roll out each piece into a 9-inch diameter circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut the dough into 10 circles and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Gather any scraps of dough, knead together, and roll out to 1/4-inch thick. Cut out 2 additional rounds of dough and place on the baking sheet. Bake until light golden around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes and transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes.For the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, lime zest, and lemon juice until smooth. Spread about 1 teaspoon of the glaze onto each cookie leaving, a 1/4-inch border around the edge. Allow the glaze to harden for about 45 minutes before serving.'

When the broth comes to a simmer reduce the heat to low. Add the butternut squash to the simmering broth and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon remove the butternut squash to a side dish. Turn the heat on the broth down to very low and cover to keep warm.Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until tender but not brown, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with the butter. Add the wine and simmer until the wine has almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the simmering broth and stir until almost completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking the rice, adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition to of the broth to absorb before adding the next, until the rice is tender but still firm to the bite and the mixture is creamy, about 20 minutes total. Discard the vanilla bean. Turn off the heat. Gently stir in the butternut squash, Parmesan, the remaining tablespoon of butter, and salt. Transfer the risotto to a serving bowl and sprinkle with chives. Serveimmediately.'

S'Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap the outside of the pan with foil.For the rice: Bring the marinara sauce and rice to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool.For the bechamel sauce: Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Simmer over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the salt and nutmeg.For assembly: Mix together the bechamel sauce, rice mixture, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, prosciutto and peas in a medium bowl. Slowly mix in the eggs, salt and pepper.Pour the mixture into the prepared springform pan and cover with foil. Place in a shallow roasting pan. Add enough hot water to come halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake for 1 hour.Preheat the broiler. Remove the foil and sprinkle the top with the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan and the breadcrumbs. Broil just enough to melt the cheese and create a crispy crust, about 2 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes. Loosen the risotto from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the edge. Remove the sides of the pan. Cut into wedges and serve.'

Continue to whisk until the polenta begins to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until the polenta is very thick and tender, stirring often with a flat-bottom spoon or heatproof rubber spatula to prevent sticking or burning, about 20 minutes. Blend the corn in a mini processor until a coarse puree forms. Stir the corn puree into the polenta. Season with more salt if desired.'

S'Special equipment: six 3-ounce serving bowls or espresso cupsIn a small saucepan set over medium heat, bring the orange juice to a boil and cook until reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile in a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the sugar, the salt and yolks until smooth. Whisking constantly, add half of the reduced orange juice to the yolk mixture to temper. When it is all incorporated, return the tempered yolk mixture to the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula to prevent the eggs from scrambling, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 7 minutes. Strain the mixture into a clean bowl and whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, and the zest. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the mixture and refrigerate until chilled through, at least 5 hours.Pour the heavy cream into a medium bowl, and add the vanilla and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Using an electric mixer, beat the cream on medium speed just until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful avoid over-beating. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold half of the whipped cream into the chilled orange mixture. Pour that mixture into the remaining whipped cream and continue to fold until completely incorporated. Divide the mixture among six 3-ounce serving bowls or espresso cups. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.When ready to serve, put the gingersnaps in a resealable plastic bag and smash gently with a rolling pin. Sprinkle on top of the mousse, and serve.'

S'Combine the heavy cream and tea bags in a small saucepan. Place the pan over medium-low heat and warm gently, stirring occasionally, until bubbles just start to form around the edges of the cream, about 5 minutes. Simmer 3 minutes more and then turn off the heat.Place the chopped chocolate and salt in a medium bowl. Strain the hot cream mixture through a fine-mesh strainer over the chocolate and let sit for 3 minutes. Slowly whisk the now-melted chocolate into the cream, starting with small circles in the center of the bowl and moving into larger circles as the mixture begins to come together; stop when smooth and completely blended. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the ganache and refrigerate for about 3 hours, or until just set and cold but still pliable.Place the cocoa powder in a shallow bowl. With a 1-ounce scoop, scoop level rounds of the ganache into your palm and gently roll into a ball. Roll the truffles in the cocoa powder to coat, then place in an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to serve.Just before serving, sift a touch of gold dust, if using, over the top of the truffles for sparkle.'

While the pan heats, season the fish with salt and pepper. Rub the herbs de Provence and minced garlic all over the fish. Cook the fish in the skillet until just cooked through and golden, about 2 to 3 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish.Cut the bread into 4 sandwiches that will accommodate the size of the fish fillet. Cut the bread in half to make a top and bottom for the sandwich. Spread the Lemon Aioli on both halves of the sandwich. Top the bottom half with a handful (about 1/2 cup) of arugula greens. Top the arugula greens with the cooked swordfish, and top the sandwich with the remaining bread.Serve immediately.'

S'For the orange glaze: Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray.In a small saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter, orange juice, honey and salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring gently to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the glaze thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 7 minutes. Pour the glaze into the cake pan and set aside.For the orange roll filling: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, orange zest, cinnamon, salt and cloves. Pour over the butter and use a fork to stir the mixture until it resembles wet sand. Set the filling aside while you make the dough.For the orange roll dough: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and melted butter. Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until a shaggy dough forms.Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead gently until smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Roll the dough out into a 12-by-9-inch rectangle. Spread the reserved filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Starting at one long end, gently roll the dough into a log and pinch the seam. Slice the log into 8 even pieces and place the rolls cut-side down onto the glaze in the cake pan.Bake until the rolls are golden and the filling is dark and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool the rolls in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn them out onto a platter, spreading any leftover glaze from the pan over the top of the rolls. Allow to cool slightly before serving.'

S'Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut four large pieces of parchment paper into 14-inch hearts by folding the paper in half and cutting half of a heart shape (like you would to make a paper valentine). Set aside.In a medium bowl, toss together the fennel, kale, 2 tablespoons of the oil and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Open the hearts so the tip is facing toward you. Place two slices of orange on the right side of each heart, close to the center. Divide the vegetable mixture on top of each set of orange slices.Place a piece of fish on top of each mound and season each fillet with 1/8 teaspoon of the remaining salt and 1/8 teaspoon fennel pollen. Drizzle each piece of fish with 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining oil. Top each fillet with one of the remaining orange slices. Close the heart so it is now just a half of a heart and rotate it so the mound is facing you and the tip is away from you. Begin to make small folds, each one overlapping the last, around the edge of the package to seal the edges. When you get to the tip, fold the point under the packet. Place the packets on a baking sheet and cook until the packet is slightly brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Using scissors or a small pairing knife, cut open the top of the each packet carefully, as the escaping steam will be hot. Serve in the parchment packets for easy clean up.'

Finely grind the biscotti in a food processor. Add the melted butter and process until the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumb mixture over the bottom (not the sides) of the prepared pan. Bake until the crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Cool the crust completely on a cooling rack.Blend the cream cheese and ricotta in a food processor. Add the mango puree, eggs, and sugar and pulse until the mixture is smooth.Pour the mango mixture over the crust in the pan. Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the cheesecake is firm and moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack to cool for 30 minutes. Place in the refrigerator and cool completely, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.For the Basil Lemon Syrup: Place the sugar, water, and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the sugar is dissolved. Cool the syrup completely. In a food processor combine the basil and the cooled syrup. Pulse until the herbs are finely chopped. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve.Slice the cheesecake and place on a serving plate. Drizzle with the syrup and serve.'

Brush the inside of the crust with some of the egg white to coat. Pour the apple filling into the crust. Unroll the second crust and place on top of the filling. Pinch the edge of the top crust and the edge of the bottom crust together to seal. Fold the double edge under and crimp, making a decorative edge. Brush the top of the pie with more of the egg white. Cut several slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.Bake the pie until the crust is deep golden and the filling is bubbling through the slits, about 1 hour. Cover the edges of the pie with foil if the crust browns too quickly. Cool the pie for about 20 minutes before serving.'

Add the shallot and saute until tender but not brown, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with the butter. Add the wine and simmer until the wine has almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the simmering broth and stir until almost completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking the rice, adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition of the broth to absorb before adding the next, until the rice is tender but still firm to the bite and the mixture is creamy, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter, 2 tablespoons of Parmesan, mascarpone cheese, the lemon zest and juice, and the salt and pepper.To serve, cut 1/4-inch off the bottom of each lemon so they stand on their own. Take 1-inch off the stem end. Using a grapefruit spoon scoop out the flesh of the lemon and discard. Fill each lemon with about 1/2 cup of risotto. Sprinkle the tops with the remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan. Serve immediately.'

S'For the crust: Combine the flour, salt and baking soda in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the butter and mix on low speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. With the machine running, slowly add 1/3 cup water and mix until a dough forms, adding more water if needed, 1 tablespoon at a time. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Form the dough into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 1/4-inch-thick circle, about 9-inches in diameter. Brush with olive oil. Grill for 4 minutes per side. Let cool slightly.For the filling: In a large skillet, heat the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, leeks, shallot, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes. Add the kale and cook until wilted, about 6 minutes. Add the broth and cranberries. Bring to a boil and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper.For the cheese layer: In a food processor, combine the gorgonzola, cream cheese, sour cream, honey, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Blend until smooth.Using a spatula, spread the cheese layer evenly over the crust. Spoon the filling on top. Cut the tart into slices and serve.'

Using your fingers, work all the ingredients together until well combined. Rub the herb mixture over the pork chops. Cover with plastic wrap and reserve in the refrigerator.About 20 minutes before the onions are finished, remove the pork chops from the refrigerator. Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Grill the pork chops to medium, about 7 minutes a side depending on thickness. To serve, spoon the onion marmellata over the pork chops. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley. Serve immediately.'

S"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.Use paper towels to pat the whole fish dry. Score the skin of each branzino by making two shallow cuts on a slight diagonal on each side of the fish. Season each branzino inside and out with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.Slice 1 tangerine crosswise into 8 rounds (discard any seeds). Halve and squeeze the other tangerine to get 1/4 cup juice.Stuff the cavity of each branzino with the sliced tangerine, oregano sprigs and rosemary sprigs. Close the belly slightly around the filling and tie loosely with a piece of butcher\\'s string to help hold the filling inside.Heat a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Working one at a time, place the fish in the pan and allow it to sear for 3 minutes, pressing down gently to ensure even browning and crispness. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the first side is golden-brown and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes longer, then flip the fish and repeat on the other side until the fish is golden-brown and crisp, about 4 minutes.Transfer the fish to the prepared baking sheet. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan and repeat with the other fish. Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook until the fish are cooked through and the flesh is flaky, about 8 minutes. Remove the fish from the oven and untie and discard the string. Let the fish to rest for 4 minutes.While the fish rests, in a small bowl whisk together the Dijon mustard, chopped oregano, tangerine juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 4 teaspoons olive oil. While the fish is still warm, drizzle the vinaigrette over the fish and serve."

S'For the Mousse: In a small saucepan over medium heat stir together the milk with the sugar and the espresso powder until the milk is hot, but not boiling, and the sugar is dissolved. Place the chocolate chips in a blender.*Pour the hot milk over the chips. Run the blender on high until combined, a few seconds. Add the egg whites and run the blender on high until light, about 1 minute. Transfer the mousse to 4 small serving cups. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until firm, about 3 hours.For the Cream: In the bowl of an electric mixer, stir together themascarpone cheese and the orange juice until smooth. Add the cream,powdered sugar, and orange zest. Whip until the cream has soft peaks, about 1 minute. Whip the cream just before serving the mousse or cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until ready to serve.* When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.'

Whisking constantly, cook until the butter has melted and the mixture has formed a smooth sauce, about 8 minutes.Spread the bacon out on a small baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, just to begin to render the fat. Set aside.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and simmer until just barely tender and still bright green, 5 minutes. Remove the Brussels sprouts to a baking sheet to cool slightly. Slice each Brussels sprout in half.Preheat a grill pan over medium heat, and spray with nonstick cooking spray.Assemble the skewers: Start by threading a Brussels sprout half onto a skewer, then add a piece of bacon, then another Brussels sprout, followed by another piece of bacon, and finishing with a Brussels sprout. Repeat in this way until all of the skewers are assembled. Brush the skewers lightly with bourbon glaze.Place the skewers on the prepared grill pan and grill, brushing them with glaze with every turn, until the bacon is beginning to crisp and the Brussels sprouts are starting to char, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to a serving platter and serve warm, drizzled with any remaining glaze.'

Gradually beat in the flour mixture until a dough forms.Using about1 1/2 tablespoons of dough at a time, roll the dough between your palms into 5-inch-long fingers about 1/2-inch thick. Firmly press a sliced almond into the end of each finger to make fingernails. Make several horizontal cuts, about 1/4 inch deep and 1/2 inch long, in the center of each finger to make knuckles. Press the dough on either side of the cuts to shape the knuckles. Arrange the fingers on the prepared baking sheet and bake until light golden, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer the fingers to a wire rack and cool completely.In a small saucepan, heat the jam over low heat until warm, about 2 minutes.

Shape into golf-size balls. In a large skillet heat the oil over medium high heat. When almost smoking, add meatballs and without moving or turning the meat, allow it to brown for about 3 minutes. Turn meatballs and brown other side. Continue to cook until all sides are golden brown, about 8 minutes total. Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Lower heat and allow meatballs to simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off heat and keep warm on stove. Be careful not to over handle the meatballs since they are soft and fragile.In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander. Do not rinse pasta with water since you want to retain the pasta\\'s natural starches so that the sauce will cling to the penne. Remove meatballs from sauce and place in serving bowl. Pour some tomato sauce over meatballs, but leave about 2/3 cup of sauce in skillet. Place the cooked penne into the skillet with the remaining sauce and toss well. Pour sauced pasta in a large serving bowl. Serve alongside the meatballs. Sprinkle remaining Romano on top."

Cook over very low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 7 to 10 minutes.Place a strainer over a medium bowl and pour the warm custard mixture through the strainer. Stir in the vanilla and hazelnut spread until it dissolves. Chill mixture completely before pouring into an ice cream maker and follow manufacturer\\'s instructions to freeze. To serve, scoop gelato into serving bowls and top with hazelnuts.Yield: about 4 cups gelato"

S'Chicken: Season the chicken on all sides with salt and pepper, to taste, and put in a 1-gallon size resealable plastic bag. In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, curry powder and cayenne pepper until smooth. Pour the buttermilk mixture over the chicken and seal the bag. Refrigerate for 3 hours.Breading: In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, bread crumbs, paprika, salt, and pepper.In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour in enough oil to fill the pan about 1/3 of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 325 degrees F. (If you dont have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 2 minutes.) Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off, and dredge in the flour mixture. Fry, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, until golden and cooked through, about 6 to 7 minutes, depending on the size of the drumettes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.Arrange the chicken on a platter and serve.'

S'Special equipment: forty 4-inch skewers or decorative toothpicksPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Spray a 10-by-5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Cut a piece of parchment paper to line the bottom and the two long sides of the pan, leaving 2 inches of overhang on either side.In a large bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, milk, eggs and mustard. Set aside to soak for 5 minutes. Add the peppers, shallots, turkey, basil and salt, and mix well with your hands until fully combined. Press the meatloaf mixture into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.Bake until the meatloaf reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, about 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then run a knife along the two parchment-free sides of the pan to release the loaf. Using the paper as handles, lift the meatloaf from the pan to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature.When cool, place the meatloaf back in the pan and fold the parchment over the top to cover. Place a weight or heavy object on top of the loaf to press, and then place the whole thing in the refrigerator to chill completely, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.To serve, unmold the meatloaf and cut it into 1-inch squares. Using 4-inch skewers or decorative toothpicks, skewer a grape, a piece each of celery and apple, and, lastly, a cube of meatloaf to use as a base. Stand the skewers upright on the meatloaf.Serve cold or at room temperature.'

Working buttered side down, spread each slice with 1 tablespoon of the marinara. Divide the cheese mixture among 6 slices of the bread, and sandwich with the remaining slices. For each sandwich, sprinkle the top piece of bread with 1 tablespoon of the remaining Parmesan. Flip, and sprinkle the other side with an additional tablespoon of Parmesan.To make all of these sandwiches at once, heat 2 baking pans in the oven for 10 minutes. Spray the bottom of one of the pans with cooking spray, and place the buttered and Parmesan-ed sandwiches in the pan. Spray the underside of the second pan, and place it on top of the sandwiches. Bake until golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted, 10 minutes.Cut each sandwich into 3 pieces. Using a few shreds of mozzarella cheese as glue, make a face using the black olive slices as eyes, the green olive slices as a nose, and the pepperoni slices as a mouth. Melt for 4 minutes in the oven to adhere.Serve with marinara for dipping if desired.'

Bake until the crostini are pale golden and crisp, about 15 minutes.Blend the bell peppers and mayonnaise in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Season the bell pepper mayonnaise, to taste, with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate.Tie the beef with kitchen string to help maintain its shape. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add the beef to the skillet and cook until brown and cooked to desired doneness, about 8 minutes for rare. Freeze the beef until it is just frozen (this will make it easier to slice), about 3 hours. Using a large sharp carving knife, cut the beef into thin slices.Spread the bell pepper mayonnaise over the crostini and top with the sliced beef. Arrange the crostini on a platter. Scatter over the capers, sprinkle with the coarse sea salt, and serve.Do-Ahead Tip: The bell pepper mayonnaise and sliced beef can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and refrigerate.Alternative: If desired, the beef tenderloin can be substituted with 1 pound freshly sliced roast beef. Since the roast beef is already cooked and can be used as is, it makes a great time-saving alternative.'

S'Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.In a large nonstick skillet, cook the bacon, over medium heat until crisp and brown. Transfer the bacon to paper towels; drain and cool.In a large bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, hot sauce and eggs. Combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and pepper in a food processor. Drop in the cold butter cubes. Using on/off turns, blend until the butter is cut in finely and the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Pour the dry ingredients over the buttermilk mixture. Scatter the bacon and green onions over the batter. Using a thin, flexible spatula, fold the batter together, scraping up the liquids from the bottom each time and turning the bowl as you fold. Do not over-fold; some dry patches are fine. Using a rounded 1/3 cup of batter for each muffin, fill the paper liners.Bake until puffed and browning at edges, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.  Let the muffins stand 5 to 10 minutes. Twist each muffin in place to loosen the edges from the pan. Lift the muffins out onto a rack and cool.'

S'Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.Unroll the crust on a lightly floured work surface. Using floured fingertips, seal any tears in the dough. Sprinkle the dough very lightly with flour. Using the bottom paper to lift, turn the dough over into 9-inch-diameter ceramic or glass pie dish. Peel off the remaining sheet of paper. Trim the dough overhang to 3/4 inch. Fold the overhang under and form a smooth top edge. Crimp the edge decoratively. Pierce the bottom and sides of the crust all over with a fork. Chill the crust at least 10 minutes.Bake the crust until deep golden around the top edge and light golden on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F.Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta cook until brown and crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain and cool, reserving the pancetta drippings in the skillet.Add the zucchini, shallots and garlic to the skillet. Saute over medium heat until the zucchini is just barely tender, tossing occasionally, 5 to 6 minutes. Cool the zucchini slightly, about 10 minutes.In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and cream. Add the cheese, basil, cooled pancetta, mustard, salt, pepper, nutmeg and cooled zucchini mixture. Whisk to blend. Pour the custard into the cooled pie crust.Bake the quiche until the sides are slightly puffed and brown and the center is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on a rack 20 to 30 minutes, and then serve warm or let cool completely and serve at room temperature.'

Set aside.In a medium bowl, mix together the cornbread mix, buttermilk, melted butter, eggs, olives, scallions, and cheese until the mixture forms a thick, lumpy batter. Using a spatula spread the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow the cornbread to cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares and serve.Cook\\'s Note: To remove the cooked cornbread easily from the baking dish, first line the bottom and sides with 2 pieces of parchment paper, each 7 inches wide and 15 inches long, allowing the excess parchment paper to overhang the sides. When cooked and cooled, use the excess parchment paper as handles to remove the cornbread from the pan. Peel away the parchment paper and cut into squares."

Heat the oil in a medium skillet set over medium heat, about 3 minutes to get it hot. Add one of the dough rounds to the hot pan. When the dough begins to bubble on the top and the bottom is golden brown, flip to cook the other side, 2 minutes per side. Remove the crust from the pan to a plate and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the Parmigiano-Reggiano evenly over the whole surface. Sprinkle with some of the lemon zest and a few of the thyme leaves. Drape 4 slices of the mortadella over the pizza. Repeat with the remaining pizza dough, and then serve.'

Set aside.In a blender, combine the ricotta cheese, mascarpone cheese, eggs, heavy cream, maple syrup, sugar, and salt. Using a paring knife, split the vanilla bean in half and scrape the seeds into the blender. (Reserve the seeded vanilla pod for the sauce.) Blend the mixture until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until puffed and lightly browned. Remove the muffin cups from the oven to a wire rack and cool for 30 minutes (puddings will deflate during cooling). Refrigerate the puddings, in the muffin cups, for 2 hours. Using a thin, flexible spatula, carefully remove the puddings from the muffin cups and discard the parchment paper from the bottom of the puddings.For the sauce: In a medium saucepan, combine the reserved vanilla pod, cranberries, water, orange juice, orange zest and 1/2 cup sugar over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat and gently simmer until the mixture has thickened and the liquid has reduced by half, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes. Remove the vanilla pod and sweeten with extra sugar, to taste, if necessary.To serve: Arrange the puddings on small dessert plates and spoon the sauce over the top.'

Lay out one sheet of puff pastry and roll it with a rolling pin just to flatten slightly. With the pastry set at an angle so that one corner is facing you, spread half of the mortadella mixture onto the half of the puff pastry that is closest to you. Brush the edges with some of the remaining beaten egg. Fold the pastry corner farthest from you over the filling to form a calzone-shaped triangle. Seal the edges either by crimping with your fingers or by using the tines of a fork. Set the pizza on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush the outside with the remaining egg wash. Cut a slit in the top for ventilation. Repeat with remaining sheet of puff pastry and the remaining filling. Bake for 30 minutes, or until puffed, golden and cooked all the way through.Let rest for 10 minutes before cutting.'

S'For the galette: Position a rack in the center and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and sprinkle with the salt. Saute until almost tender, tossing occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Whisk the sugar, spices and arrowroot in a small bowl until no cornstarch lumps remain. Sprinkle the spiced sugar and lemon juice over the apples in skillet, and toss to blend. Cool to lukewarm.Place a large sheet of parchment paper on the work surface. Unfold the pastry sheet on the parchment and sprinkle both sides lightly with flour. Roll out the pastry to 12-inch square, lifting, turning and sprinkling with more flour to keep from sticking. Cut off the corners (with a rounded cut), making a 12-inch-diameter pastry round.Brush the pastry all over with some beaten egg. Starting 2 inches in from the edge (to leave wide border), arrange the apple wedges close together in a circle on the pastry. Arrange the remaining apples in a smaller circle in center (ends may overlap first ring of apples). Fold the pastry border partially over the filling, pleating the pastry in loose folds. Brush the folded-up pastry border with some beaten egg. Slide the galette with the parchment onto a heavy baking sheet. Scrape the juices from the skillet over the apples. Bake galette until pastry edge is deep golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.Meanwhile, make the topping: Toss the goat cheese, almonds and cherries in a medium bowl until evenly distributed (the cheese should remain in distinct pieces). Chill until ready to use.Remove the galette from the oven. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the filling. Return the galette to the oven and bake for 5 minutes longer to soften the cheese and cherries. Cool 20 minutes and serve warm, or cool for 2 hours to serve at room temperature.'

S"Butter a 9-inch springform pan. Line the bottom and sides with parchment paper.For the tomato layer: In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and cool slightly. Stir in the tomatoes. Return the pan to the heat and add the red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture has formed a chunky sauce, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.For the bechamel sauce: In a 1-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Stir in the nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Simmer over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.For the pesto: In a food processor, combine the basil, Parmesan, pine nuts, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Pulse until finely chopped. With the machine running, gradually add the olive oil until the mixture forms a smooth paste.Stir the pesto into the bechamel sauce until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.For the polenta: In a large, heavy saucepan, bring 6 cups water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil over medium-low heat. Gradually whisk in the cornmeal. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and the cornmeal is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter.To assemble the torta: Working quickly, spread half of the warm polenta in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan. Add the pesto mixture and spread on top of the polenta. Spoon the remaining polenta on top and smooth with a spatula. Spread the tomato mixture on top. Cool the torta at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the layers have set, about 4 hours.Remove the outer ring from the pan, then remove the parchment paper. Place the torta on a platter and cut into thin wedges. Serve with grilled bread.Cook\\'s Note: To toast the pine nuts, arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until lightly toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool completely before using."

S'For the risotto: Puree the corn and Parmesan in a food processor until paste-like and almost completely smooth. Set aside.Heat a 3 1/2-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and butter, and heat until the butter is melted. Add the shallots and garlic; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until soft and fragrant, 2 minutes. Add the salt and stir in the rice; cook for one minute. Deglaze with the wine and reduce the heat to medium; simmer, stirring, until the wine is almost fully absorbed. Stir in the chicken broth and rosemary; cook, stirring often, until the rice is tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the corn puree.Spread the risotto out on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Let cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold.For the arancini: Set up a breading station with three shallow bowls. Combine the flour and salt in the first bowl; whisk the eggs in the second bowl; mix the panko and cornmeal in the third. Using a 1-tablespoon ice cream scoop, scoop a ball of risotto into the palm of your hand. Press a piece of chicken sausage into the center of the ball, then shape the ball to make sure it is completely covered. Roll the ball in the flour, then in the egg, and, finally, in the breadcrumbs, making sure the ball is completely coated. Place the arancini on a rimmed baking sheet and continue with the remaining risotto.Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Fry the arancini in batches of 5 or 6, using a spider or slotted spoon to carefully lower the rice balls into the oil. Fry until deep golden brown and heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel-lined tray.Serve warm with marinara for dipping, if desired.'

Since the bread crumbs will cook quickly, you don\\'t want to add them into a hot pan, otherwise they can burn. Add the breadcrumbs and stir constantly. Season lightly with salt and pepper since flavored bread crumbs may already have seasoning. Saute for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.Drain pasta in a colander. Working quickly, add pasta to the saute pan and stir to combine. Add Parmesan and the chopped prosciutto. Mix thoroughly. Pour into large serving bowl and garnish with chopped parsley."

S'For the custard: In a small saucepan, bring the milk and lemon zest to a boil over medium heat. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes.In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour and egg yolks (the mixture will be thick). Pour the milk mixture into the bowl, whisking until smooth. Return the mixture to the saucepan and whisk slowly and constantly over medium-low heat until smooth and thick, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. Whisk in the lemon juice and vanilla until smooth. Transfer the custard to a clean bowl and lay a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface. Refrigerate for 2 hours.For the meringue: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water over medium-high heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. Boil, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes. Let the syrup cool for 1 minute. While the sugar mixture is cooking, in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to high and beat until the egg whites hold soft peaks. Reduce the speed to low and carefully drizzle the hot syrup down the side of the mixing bowl. Beat at high speed until the egg whites hold stiff, glossy peaks, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the lemon juice.Fold the custard into the meringue, then spoon into serving bowls or cups. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.For the topping: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. In a food processor, blend together the flour, brown sugar and butter until the mixture begins to form into clumps, about 20 seconds. Add the cookies and pulse until the cookies are crushed into 1/4-to-1/2-inch pieces. Pulse in the almonds until combined. Arrange the mixture in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the almonds begin to brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes.Sprinkle the topping over the meringue custard and serve.Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S'For the hollandaise: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat or in the microwave. Combine the yolks, sage, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a food processor or blender and pulse to incorporate. Carefully drizzle the hot butter into the processor and keep blending until the sauce is thick and creamy. Pour the sauce into a small bowl and set aside.For the stuffing cakes: Place the stuffing in a large bowl, breaking up any large clumps. Add the eggs and breadcrumbs and stir to combine, making sure all of the stuffing is evenly coated with the eggs. Scoop 1/3 cup of the stuffing into your hands and shape into a patty, about 3-inches wide and 1/2-inch thick. Repeat to make 6 stuffing cakes. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and cook the cakes, two at a time until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and repeat with the remaining cakes. Loosely cover with foil to keep the cakes warm.Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook the pancetta until browned and crispy, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.To assemble, fill a small saucepan with 3 inches of water, and add the lemon juice and salt. Bring the water to a simmer over medium heat. Crack an egg into a small heatproof bowl and use the bowl to slowly slide the egg into the water. Use a wooden spoon to carefully stir the water around the egg. Cook the egg until the white has set and the yolk is still soft, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Remove the egg from the water with a slotted spoon and drain it on a paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining eggs. To serve, place one stuffing cake on a plate. Top with 2 slices of pancetta, a poached egg and a generous drizzle of hollandaise sauce.'

The pasta should measure about 3 cups.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease the muffin tin.In a blender combine the eggs, milk, cream, and mascarpone cheese. Blend until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the cut pasta, prosciutto, mozzarella cheese, Asiago cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

S'Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Drain. Toss with the sun-dried tomatoes. Set aside to cool completely otherwise the hot pasta could curdle the eggs when you add them later on.In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, salt, and pepper, Parmesan, and fontina to blend. Add the cooled spaghetti mixture; toss to coat.Preheat the broiler. Melt the butter and oil in a 9 1/2-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium heat. Transfer the spaghetti mixture to the skillet, pressing to form an even layer. Cook until the bottom is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the broiler. Broil until the top is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Cool in the skillet to room temperature.Invert the torta onto a platter. Cut into wedges and serve at room temperature.'

S'In a small bowl combine the chicken, ricotta cheese, lemon zest, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine. On a dry work surface place 8 wonton wrappers. Place a rounded teaspoon of the chicken mixture in the center of each wrapper. Using a pastry brush, brush the egg wash around the chicken mixture. Bring four corners of the wonton square together over the filling to form a purse. Press the edges together tightly to form a seal. Wipe the board with a towel until dry and continue making batches of 8 with the remaining wonton skins  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Addthe purses and cook until they float to the surface, stirring occasionally, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain the ravioli. Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a medium skillet. Turn off the heat, add the cooked pyramids and gently toss. Transfer the pyramids to 4 serving plates. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.'

Place the turkey breast in a 9 by13-inch roasting pan. Spread the mustard mixture over the top and sides of the turkey to form a crust. Add the onions, carrots, and chicken stock to the pan. Roast for 45 minutes. Cover the pan loosely with foil and continue to bake for another 45 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 175 degrees F. Allow the turkey to rest for 20 minutes before serving. Remove the vegetables and arrange on a serving platter. Remove the turkey and place on a cutting board. Pour about 1/2 cup of the pan juices into a small saucepan. Whisk in the flour until smooth. Whisk in the remaining pan juices. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes until the mixture thickens. Season the pan juices with salt and pepper and pour into a serving pitcher. To serve, slice the turkey into 1/4-inch slices.

S"For the lamb: Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, rosemary, pepper flakes and walnuts. Toast until fragrant and beginning to brown. Add the chopped spinach and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and cook until wilted. Stir in the raisins.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Spread the lamb out flat, fat-side down, on a board in front of you. If it is still very thick, gently pound it to an even, 1-inch thickness. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and the 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spread evenly with the mustard; distribute the spinach mixture over the mustard. Starting from one side, roll up the lamb with the filling inside so that it maintains the shape of the leg. Tie with butcher\\'s twine at 2-inch intervals. Season the outside with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.Wipe out the saute pan and add the remaining tablespoon olive oil. Place the pan over high heat and allow it to get hot. Place the lamb in the pan and sear it on all sides until golden brown all over, about two minutes per side. Transfer the lamb to a rimmed baking sheet or a roasting pan and roast until the internal temperature registers 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove to a cutting board and rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing.While the lamb is roasting, prepare the gremolata: In a small saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the panko and cook, stirring regularly, until golden brown. Add the parsley, lemon zest, pepper flakes and salt. Toss and set aside to let the flavors mingle.Serve the sliced lamb with a sprinkling of the breadcrumb gremolata."

S"In a small saucepan combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Add the lemon segments and simmer for another 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and cool the lemons in the liquid. Using a slotted spoon, remove the segments from the liquid and reserve both for later use.In a medium bowl, whisk together the mustard and 2 tablespoons of the reserved lemon liquid. Whisk in the olive oil, basil and 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. Reserve half of the dressing for the fish. Add the arugula, olives and reserved lemon segments to the dressing but do not toss. Set aside.Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Dry the fish well using paper towels and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the olive oil. Grill the steaks until golden brown and the fish release easily from the pan, 3 to 4 minutes per side depending on the thickness of the steaks. Toss the salad in the dressing and add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place a piece of fish on each plate and top with some of the salad. Spoon the reserved dressing around the fish.Cook\\'s Note: In America, I suggest using tuna steak. In Italy, swordfish was readily available."

S"Bring 2 cups water and the figs to a simmer in heavy small saucepan over high heat. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, turning occasionally, until the figs are very tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer the figs and 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid to a food processor (or add some water to make 1/2 cup). Blend until the figs are pureed and no large lumps remain. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and chill. (Fig puree can be made 1 week ahead.)Whisk the whipping cream, sugar, maple syrup, salt and egg yolks in a heavy large saucepan until blended. Whisk over medium heat until the custard thickens enough to coat a spoon (and the temperature registers 170 degrees F to 180 degrees F), 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately whisk 1/2 cup of the fig puree into the custard, reserving the remaining fig puree. Transfer the custard to a bowl and chill uncovered until cool, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.  Whisk in the sour cream and brandy.Process the custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Transfer to a bowl, cover tightly and freeze until firm, at least 6 hours and up to 3 days.Scoop the ice cream into goblets or bowls. Spoon some Brandied Maple-Fig Sauce on top, sprinkle with pine nuts and serve."

Using a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter, cut out circles from the dough. Knead together any scraps of dough and roll out again. Continue to cut out pastry circles until there are 24 pieces in total. Place the dough circles on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cookies are slightly golden around the edges, about 10 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Reserve 1 parchment paper-lined baking sheet.Combine 1 cup of chocolate chips and the cream in a small bowl. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the peppermint extract and refrigerate the mixture for 1 hour. Using a 1/2-ounce cookie scoop or a tablespoon measure, place the chocolate mixture in the center of the flat side of 12 of the cookies. Place the remaining cookies on top and gently squeeze to distribute the filling evenly. Place on a baking sheet and freeze until the filling has set, about 25 minutes.Combine the remaining chocolate chips and the vegetable oil in a small bowl. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Dip the top of each cookie in the melted chocolate and return to the baking sheet.

Trim the outside of the base until no dark green areas remain. Cut the artichokes in half and then into quarters. Cut out the fibrous choke and small purple-tipped leaves. Submerge the artichoke quarters in the lemon water. Cover and boil until the artichokes are tender, about 45 minutes. Drain. Set the artichoke quarters aside to cool to room temperature.Mix together lemon juice, herbs, garlic, lemon peel, capers, bread, and tomatoes in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.Arrange artichokes, cut side up, on 2 platters. Spoon the tomato mixture into the center of the artichoke quarters, dividing equally. Drizzle with olive oil.

S'Butter a 13 by 9 by 2-inch baking dish. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and saute until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a small bowl. Pour off all but 1/4 cup of the pan drippings (if necessary, add more oil to the pan drippings to equal 1/4 cup total). Reduce the heat to medium. Add 3 teaspoons of garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the flour and whisk for 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, whisking often, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in all the Fontina, mozzarella, Parmesan, and provolone cheeses.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni and cook until almost al dente, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. (The pasta will continue cooking in the oven.) Drain pasta and add directly into the cheese. Add the parsley, basil, and pancetta and toss to coat. Season the pasta mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper. Transfer the pasta mixture to the prepared dish.Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat. Add the bread crumbs and toss to coat. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the pasta mixture. Drizzle the top with extra-virgin olive oil and bake until the sauce bubbles and the bread crumbs are golden brown, about 20 minutes.'

S'Whisk the ricotta, spinach, prosciutto, egg yolks, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl to blend.Place 1 tablespoon of the ricotta filling in the center of a wonton wrapper. Brush the edge of the wrapper lightly with water. Fold the wrapper in half, enclosing the filling completely and forming a triangle. Pinch the edges to seal. Transfer the ravioli to baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers. (Can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead; cover and refrigerate.)Melt the butter in a heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add the oregano and stir 1 minute. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.Working in batches, cook the ravioli in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes per batch. Transfer the ravioli to a large shallow bowl.Pour the oregano butter over the ravioli and toss gently to coat. Sprinkle the pecorino over the ravioli and serve.'

S'For the artichokes: In an 8-quart saucepan, bring 8 cups water to a boil over medium-high heat. Juice the lemons into the water and add the squeezed lemon shells. Using kitchen scissors, remove the thorns from the tips of the artichoke leaves. Cut the artichoke stems to 1/2-inch long. Cut each artichoke into 8 wedges and, using a paring knife, remove the fuzzy choke. Place the artichokes in the pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pan and steam until the artichoke hearts are tender, about 20 minutes. Using tongs, remove the artichokes and arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet.Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Drizzle both sides of the artichokes with olive oil and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Sprinkle with the chopped garlic and rosemary. Grill, cut-side-down, until lightly charred, 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Set aside to cool slightly.For the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, whisk together the creme fraiche, olive oil, vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper until smooth.Arrange the artichokes on a platter and serve the vinaigrette alongside as a dipping sauce.'

S'Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served, use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method.'

S'To make the milk chocolate sauce: Combine the cream and honey in a small heavy saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat and add the chocolate. Let stand until the chocolate melts, about 2 minutes, then whisk to combine. Cool the sauce slightly, then pour into a clear glass serving bowl or small pitcher. (The sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Cool completely, then cover and refrigerate.) Re-warm the sauce in the microwave, if necessary.To make the whipped cream: Using an electric mixer, beat the cream and sugar in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Transfer the whipped cream to a serving bowl. (The whipped cream can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)For the sundaes: Place each topping in a separate serving bowl. Scoop the gelato or ice cream into dessert bowls and drizzle with the milk chocolate sauce. Allow guests to sprinkle their desired toppings over their sundaes. Top with the whipped cream and cherries, if desired.'

Continue with the remaining top slices of bread.While the top slices of the bread are in the Panini machine, begin forming the sandwiches. Divide the cheese among the warm bread. Cover the cheese with slices of fruit. Drizzle the fruit with honey. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with a handful of arugula. Place the warmed top half of the bread over the arugula and return the competed sandwich to the panini machine for 1 to 2 minutes more to finish melting the cheese. Remove from the panini machine.

Add the frozen peas and cook until the peas are tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the peas in a mesh sieve.Place the peas in a food processor with the mint, salt, and pepper. Puree the pea mixture. Place the pea puree in a medium bowl and refrigerate until cool, about 30 minutes.Meanwhile, for the crostini: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the baguette slices on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Bake in the oven until toasted and golden around the edges, about 10 minutes. While the crostini are still warm, drizzle the tops with extra-virgin olive oil. Using a whole clove of garlic in your fingertips, rub the top of the crostini a few times to give a hint of garlic.To finish, whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the pea puree. Top each of the crostini with about 1 tablespoon of pea puree. Sprinkle with a bit of the diced prosciutto. Serve immediately.'

S'Kebobs: Put the salmon, halibut and tuna in a resealable plastic bag. In a medium bowl whisk together the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper.  Pour the oil mixture over the fish and seal the bag. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Thread each skewer with 2 pieces of salmon, 2 pieces of halibut and 2 pieces of tuna, alternating the fish on the skewers. Butter: In a small bowl, mix together the butter, garlic and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the butter to the center of a 6-inch-square piece of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic over the butter and form it into a log, about 4-inches long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Refrigerate until firm, about for 1 hour. Slice the butter into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices and transfer them to a plate.Put a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Season the fish with salt and pepper, to taste, and grill the skewers until opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Arrange the skewers on a platter and serve the butter alongside.'

S'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Lightly grease the mini-muffin tins with vegetable oil spray. Place 1 teaspoon of slivered nuts in each of the muffin cups. Unwrap the caramel candies, cut each candy into quarters and place 4 quarters (1 candy) in each of the muffin cups on top of the nuts in a single layer. Bake in the oven until the caramel is just melted and beginning to spread, about 8 minutes. Be careful not to over melt the caramel or it will bubble, burn, and become too hard. Place the mini muffin tins in the refrigerator for 5 minutes to cool. Remove the nut clusters from the tins and set aside.Meanwhile, melt the bittersweet chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. Wisk 2 to 3 tablespoons of cream into the chocolate to slightly thin the chocolate for coating the clusters. Dip half of the nut clusters in the bittersweet chocolate and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Return the clusters to the refrigerator to harden, about 30 minutes.Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. Wisk 2 to 3 tablespoons of cream into the chocolate to slightly thin the chocolate for coating the clusters. Dip remaining half of the nut clusters in the white chocolate and place on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet with the other chocolate-covered clusters. Return the clusters to the refrigerator to harden, about 30 minutes.'
